It tells how some Hebrew boys came to live in Babylon and serve the Babylonian king.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">God allowed the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, to defeat the king of Judah. King Nebuchadnezzar ordered his chief official to choose some boys from Judah and to train them to work in the government of Babylon. Daniel and his three friends were among these boys. They excelled in their studies and the king was pleased with the wise advice they gave.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The phrase “the Lord delivered” (“Adonay gave” in Hebrew) occurs in 1:2, the phrase “God had granted” (“Elohim had given” in Hebrew) occurs in 1:9, and the phrase “God gave” (“Elohim gave” in Hebrew) occurs in 1:17. (1:2a, 1:9, 1:17a). The author used these phrases to emphasize that the Lord is sovereign over the events of history and the lives of his people. God has authority over what happens to Gentile nations and also what happens to his people. This is the theme of this chapter.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027001001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027001002\"><h3>Paragraph 1:1–2</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 1:1–2 gives the setting for the first section of Daniel. It tells how God allowed the king of Babylon to defeat the king of Judah.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Daniel 1:1–2 there are several names of people and places that may be new to your readers. Introduce this new information in a way that is natural in your language. English versions transliterate these names in different ways. It may be helpful to consult how the national translation translates them. It is good to include a map with your translation, showing the location of Babylon and Judah.</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ In the third year that Jehoiakim was the king of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the country of</span> Judah,</p></li><li><p>¶ There was a king of Judah named Jehoiakim. When/After Jehoiakim had reigned/ruled for more than two years,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The land of</span> Judah had a king named Jehoiakim. He was king for almost three years,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah:</strong> This phrase tells when the events of this chapter happened. The <em>third year of the reign of Jehoiakim</em> was 605 B.C.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Babylonian Chronicles record that in 605 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar won a battle at Carchemish and defeated the whole “region of Hamath” (northern Syria). He then conquered all the “Hatti country.” It was probably at that time that Judah and Jerusalem came under Nebuchadnezzar’s control. During that same year Nebuchadnezzar’s father died, and he returned to Babylon and became king in his father’s place.</span></span> In those days people dated events by referring to the kings who were ruling at that time. You should translate according to this custom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>During the third year of King Jehoiakim’s reign in Judah (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>In the third year:</strong> Jehoiakim had ruled over Judah for more than two full years when the Babylonian army came and surrounded the city of Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jehoiakim’s father Josiah had died at the battle of Megiddo in 609 B.C. Jehoahaz became king in his place. Three months later, the Egyptians decided to make Jehoiakim the king of Judah in the place of Jehoahaz. Daniel 1:1 says that the story began in the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign. However Jeremiah 25:1, 9 and 46:2 indicate that Nebuchadnezzar became king in the fourth year of Jehoiakim’s reign. The difference between these two texts is probably due to the different ways people counted the first year a king began to reign.In Egypt and Palestine, the months between the king’s accession to the throne and the following New Year were counted as “year one.” In Babylonia, the months between the king’s accession to the throne until the New Year were not counted as part of the first year. The first year of a king’s reign started at the New Year. (See Lucas, pp. 50–51.) So Daniel may have been following the Babylonian way of counting, while Jeremiah followed the Palestinian way of counting.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the reign:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>reign</em> refers to the period of time when a king rules. In some languages it may be natural to translate this using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jehoiakim reigned/ruled over Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jehoiakim king of Judah:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to place Jehoiakim’s title before his name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>King Jehoiakim, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the ruler</span> of Judah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king of Judah, Jehoiakim</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><em>Jehoiakim</em> is also mentioned in 2 Kings 23:34–24:6 and 2 Chronicles 36:4–8. See how his name is spelled there. He had a son named Jehoiachin (2 Kings 24:8 and 2 Chronicles 36:9). You should be careful how you spell these two names so that people do not confuse them.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>king:</strong> The title <em>king</em> normally refers to the hereditary ruler of a country. If your culture is not familiar with the word <em>king</em>, you may have to use a different word. In some languages people use the word “chief” or “big man” to describe a person who fills this role.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Judah:</strong> The tribe of <em>Judah</em> was originally one of the twelve tribes that had formed the united kingdom of Israel. But several hundred years before, <em>Judah</em> and another tribe (Benjamin) had left the united kingdom and formed a new kingdom with their own king. Their kingdom was called <em>Judah</em>.</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came/marched against <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p>the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">led his army</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jehoiakim’s city,</span> Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p>and then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and his soldiers/men</span> attacked <span data-bnType=\"implied\">its capital city</span> Jerusalem.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem:</strong> The text implies that Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem with his army in order to attack it. In some languages it may be natural to indicate this by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with his army</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched on Jerusalem</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon:</strong> <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> was the ruler of Babylonia from 605 to 562 B.C. Babylonia was a large nation to the east of Israel. In some languages it may be natural to put the king’s title before his name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> The name <em>Nebuchadnezzar</em> also occurs in 2 Kings 24:1, Ezra 1:7, Esther 2:6, and Jeremiah 21:2. If you have translated any of those books, translate it as you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>king of Babylon:</strong> <em>Babylon</em> was the capital city of Babylonia and the Babylonian Empire. Nebuchadnezzar ruled from the city of Babylon over the whole of Babylonia. In some languages it may be more natural to name the country rather than the city. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Both terms, <em>Babylon</em> and Babylonia, are correct. Sometimes, as here, people used the name of the city as a political term to refer to the whole country. In many cases it will be best to use the same name that the majority language translation uses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The ancient land of Babylonia included the southern part of the modern country called Iraq. This land extended approximately from the city Baghdad in the north to the city of Basra in the south. In the west, it extended approximately to the modern border of Saudi Arabia. On the east, it bordered the modern country of Iran. You may want to include a map to help your readers locate this ancient country.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The ancient city of Babylon was located in what is today the suburbs of the city of Baghdad. This is where Nebuchadnezzar built his palace. The city had many temples and beautiful gardens. The city was so beautiful that people called it one of the Seven Wonders of the World.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> In the Hebrew language, <em>Babylon</em> is called Babel. The Bible mentions Babel in Genesis 10:10 and 11:9, when the people of the east tried to build a tower that would reach up to heaven. The name of the city <em>Babylon</em> also occurs in Psalm 137:1. The name of the country Babylonia occurs in Joshua 7:21 and Isaiah 11:11.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>came to Jerusalem:</strong> <em>Jerusalem</em> was the capital city of the kingdom of Judah. In some languages it may be necessary to make this information explicit in some way. There are at least two options:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Supply this information in the text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the capital city of</span> Jerusalem</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Include the information in a footnote or book introduction.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the appropriate option for your language situation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The city of <em>Jerusalem</em> is mentioned many times in the Bible. See how you referred to it in Psalm 51:18, Mark 1:5, Luke 2:22, or John 1:19.</p><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and besieged it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">His soldiers</span> surrounded it.</p></li><li><p>They camped around the city in order to force <span data-bnType=\"implied\">its people</span> to surrender.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>besieged it:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>besieged</em> means “encircled, blockaded.” In those days, armies often surrounded a city before they attacked it. In this way they could stop the people in the city from getting food and supplies. They wanted the people to surrender without fighting. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>surrounded it with his army (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>laid siege (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>surrounded it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order to make the inhabitants surrender</span><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em>.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be necessary to use two separate verbs (“came” and <em>besieged</em>) to describe this action. It may be more natural to use just one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar and his armies besieged Jerusalem.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:1</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 1:1 may contain a lot of new information for your readers. Some languages introduce new information and new characters in a certain way. Introduce them in a way that is natural in your language. You may choose to reorder some of the information and to have shorter sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">A long time ago,</span> there was a king of Judah named Jehoiakim. In the third year of his reign, the king of the country of Babylon <span data-bnType=\"implied\">decided to attack</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Judah</span>. That king’s name was Nebuchadnezzar. King Nebuchadnezzar sent his soldiers to Jerusalem, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the capital of Judah</span>. They surrounded the city and prepared to attack it.</p></blockquote></div>",

It indicates that God allowed Nebuchadnezzar to defeat Jehoiakim and gain power over him. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord delivered King Jehoiakim of Judah into his power (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord gave him victory over King Jehoiakim (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This verse does not mean that Nebuchadnezzar personally defeated or captured Jehoiakim. His soldiers did the actual fighting under his command. So in some languages it may be necessary to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And the Lord allowed his men/soldiers to defeat Jehoiakim</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>the Lord</em> is one of the titles that the Bible uses to refer to the God of Israel. It means “master.” This title is different from the personal name for God, Yahweh, which the BSB usually spells as “the LORD,” with all capital letters. See how you translated this title in Genesis 4:4b, 6a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jehoiakim king of Judah:</strong> The author also used the phrase <em>king of Judah</em> to refer to Jehoiakim in 1:1a. In some languages it may not be natural to repeat this information here. If that is true in your language, you can refer to him in a different way, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>King Jehoiakim (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jehoiakim (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>along with some of the articles from the house of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord gave Nebuchadnezzar</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">control/possession of</span> some of the things/objects that were in the temple of God.</p></li><li><p>And he allowed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Nebuchadnezzar’s men/soldiers</span> to take/steal some treasures from the temple/building where <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of Judah</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worshiped</span> God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>along with some of the articles from the house of God:</strong> This phrase indicates that the Lord also allowed Nebuchadnezzar power over some religious items used in the worship of God. This happened when Nebuchadnezzar’s army looted or stole some of the valuable objects that were in the temple of God in Jerusalem. In some languages it may be more natural to express this idea with another verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord gave him victory over King Jehoiakim of Judah and <u>permitted him to take</u> some of the sacred objects from the Temple of God. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord let him capture King Jehoiakim <u>and seize some of the Temple treasures</u>. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>some of the articles:</strong> The Babylonians took possession of some of the things that were in the Jewish temple.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For the kinds of articles see 2 Chronicles 36:7, 10,18; Jeremiah 52:17–23 (586 B.C.); Ezra 1:9–11 (537 BC).</span></span> They did not take them all, and the Hebrews continued to worship at the temple.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>However, about twenty later (in 586/7 B.C.) the Babylonians attacked the city again. At that time they took all the things that were left in the temple and carried them away to Babylon. They also destroyed the temple itself.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>articles:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>articles</em> is a general word that can refer to a variety of items. In this context, the word is used to refer to objects the Jewish people used in worship rituals. These objects included cups, bowls, lampstands, altars, and tables. These articles were very valuable. The Israelites had made some of them from gold or silver. Some other ways to describe these things in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Temple treasures (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the things (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>objects</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>vessels (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the house of God:</strong> Here the phrase <em>the house of God</em> refers to the building where Jewish people worshiped God in Jerusalem. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the temple of God (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the key term “temple” in KBT.</p><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He carried these off to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar brought these things back to the temple/house of his god <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the city of Babylon,</span> in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of</span> Shinar.</p></li><li><p>When they went back to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their own</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">land</span> Shinar, they carried these things with them to the temple/building of the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">false</span> god whom Nebuchadnezzar <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worshiped</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He carried these off:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>carried…off</em> can mean “brought” or “carried,” depending on the context. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he brought them (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">King Nebuchadnezzar did not bring or carry anything himself. He ordered his servants and soldiers to transport everything back to his country. So it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He ordered that these be taken</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He caused them to be brought</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He caused his men to bring them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>these:</strong> Scholars differ about what the Hebrew pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>these</em> refers to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The pronoun <em>these</em> refers to the valuable articles from the temple in Jerusalem. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which he carried to Babylon and put… (NCV) <em>(BSB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The pronoun <em>these</em> refers to the human captives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He took some prisoners back with him (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English translations leave the pronoun ambiguous. It is not clear whether the Babylonian army took Jehoiakim with them back to Babylon at this time. So it is recommended that you leave this ambiguous, referring to either the captives or the treasures or both.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar’s men brought what they had taken from Jerusalem to their own temple in Babylon.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the land of Shinar:</strong> The word <em>Shinar</em> is an ancient name for the land that later became the country of Babylonia. This land is now part of modern Iraq, south of the city of Baghdad. Genesis 10:10 and 11:1–9 mention that the tower of Babel was in the land of Shinar. See how you translated the name there. There are several possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Transliterate <em>Shinar</em>, the old name for this area. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the land of Shinar (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use Babylonia, a later name for that land. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the land of Babylonia (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the name Babylon, the capital city of that land, because that is where the king’s temple was. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in Babylon (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the two names <em>Shinar</em> and Babylonia. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the land of Shinar, that is, Babylonia</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important that people do not think that <em>Shinar</em> was a different place from Babylonia. If this is not clear from your translation, you may want to include a footnote that mentions this information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the house of his god:</strong> The phrase <em>the house of his god</em> refers to the building where the Babylonian people worshiped their god.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is a textual problem here. Scholars disagree about whether the phrase <em>to the house of his god</em> was part of the original Hebrew text:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions include the phrase <em>to the house of his god</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to the temple of his god (NIV) <em>(NIV, KJV, NASB, RSV, ESV, BSB, REB, NET, GW, GNT, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some versions do not include the phrase <em>to the house of his god</em>, since they consider that this phrase was not in the original Hebrew text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These he brought to the land of Shinar, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). The author probably intended to contrast the phrase <em>house of his god</em> (1:2c) with “house of God” (1:2b ).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>his god:</strong> The Hebrew noun that the BSB translates as <em>his god</em> here refers to the god or gods of a different, non-Jewish religion. In some languages it may not be possible to use the same word to describe the true God and other gods.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em> notes that in some languages it is very difficult to use the word for God for anything other than the true God. The authors suggest that in this case translators may have to translate “the place where he worshipped” or “the house of his religion.”</span></span> If that is true in your language, there are at least two possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a different expression in your language that describes idols or spirits that some people worship.</p></li><li><p>Use a general expression that refers to a supernatural being or beings that some people worship. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one they worshiped</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">A decision about this expression is very important, so you may need to consult with church and community leaders. When you choose an expression, check it in this context with other speakers of your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>god:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>god</em> is plural in form but can be either singular or plural in meaning. English versions disagree about whether they choose singular or plural:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>god (BSB, KJV, RSV, GW, REB, CEV, NLT)</p></li><li><p>gods (NJB, GNT, NCV, NET)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), although the second view is also acceptable.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>putting the vessels in the treasury of his own gods (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>put:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar ordered his servants or soldiers to place these articles in the Babylonian temple treasury. In some languages it may be natural to indicate that he did not do this personally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>caused them to be put</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ordered his men to place them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the treasury of his god:</strong> The <em>treasury</em> was the place where the king kept the valuable objects of the kingdom of Babylon. It may be possible to indicate its purpose without saying what sort of place it was. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>temple treasury (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The treasures or valuable objects were connected with the people’s religion or dedicated to their god. The treasury was probably in their temple.

Some translations, such as the GNT, do not include a connector here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief of his court officials:</strong> This clause introduces Ashpenaz, a new character in the story. In some languages it may be natural to introduce him in a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The chief of the royal officials was Ashpenaz. The king ordered him…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the king:</strong> This refers to King Nebuchadnezzar. The text has previously mentioned two kings, so in some languages it may be necessary to say explicitly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Babylonian king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the chief of his court officials:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the chief of his court officials</em> refers to a high official in the king’s court. The word for <em>court officials</em> originally referred to eunuchs (men who cannot have sexual relations). The Babylonian kings employed eunuchs to work in the palace, especially around the women of the court. But the word came to refer to any court official, and this is probably how it is used here. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his chief official (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the chief of staff (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who was in charge of his palace officials (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to bring in some Israelites from the royal family and the nobility—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to choose for his service some of the Israelite <span data-bnType=\"implied\">youths</span> from the king&apos;s family and the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> noble/leading families.</p></li><li><p>“Select<sup>(sing)</sup> some of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the captives</span> from Israel to serve me.

The Hebrew text does not explicitly state where Ashpenaz was to <em>bring</em> the men. In some languages it may be necessary to specify a place. If that is true in your language, you may refer to the king’s palace or court. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to bring some of the Israelite men <u>into his palace</u> (NCV) Other versions specify the purpose for which the king ordered them to be brought in. For example:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to bring <u>into the king’s service</u> some of the Israelites (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this verse part include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to select from among the Israelite exiles some young men (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to choose some of the Israelites (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>some Israelites:</strong> The text literally says “from the sons of Israel.” The king wanted Ashpenaz to choose a certain number of males from any of the twelve tribes of Israel. The age of these “sons of Israel” is not stated here, but the context indicates they were to be young, probably teenagers. In some languages it may be natural to specify that these <em>Israelites</em> were to be males. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some of the Israelite men (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>From the Israelites…a certain number of boys (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The text does not explicitly say if these young men were still in Jerusalem or if they were already exiles in Babylon. There are two views:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Ashpenaz was to select young men from among the exiles whom the army had already brought to Babylon. Some English versions add this implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to select from among the Israelite exiles (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to bring to the palace some of the young men of Judah’s royal family…who had been brought to Babylon as captives (NLT) <em>(GNT, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The king told Ashpenaz to take these young men from their homeland to the palace in Babylon. <em>(RSV, NRSV, KJV, GW, and NCV allow for this interpretation.)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both interpretations are acceptable. If it is natural in your language, leave it ambiguous. If you must make a choice, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the royal family and the nobility:</strong> This phrase describes the kind of Israelites the king wanted Ashpenaz to bring to the king’s palace. The king told Ashpenaz to take young men from two groups: from the royal family of Judah and from the other important families. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>of the royal family and of the noble families (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who were of royal and noble descent (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the royal family may be considered part of the nobility. In those languages you may need to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from important families, <u>including</u> the family of the king of Judah (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of Judah’s royal family and <u>other</u> noble families (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the royal family:</strong> Ashpenaz was to choose young men who were members of the royal family of Judah. That is, he was to choose those who were closely related to the king of Judah. Some versions make it explicit that the reference is to the royal family of Judah. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the royal family of Judah (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the nobility:</strong> This refers to families of high status among the people of Judah. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>leading Jewish families (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>important families (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the clans of the elders</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:3</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the king’s command as direct speech.

This verse lists the qualities the young men were required to have. Translate this list in a way that is natural in your language. You may use either indirect or direct speech (see also the General Comments on 1:3 and 1:4–5). It may be natural to start a new sentence here and to use two or more sentences in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a-b</sup>They had to be handsome, intelligent, well-trained, quick to learn, and free from physical defects, <sup>4c</sup>so that they would be qualified to serve in the royal court.

This word can refer to boys from the time they were born to the time they were married. It is likely that they were from about fourteen to twenty years old. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>youths (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>without blemish:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>without blemish</em> indicates that the young men should have no physical handicaps or weakness. See 2 Samuel 14:25, where the same Hebrew word for <em>blemish</em> is used. The phrase <em>without blemish</em> can be translated in two major ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a positive expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>strong, healthy (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a negative expression:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>free from physical defects (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who had nothing wrong with them (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without any physical defect (NIV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>handsome:</strong> Each culture describes physical beauty in its own way. It is best to use a general term for a male whose appearance is considered pleasant, pleasing, or praiseworthy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>good-looking (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>attractive (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>gifted in all wisdom, knowledgeable, quick to understand,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They should be intelligent and knowledgeable.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>well-trained (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>well informed (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>well-educated (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>quick to understand:</strong> The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as <em>quick to understand</em> is more literally “discerning/understanding of knowledge.” It probably refers to the ability to quickly perceive and understand something. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>having keen insight (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>quick to learn (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>discerning (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and qualified to serve in the king’s palace—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and capable of serving in the royal palace.</p></li><li><p>They must be able to serve in my court.</p></li><li><p>and competent to work for me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and qualified to serve in the king’s palace:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>qualified to serve in the king’s palace</em> indicates that these men were to be capable of serving in Nebuchadnezzar’s court.

It is an idiom that refers to serving the king in some official way. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to serve in the royal court (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>serving in the royal palace (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>entering the king’s royal service (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>palace:</strong> The <em>palace</em> was not simply the king’s house. It included a throne room where the king met ambassadors and other official visitors. There was also a large courtyard in front of the throne room and a special hall for banquets. Living quarters and storage rooms surrounded these main parts of the palace. If such palaces are not known in your area, you may be able to use a word or phrase that describes the residence of an important person. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>royal court (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to teach them the language and literature of the Chaldeans.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The king ordered <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Ashpenaz</span> to teach these young men the Babylonian language.

The BSB reverses the order of the two words. This is more natural in English. Order these words in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>language:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>language</em> is literally “tongue.” Here it is probably used as a figure of speech to refer to speaking, reading, and writing in a particular language. The Babylonian language, Akkadian, used a different writing system than Hebrew did.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>literature:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>literature</em> is literally “book.” Those who advised the king had to study and know the Babylonian texts. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the learning (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the writings (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Chaldeans:</strong> The Hebrew name that the BSB translates as <em>Chaldeans</em> can indicate different groups, depending on the context. Here it apparently refers to the people of Babylonia in general. Your language may have a special way to refer to an ethnic group of people. Translate this group name in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several possibilities for translating this name:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a name that refers to the Babylonian people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Babylon people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Babylonians (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a name that is based on the name <em>Chaldeans</em>. For example, “the Chald people” or “Chaldea people.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Chaldeans (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Include a reference to both of the names above. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Chaldeans, that is, the Babylonians</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a pronoun referring to the Babylonians. Use the appropriate pronoun for direct or indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their language</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our language (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Since Babylon was already mentioned in 1:1, translating the word <em>Chaldeans</em> as “Babylonians” here may be the best choice. However, if the church in your area prefers the name <em>Chaldeans</em>, you may want to include a footnote. The footnote should explain that these two names refer to the same people.</p>",

The palace servants prepared food and drink for the use of the king’s family and courtiers. The king ordered them to give this same food and drink to the Hebrew captives. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king also gave orders that every day they were to be given the same food and wine as the members of the royal court (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The king:</strong> This refers to King Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>assigned:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>assigned</em> indicates that the king ordered his servants to give the food to the Hebrew youths. See the General Comment on 1:4–5 for a suggestion as to how to translate this order using direct speech.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>them:</strong> The pronoun <em>them</em> refers to the young men that Ashpenaz had chosen in 1:3–4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>daily provisions:</strong> The young men were to receive royal food and wine each day. The Hebrew text does not emphasize the amount or quantity. It was not necessarily rationed or limited. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every day (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the royal food and wine:</strong> This refers to food and wine of the same type that the king ate and drank. It does not refer to food that the king left on his plate for them. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they were to be given the same food and wine as the members of the royal court (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from his royal delicacies and from the wine that he himself drank (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This food and wine was probably more expensive and delicious than the food that other people ate. Try to use an expression that refers to such food. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>special food and wine from the royal table/kitchens</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>food:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>food</em> is an unusual Persian loan-word that here refers to high-quality food such as wealthy people might eat. Another way to translate this is:</p><p data-indent=\"3\">delicacies (NET)</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wine:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>wine</em> refers to an alcoholic drink that people make from a fruit called “grapes.” People usually drank wine on special occasions, especially when there was a celebration or feast.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some areas, there is no <em>wine</em> that is made from grapes. In that case, there are several options for translation:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a general term for “fermented drink.” To distinguish <em>wine</em> from beer, “fermented (fruit) juice” is a possibility.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Avoid a word that would contradict the qualities of real wine. For example, do not use a word referring to a drink made from a different fruit or a drink made from grain.</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a word for imported bottled <em>wine</em>. If there is no local word for this, you may use the word from the national or trade language.</p></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase, for example: “drink/juice made from the fruit called grapes.”</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the option that is most appropriate for your language in this context.</p><h4>1:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They were to be trained for three years,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The king told Ashpenaz to train the young men for three years.</p></li><li><p>The young men were to continue their training for three years.</p></li><li><p>Educate/Train<sup>(sing)</sup> them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this way</span> for three years,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They were to be trained for three years:</strong> The king wanted the young men from Judea to receive teaching for three years. He ordered Ashpenaz to arrange for this education.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><em>They were to be trained</em> is a passive verb. It may be more natural in your language to use an active verb and supply the subject. The subject might be Ashpenaz himself or, more likely, teachers he chose. Ashpenaz or these other teachers were to educate the young men for a period of three years. The goal was that after three years the young men would be competent enough to become the king’s officials and serve him in his court. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They were to be educated for three years. (ESV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They were to receive an education lasting for three years.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and then (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At the end of that time (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they were to enter the king’s service:</strong> This is literally “they were to stand before the king,” as in the RSV. This is an idiom. See the note on “serve in the king’s palace” in 1:4c. The idiom has at least two possible meanings in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “they were to become court officials.” These men would advise the king when he had important decisions to make. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>advisors in the royal court (NLT) <em>(BSB, NASB, GW, REB, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NIV, CEV, NLT, NET, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “they were to present themselves to the king,” that is, to be tested. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to appear before the king (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The ESV, RSV, and KJV translate the idiom literally. It is recommended that you follow option (1), as do most English versions.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:5b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine 1:5b–c into one clause with one main verb.

Some English versions leave this word untranslated. You should introduce these new important characters in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As it turned out (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Among these young men were some from Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</strong> Ashpenaz chose some young men in accordance with the king’s instructions. Among these young men were four Judeans named Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. These four were not the only ones from Judea who were chosen. See the General Comment at the end of 1:6. These four men are the main characters in the following narrative. Other ways to introduce them include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Among them were the Judaeans Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Four of the young Jews chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all from the tribe of Judah. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Among these young men:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>Among these young men</em> more literally means “among them.” The pronoun “them” refers to the young men from Israel whom Ashpenaz chose to serve King Nebuchadnezzar. The NIV adds that these were “were chosen” and the BSB adds that they were <em>young men</em>. You may wish to supply one or both of these ideas in your translation but it is not necessary if the meaning is clear without supplying that. Some possible ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Four of the young Jews chosen (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Among those who were chosen (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>among these young men (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>some from Judah:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>some from Judah</em> is more literally “from the sons of Judah.” These were young men from the tribe of Judah. The NJB refers to them as “Judeans.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may have a special way of referring to a people group or tribe. For example, some languages can say something like “Juda people.” Translate the name of this people group in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Daniel:</strong> In Hebrew, people’s names often have meanings. This name means “God is my judge.” You may want to put this meaning in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Hananiah:</strong> In Hebrew this name means “Yahweh has acted graciously.” You may put this meaning in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Mishael:</strong> Scholars are uncertain about the meaning of this name. Most think it means “Who is what God is?” Again, you may suggest this meaning in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Azariah:</strong> In Hebrew this name means “Yahweh has helped.” You may want to put the meaning of this name in a footnote.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:6</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information describing the young men. This may help to indicate that these four young men were not the only ones chosen from the tribe of Judah.

The name he gave to Daniel was <em>Belteshazzar</em>. You should distinguish the spelling of <em>Belteshazzar</em> from the similar sounding name “Belshazzar” in Daniel 5. Daniel’s new name means “may Bel protect his life” or “protect the life of the prince.” Bel was the name of one of the Babylonian gods. You may put the meaning of this name in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to Hananiah, Shadrach:</strong> Hananiah received the Babylonian name of <em>Shadrach</em>.

He wanted to remain pure/clean <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to worship God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here indicates a contrast between what the king planned in 1:5a and what Daniel decided to do. However, the two verses are separated by other information. In some languages there may be a different way of contrasting ideas that are not immediately next to each other. Indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel made up his mind:</strong> The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as <em>made up his mind</em> is literally “set in his heart.” This is an idiom. It means to make a firm decision. Some ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel determined (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel made up his mind (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel decided (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he would not defile himself:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>defile himself</em> refers here to religious defilement. A Jewish person became defiled when he came into contact with anything impure and forbidden by the Law of Moses. A person who was defiled was considered ritually unclean. He could not worship God with the rest of the community.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars are not certain why Daniel believed that eating the king’s food would defile him. Jewish laws forbade them to eat certain foods, such as the meat of pigs.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Leviticus 3:17; 11:1–47. See Collins, p. 142. He explains that “Daniel’s objection to the royal food is in the spirit of the biblical laws insofar as it is concerned with purity and defilement, even though it goes beyond the specific prohibitions of the Torah.”</span></span> The Babylonians, however, cooked and ate such foods.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, the Babylonians ate pork and horse meat (Baldwin, p. 83), but according to Jewish law it was taboo to eat the flesh of these animals. The Jews also required that all the blood be drained from meat (Lev. 17:10–14). However, Baldwin (p. 83) argues that there was no law against wine.</span></span> Also, the Babylonians offered their food to idols. The servants probably offered the king’s food and wine to their Babylonian gods before they served it to the king.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Also, Daniel knew that if he ate the king’s food, it would imply that he agreed to obey the king and his policies. He believed that if he ate the king’s food, it would not please the one true God.</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Consider how to communicate the idea of religious impurity or defilement for your culture. In some languages it may be necessary to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not to let himself become <u>ritually unclean</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to eat and drink <u>only what God had approved</u> for his people to eat (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an expression that communicates this idea in your language. Avoid expressions that people would apply only to the worship of pagan gods or spirits. You will probably need to check your translation carefully with different speakers to be sure you have communicated the correct idea.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the king’s food or wine:</strong> This is almost the same expression that was used in 1:5a, and you should translate in a similar way here. See the notes on 1:5a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with the royal rations of food and wine (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with the king’s food, or with the wine that he drank (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with the royal delicacies or the royal wine (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:8a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in 1:8a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel decided not to eat the king’s food or drink his wine because that would make him unclean. (NCV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So he/Daniel asked the chief of staff to allow him to avoid the food and drink that would make him ritually unclean.</p></li><li><p>So Daniel appealed to Ashpenaz, “Please excuse<sup>(sing)</sup> me from eating or drinking anything that would make me impure/unclean in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(excl)</sup></span> religion/worship.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself:</strong> Daniel asked Ashpenaz to excuse him from eating the king’s food and drinking the king’s wine. He said he did not want to make himself unclean by doing this. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself by doing this.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>So:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> here introduces the result of 1:8a. Because Daniel had decided not to defile himself, he asked the chief official for permission not to eat the king’s food. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>therefore (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Express the connection in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself:</strong> Daniel asked for permission not to do something. That is, he asked permission to avoid something. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He asked the chief of staff for permission not to eat these unacceptable foods (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he asked the chief official to excuse him from eating the defiling food (see REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he asked permission from the chief official to refrain from eating food that would make him unclean</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>asked:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>asked</em> literally means “to seek.” Daniel was seeking permission to avoid something that he believed to be wrong or harmful.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the chief official:</strong> This expression is also used in 1:7a. See the note there. Here again it refers to Ashpenaz. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Ashpenaz (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>not to defile himself:</strong> This is the same expression that was used in 1:8a. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to repeat the expression in exactly the same way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to use a slightly different expression with the same meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not to make himself unclean in this way (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not to eat the food and wine served in the royal palace (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:8b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to ask for permission to perform some positive action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He asked the chief official for permission to eat other things instead. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel asked to be allowed to eat only food that was clean/permitted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for Jewish people</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

God caused the chief official to be sympathetic toward Daniel. He was not hostile. We do not know if this good attitude began at this time or if Ashpenaz had always been sympathetic to Daniel. Introduce this background information in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God had granted Daniel favor and compassion from the chief official:</strong> The Hebrew text more literally says, “God gave Daniel favor and compassion before the official.” The same Hebrew verb is used in 1:2, in the phrase “the Lord delivered” where it is translated as “delivered” 1:2a. It indicates that God was controlling events in the life of Daniel and his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to express this idea in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God made…the chief officer want to be kind and merciful to Daniel. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">God influenced the chief official’s attitude toward Daniel, and so the official regularly acted kindly to Daniel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>favor and compassion:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>favor and compassion</em> indicates that the chief official was sympathetic to Daniel. The two words <em>favor</em> and <em>compassion</em> have similar meanings and together they emphasize this idea. In some languages it may be more natural to use one expression for this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God made Ashpenaz sympathetic to Daniel (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now God had given the chief official great respect for Daniel (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>favor:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>favor</em> here indicates that the chief official liked Daniel and treated him well. The same Hebrew word occurs many times in the Old Testament and is often translated as “love” or “kindness” (see, for example, Psalm 23:6 and Genesis 24:27.)</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>compassion:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>compassion</em> means “mercy” or “sympathy.” The chief official understood that Daniel was in a difficult situation and tried to be helpful and kind to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the chief official:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates here as <em>official</em> is the same as that translated as “of his court officials” in 1:3a.

Although Ashpenaz was sympathetic toward Daniel, he was still afraid of disobeying the king. Other ways to translate this connection include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nevertheless…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In spite of this…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Express the contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he:</strong> Here, the pronoun <em>he</em> refers to Ashpenaz, the chief of the kings court officials mentioned in 1:3 and 1:7. See the note on 1:3a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I fear my lord the king:</strong> These words introduce Ashpenaz’s fear. Ashpenaz’s fear was that the king would kill him if he disobeyed his orders. The situation that Ashpenaz feared never actually happened. Languages have different ways to express fears like this. Use a natural way in your language. It may be necessary to make explicit that Ashpenaz was afraid of the king’s reaction to his request. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am afraid what my lord the king will do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am afraid that my lord the king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be angry</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if I ask that</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am afraid he will kill me (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the General Comment on 1:10, which discusses reordering the verse, as the CEV has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my lord the king:</strong> Ashpenaz used two titles to refer to the king. In this way, he emphasized the authority that the king had over him. In some languages it may not be natural to use both of these titles here. If that is true in your language, there are at least two possibilities for translation:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use only the title <em>king</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase to translate <em>my lord</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king, who has authority over me</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has assigned your food and drink.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He has decided what you<sup>(plur)</sup> should eat and drink</p></li><li><p>He is the one who determined what food you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">young men</span> are to eat and what you are to drink.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who has assigned your food and drink:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar had given orders concerning what Daniel and the other young Jewish men were to eat and drink. The chief official had not made the decision himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to make this clause a complete sentence or an independent clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The king has decided what you are to eat and drink (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king determined what you should eat and drink (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your food and drink:</strong> The expression <em>your food and drink</em> means “the food you should eat and the drink you should drink.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your:</strong> This reference is plural. It refers to Daniel and all the other young men in the group who were chosen to serve the king.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:10b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder this, giving the background information first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10b-c</sup>My lord the king has ordered your food and drink, and I am afraid that…</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For why should he see your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I allow you<sup>(plur)</sup> to eat other food,</span> the king will see that you<sup>(plur)</sup> are not as healthy as the other young men of your<sup>(plur)</sup> age.</p></li><li><p>What will happen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if I do not obey him,</span> and then you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not thrive/grow as well as the other youths? If/When the king sees that,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For why should he see your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a strong statement that it would not be good for the king to see Daniel and his friends looking unhealthy. Ashpenaz was implying that the king’s food was nutritious and good for the young men. If Daniel and his companions did not eat it, they would not thrive. They would not look as healthy as the other young men who were training to become court officials. This would make the king angry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is the good/benefit of letting him see you looking worse than the other young men?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For what will happen if he sees you looking less healthy than the other young men?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a statement of possibility or a conditional clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He may see that you do not look as healthy as the other young men.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If he sees that you look worse than the other young men your age (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you become pale and thin compared to the other youths your age (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a statement of result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you do not eat the king’s food,</span> he will see that you look worse than the other young men.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a statement of fear that is connected to 1:10a.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am afraid that he will see that you look worse than the other young men.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the French Common Language translation 1997.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Express this in a way that is natural in your language. It may be natural to include the implied information as to why it would be bad for the king to see Daniel and his friends in an unhealthy state. It would make the king angry. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If the king sees that you look worse than the other young men, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will become angry</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you do not eat the king’s food</span> , you will get haggard/unhealthy. The king will see it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and will be angry</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>looking thinner than those of the other young men your age:</strong> This is a comparison. It compares Daniel and his three friends to the other Jewish youths Ashpenaz had chosen. Ashpenaz did not want Nebuchadnezzar to see Daniel and his friends appearing less healthy than the other Jewish youths. Consider how to indicate such a comparison in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>less strong and healthy than the other youths</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the other young men look healthy but you look unhealthy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not strong like the other young men</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, be careful to avoid suggesting that the other young men looked a little unhealthy and Daniel and his friends more so. The other young men were not going to appear unhealthy at all. Ashpenaz assumed they would become strong and healthy on the king’s diet.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your faces looking thinner:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>your faces looking thinner</em> is more literally “your faces looking gaunt/haggard.” See also Genesis 40:6, where the same word meaning “gaunt/haggard” is used. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>pale and thin (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>looking miserable (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>looking weak</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your:</strong> This pronoun is plural. It refers to Daniel and his three companions. Daniel’s friends had also decided not to eat the king’s special food and wine.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>those of the other young men your age:</strong> The phrase probably refers to the other captives who were in the same general age group as Daniel. These young men would have eaten the king’s diet and grown strong and healthy. Some translations omit the phrase <em>your age</em> since it is implied in the phrase <em>other young men</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the other young men (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You would endanger my head before the king!”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then he will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">command his servants to</span> cut my head off.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will be angry</span> about it and have me killed/executed.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part connects to the previous verse part with a conjunction. Many versions translate it as “then.” The RSV translates as “So.” Here it introduces the result of the king seeing Daniel and his friends looking unhealthy. The BSB does not translate this conjunction explicitly. You should introduce this verse part in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You would endanger my head before the king!:</strong> The Hebrew is more literally “you (plural) would make guilty my head with the king.” This is an idiom that probably refers to execution. Ashpenaz was afraid that the king would blame him for the poor appearance of his servants. He knew that the king might have him put to death for failing to take good care of the young men.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">We do not know what method of execution the king would have used. The king might have ordered Ashpenaz’s head cut off, but not necessarily. It is good to translate this in a general way referring to any kind of execution.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my head will be in danger with the king (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you would endanger my life with the king (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he may kill me (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will hold me responsible and I will pay with my life because of you<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>La Bible du Semeur.</span></span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:10</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew, this verse is a long, complex sentence. The main point is that Ashpenaz was afraid to agree to Daniel’s request. In some languages it may be more natural to separate the information into shorter sentences. It may also be more natural to change the order of some of the information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>But the man still told him, <sup>10c</sup>“The king has decided what you must eat and drink. <sup>10b</sup>And I am afraid <sup>10e</sup>he will kill me, <sup>10d</sup>if you eat something else and end up looking worse than the other young men.” (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

The text implies that this was a different conversation. In some languages it may be necessary to include a verb of motion here to indicate this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So Daniel <u>went to</u> the guard…. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Then:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>Then</em> here introduces what Daniel did next. Since Ashpenaz was afraid to help him, he spoke to someone else.

Its exact meaning is uncertain. It probably refers to a man who is responsible for taking care of others. This man worked under the authority of Ashpenaz. He was in charge of the young men. English versions translate this word in various ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>supervisor (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>steward (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>attendant (NLT, REB)</p></blockquote><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>whom the chief of staff had appointed to take charge of him, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Daniel said to him,</span></p></li><li><p>whom Ashpenaz had appointed to supervise him and his three friends. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Daniel made this request:</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the chief official</em> is the same one that was used in 1:7a. See the note there. In some languages it may be natural to name him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ashpenaz (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had appointed:</strong> This verb refers to an event that had already happened before Daniel went to talk to the official. Some time before, Ashpenaz had appointed a man to supervise Daniel and his three friends. Most English versions make this explicit by the verb tense they use. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had put in charge of (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had ordered a guard to watch (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Languages have different ways of indicating that certain events happened before the main events of the story.

Daniel wanted the official to allow Daniel and his friends to do as they requested for a short period of time. That time would act as a trial period. At the end of the time, the official would observe the results of their actions. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Allow your servants a ten days’ trial (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your servants:</strong> Daniel referred to himself and his three companions as <em>your servants</em>. This was a Hebrew way of showing respect and submission. In some languages it may not be clear to whom Daniel was referring. If that is true in your language, there are other possibilities for translation:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a first-person exclusive pronoun meaning “us.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Please give <u>us</u> this test for ten days.

Conclude this part of the story in a way that is natural in your language. Some versions reverse the order of these two clauses, putting the positive statement before the negative. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So from then on the guard let them continue to eat vegetables instead of what the king provided (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so after that the attendant fed them only vegetables instead of the rich foods and wines.… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After this the guard let them eat vegetables instead of the rich food and wine.

However, it seems appropriate to begin a new paragraph at this verse, as the GNT and BSB do. Daniel 1:17 introduces the climax of the chapter. God blessed Daniel and his three friends. The king was very pleased with their wisdom and he accepted them into his service.</p></div><h4>1:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ God helped these four young men to learn many/varied subjects, all the knowledge and writings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the Babylonians</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ God gave to each of these four youths the ability to study and understand every different topic/aspect of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Babylonian</span> literature and learning.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom:</strong> God helped Daniel and his three friends to benefit from their Babylonian education.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God made all four of these young men smart and able to understand all different kinds of literature and learning</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God caused these four young men to be wise and to understand all kinds of literature and learning.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>To these four young men:</strong> The BSB follows the Hebrew by putting the phrase <em>these four young men</em> first in the sentence for emphasis. In this context, the phrase <em>these four young men</em> is the topic that the author wants to focus on. See the General Comment on 1:17a for a way to reorder this verse part.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God gave:</strong> This is the third time that the Hebrew verb, translated as <em>gave</em> here, occurs in the chapter with God as the one doing the action. This key phrase divides the chapter into three parts. It emphasizes that God was in control of the events that happened in the life of Daniel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gave knowledge:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>knowledge</em> also occurs in the phrase “quick to understand” in 1:4b. See the note there. God gave the four young men the ability the king was looking for. Some ways that English versions have translated this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gave them learning (RSV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Goldingay, p. 4.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made…intelligent (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made them smart (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>understanding:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>understanding</em> can mean “insight, understanding, good sense.” Some ways that English versions have translated this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>skill (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wisdom (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>every kind of literature and wisdom:</strong> This phrase explains what kinds of things the young men could understand.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>literature:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>literature</em> means “scroll, book” or “writing.” Here it refers to the written works of the Babylonians.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>and wisdom:</strong> The young men also understood all kinds of intellectual studies. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>wisdom</em> is the same as in 1:4b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:17a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder this verse part with the subject at the beginning.

(CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And Daniel had insight into:</strong> The four men were the topic of 1:17a. <em>Daniel</em> alone is the topic of 1:17b. Introduce this shift in topic in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>had insight:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>had insight</em> means “discerned, had insight.” See the note on “quick to understand” in 1:4b. Not only did God help Daniel understand all kinds of literature and learning, but he also gave him insight into the meaning of dreams. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Daniel also could understand…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God gave Daniel special ability in understanding… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God gave Daniel the ability to understand and explain…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all kinds of visions and dreams:</strong> The Hebrew says more literally “all visions and dreams.” The Babylonians studied and classified different kinds of dreams. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every kind of vision and dream (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>visions and dreams (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>visions and dreams:</strong> Prophets often had visions. A vision is like a dream, except that a person is usually awake. Sometimes he may be in a trance. In visions, people see and hear things that they would not ordinarily see and that other people cannot see or hear. In the Bible, God often gave a prophet a special vision when he had something important to communicate to his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In contrast to visions, dreams usually occur at night when people are asleep. However, in the book of Daniel, these two words overlap in meaning. If your language has a word for <em>dreams</em> but it does not have a word for <em>visions</em>, you may have to use a descriptive phrase to translate the meaning of <em>visions</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dreams and other special messages from God</p></blockquote>",

The Hebrew text connects this verse to the previous verse with a common conjunction that several English versions translate as “And.” Here it introduces a clause that adds to the praises of Daniel and his friends in 1:19. The BSB does not explicitly translate this conjunction. Introduce this clause in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Whenever the king asked for advice (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every time the king asked them about something important (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No matter what question the king asked or what problem he raised (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In every matter of wisdom and understanding:</strong> This refers to any question or problem that a person needed wisdom to answer or solve. In some languages it may be necessary to make this connection between <em>matter</em> and <em>wisdom and understanding</em> more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>about things <u>that required</u> wisdom and insight (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the things that only a wise person could understand and advise him about</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>matter:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>matter</em> is very general. It can refer to any kind of question or problem that the king might have had. In some languages it may be necessary to use a more specific expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>inquiry</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>subject/topic</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wisdom and understanding:</strong> The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as <em>wisdom and understanding</em> is literally “wisdom of understanding.” Most English versions connect the two nouns with the word <em>and</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> The Hebrew word for <em>wisdom</em> is the same word that is translated as “wisdom” in 1:4b. It is good to use the same word to indicate that the king found the qualities he was looking for.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>understanding:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>understanding</em> is the same as in 1:4b, in the phrase “quick to understand.” Other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>insight (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>balanced judgment (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about which the king consulted them:</strong> This clause expresses an action that the king repeated many times. He asked the four men many questions over a period of time. In some languages it may be necessary to make this more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Whenever the king asked them about things that required knowledge or insight… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No matter what question the king asked or what problem he raised… (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they proved/showed to him that they were many times wiser than all the magicians and religious/occult experts in his entire kingdom/empire.</p></li><li><p>and they always answered well/wisely, giving advice much/far better than that of all the experts in magic and pagan scholars in Babylonia.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom:</strong> The king judged or evaluated Daniel and his friends. He also judged or evaluated his own magicians and enchanters. Daniel and his friends proved to be <em>better</em> advisors. They were wiser, more capable, competent, and knowledgeable. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he found them ten times more capable than any of the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he found them:</strong> This introduces the results of the king’s evaluation. Languages have different ways to introduce this kind of information. In some languages it may be more natural to use a different verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king <u>realized</u> that they were….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he <u>saw</u> that they were</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they <u>showed themselves</u> to be</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they <u>proved</u> to be</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>them:</strong> The pronoun <em>them</em> refers to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>These four (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters:</strong> This expresses a comparison. It compares Daniel and his friends to all the magicians and enchanters. Specifically, the king compared their advice and their wisdom. In some languages it may be more natural to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king found <u>the advice</u> of these young men to be ten times better than that of all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he found <u>their wisdom</u> was ten times better than that of his other advisors and magicians (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>ten times better:</strong> Here <em>ten times</em> is used as a figure of speech. It is an emphatic way to say “very much better.” In some languages it may not be natural to use this figure of speech about a quality like wisdom that cannot be measured. If that is true in your language, there are several other possible ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Indicate that the four men knew ten times as much as the others. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>knew ten times more than… (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a different idiom to express the comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were head and neck above the others</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Express the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were much, much better/wiser</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>magicians:</strong> The same Hebrew word is used to describe the Egyptian magicians in the story of Joseph and Moses (Genesis 41:8; Exodus 7:11). It is good to use a word that refers to someone who predicts the future and has other unusual or supernatural powers. It should not indicate that these powers are from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most versions translate this in a general way as <em>magicians</em>. But it is also possible to translate more specifically, referring to what a magician in those days did. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fortuneteller (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>diviners</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dream interpreters</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>enchanters:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>enchanters</em> refers to people who know how to speak magical words (incantations, charms, or spells). Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>soothsayers (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>spell makers/speakers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in his entire kingdom:</strong> The word <em>kingdom</em> refers both to the country and the people that the king ruled. See “kingdom” in KBT.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:20</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">It may be natural to translate this as two or more separate sentences.

He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002003\"><h3>Paragraph 2:1–3</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph introduces the problem that is resolved in this section.

One way to explain this problem is to consider the way the Hebrews counted the years a king reigned. They counted the fraction of the first calendar year as a full year. Thus the second year according to the Babylonian way of counting would have been the third year according to the way the Hebrews counted. Baldwin (p. 85) explains that Nebuchadnezzar’s second year would have been March/April 603 BC. Others who take a similar view are Driver, Lucas, Showers, Wiseman, Walvoord. Wood, and Young.Goldingay explains that if this view is correct, then the “denouements in 1:18–20 and 2:45–49 might then refer to the same events.” This would solve a number of other apparent problems, including the fact that the king does not seem to know Daniel in chapter 2.</span></span> It was about the year 603 BC, when Nebuchadnezzar had been reigning more than a year but less than three years.

In the Hebrew text the name is explicit. See the General Comment on 2:1.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Nebuchadnezzar had dreams:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Nebuchadnezzar had dreams</em> is literally “Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams.” Use the idiom that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as Nebuchadnezzar <span data-bnType=\"implied\">lay in bed</span>, he dreamed.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was sleeping</span>, dreams came to him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> See how you spelled this name in 1:1b. In some languages it may be natural to include Nebuchadnezzar’s title here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dreams:</strong> In some languages there may be special words for certain types of dreams. Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams were of unusual and disturbing events. He thought they must have some supernatural meaning. Use the word or phrase that is natural to refer to such dreams. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>strange dreams</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB, following the Hebrew, uses the plural form <em>dreams</em>. However, the context focuses on one specific dream. Nebuchadnezzar perhaps dreamed the same dream several times. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had a series of dreams (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use a singular form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he had a dream (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Hebrew text the name “Nebuchadnezzar” is used twice in this verse part. In many languages it will be more natural to use a pronoun in one of these two references. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, <u>he</u> had a dream. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the second year of <u>his</u> reign Nebuchadnezzar was troubled by dreams. (REB)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that troubled his spirit, and sleep escaped him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that disturbed him. He could not sleep,</p></li><li><p>They made him so worried that he was unable to sleep.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Hebrew text this verse part connects to the previous verse part with the common connector that several English versions translate as “and.” In this context the connector introduces a result. The king’s dreams caused him to worry and not be able to sleep. Use a natural form in your language to express this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>dreamed such dreams that his spirit was troubled (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that troubled his spirit:</strong> The clause that the BSB translates as <em>that troubled his spirit</em> indicates that King Nebuchadnezzar felt anxious or worried. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his mind was troubled (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It worried him so much (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that bothered him (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he became very anxious</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his spirit:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>his spirit</em> here refers to Nebuchadnezzar’s thoughts and emotions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces the second result of the dream. Use a form that is natural in your language to express this idea.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sleep escaped him:</strong> The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as <em>sleep escaped him</em> probably indicates that Nebuchadnezzar was no longer able to sleep. It implies that the dream frightened Nebuchadnezzar so much that it woke him up. He could not go back to sleep again. Some ways to translate this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his sleep left him (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>kept him awake (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine the information in 2:1a and 2:1b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a-b</sup>One night during the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had such disturbing dreams that he could not sleep. (NLT)</p></blockquote></div>",

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002003\"><h3>Paragraph 2:1–3</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph introduces the problem that is resolved in this section. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was troubled by his dreams. He asked his advisers to explain them to him.</p></div><h4>2:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So the king gave orders to summon the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so he ordered the magicians, religious/occult experts, sorcerers, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> pagan experts</p></li><li><p>So he/Nebuchadnezzar commanded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his servants</span> to bring to him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">experts/advisers</span>, that is, the experts in magic, the pagan scholars, the enchanters, and the wizards.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> The Hebrew connector that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> here introduces a result clause. Use a form that naturally expresses this meaning in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the king gave orders to summon:</strong> The king gave orders to his servants to summon his advisers. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king sent for… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He called in… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to mention who the king commanded to summon the officers. If that is true in your language, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He commanded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his servants</span> to summon…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the king:</strong> This refers to King Nebuchadnezzar. Refer to him in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he summoned</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers:</strong> The author referred to these experts in two other lists in this chapter. The names vary in each list. This probably indicates that the lists are only giving examples of the various experts whom the king summoned.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lucas, p. 70; Goldingay, p. 46. Lucas explains that the author was not using the terms in order to give an exact list of those who came, but instead, he wanted to show the impressive group of people that Daniel had to compete with. Their failure gave even greater prominence to Daniel’s success.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages you may not have specific terms for each of the experts in this list. If you only have two or three terms, you may use those here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the magicians:</strong> See the Notes on “magicians” at Daniel 1:20b. Translate it here the way you did there. Either:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a general term for a person who uses the occult to determine the future or to learn secrets. Most English versions have <em>magicians</em>. However, in this context, the word “magician” does not have the modern meaning of someone who performs illusions or tricks for entertainment. Use a word that avoids this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>mages</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate this term more specifically, describing what the magicians did. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fortunetellers (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>dream interpreters<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ft Collins</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>diviners</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>enchanters:</strong> See the Notes on <em>enchanters</em> at 1:20b. These were men who were skilled at interpreting signs when people were sick. They were also skilled at performing rituals in order to influence people’s futures. The English word <em>enchanters</em> refers to people who cast a spell on someone by using a charm or magic (enchantment). Use an expression that communicates this idea as closely as possible. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>soothsayers<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A soothsayer is a person who claims to be able to foretell the future.</span></span> (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>witchdoctors</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sorcerers:</strong> This is the only place in Daniel where this term occurs. It refers to experts who were skilled in using charms and incantations. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wizards (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>astrologers:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>astrologers</em> is literally “Chaldeans.” This word has different meanings in Daniel, depending on the context (see 1:4d). In this context, the term refers to people who were experts in the occult and magical rites. They were people who were skilled at solving mysteries. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wizards (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wise men (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to introduce this list with a general expression like “The king summoned all the experts who interpreted dreams, including….” Some languages may prefer to list the four groups in a different order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>counselors, advisors, magicians, and wise men (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to explain his dreams.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to come and explain his dream.</p></li><li><p>He wanted them to tell him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the meaning of</span> his dream.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to explain his dreams:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to explain his dreams</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The king wanted the experts to interpret his dream. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to come and explain the dream to him (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NJB, NET, CEV, NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The king wanted the experts to tell him the content of his dream. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to tell the king his dreams (ESV) <em>(NIV, NASB, RSV/NRSV, ESV, NCV, NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must make a choice, it is recommended that you focus on option (1). Nebuchadnezzar wanted his advisers to tell him the meaning of his dream. He believed that it signified or warned of events that were to take place in the real world. Of course, interpreting the dream involved knowing what the dream was. It is probable that the king did in fact remember the dream but wanted to test his advisers.</p><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When they came and stood before the king,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>After they had arrived and stood before him,</p></li><li><p>And so they <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> entered the king’s presence.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When they came and stood before the king:</strong> The Hebrew text connects this verse part to the previous verse part with a common conjunction that many versions translate as “so.” Here it introduces what the king’s advisers did when they received his command to come: they came. Introduce this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>so</u> they came to the king (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They arrived and stood before the king. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As they stood before the king (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they came:</strong> The king’s advisers entered the king’s palace or court.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and stood before the king:</strong> The phrase <em>stood before</em> is an idiom that indicates that they approached someone who had higher status. In some languages there may be a different idiom that expresses this idea. If the idea is not clear from using an idiom, it may be best to leave it implicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So they came <u>to the king</u>. (GW)</p></blockquote>",

You should follow the form that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to understand it:</strong> The Hebrew text more literally says, “I have dreamed a dream and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.” Nebuchadnezzar was anxious to know the meaning or significance of a certain dream.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002004\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002004\"><h3>Paragraph 2:4</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The king’s advisers or dream experts responded to his command. In this verse the original text changes from the Hebrew language to the Aramaic language. This verse forms the transition. After 2:4a and until 7:28, the text is written in the Aramaic language.</p></div><h4>2:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then the advisers said to the king,</p></li><li><p>¶ The divination experts answered the king,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> The word <em>Then</em> in the BSB translates the common Hebrew connector <em>w-</em>. In this context it introduces the next event in the narrative. Introduce the next event in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the astrologers answered the king:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>astrologers</em> is literally “Chaldeans,” as in 2:2a. See the notes there. In this context it refers in general to all the dream experts and other advisers that the king had summoned to him. It is good to refer back to this group in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wise men (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the experts/advisers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Aramaic:</strong> These words are in Hebrew, like the rest of the text up to this point. But at this point there is a change and the source text from 2:4b until 7:28 is written in the Aramaic language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Hebrew text, this verse part contains a word meaning <em>in Aramaic</em>, that is, in the Aramaic language. Scholars disagree as to whether this word formed part of the original text of Daniel:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some scholars think that this word was not originally in the Hebrew text. They suggest that it is an editorial note added by scribes at a later time. It indicates that the text that follows (up to 7:28) is written in Aramaic, not Hebrew. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The wise men said to the king: [What follows is in Aramaic] (NET) <em>(NIV11, RSV, NJB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some scholars think that this word was part of the original text. The Hebrew text then indicates that the experts spoke to the king in the Aramaic language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Chaldeans, speaking in Aramaic, said (REB) <em>(BSB, NASB, KJV, ESV, NIV84, GW, GNT, NLT, CEV, NCV, REB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Option (1) is recommended. It is recommended that you do not translate the words <em>in Aramaic</em> in the text itself. Instead, you could put a footnote that reads something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>From this point until 7:28, the source text is written in the Aramaic language.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the discussion in the Introduction to the Notes. Aramaic was the common second language in the Ancient Near East at that time. Government officials especially used this language.</p><h4>2:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“O king, may you live forever!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Your Majesty, may you<sup>(sing)</sup> live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and rule</span> forever!</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Our<sup>(excl)</sup> King, we<sup>(excl)</sup> pray</span> that you<sup>(sing)</sup> will live forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O king, may you live forever!:</strong> The experts addressed the king with respect. Languages often have special ways to address a king or other important people in authority. Some examples in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty, may you live forever! (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May Your Majesty live forever! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Long live the king! (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May the king live forever! (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This was a common way people greeted the king. It is a figure of speech that means that they wished the king a long and healthy life. Express this meaning in a way that is natural in your language. See also 1 Kings 1:31.</p></blockquote><h4>2:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Tell your servants the dream,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> are your<sup>(sing)</sup> servants. Tell<sup>(sing)</sup> us<sup>(excl)</sup> your dream,</p></li><li><p>Please tell<sup>(sing)</sup> us<sup>(excl)</sup> what happened in your<sup>(sing)</sup> dream.</p></li><li><p>What happened in your<sup>(sing)</sup> dream, sir/master? Tell us<sup>(excl)</sup> that,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Tell your servants the dream:</strong> The advisers were speaking respectfully, requesting the king to tell them what he had dreamed. In some languages the imperative <em>Tell</em> may sound rude or too direct for speaking to the king. Express the request in a way that is polite in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are your servants. <u>Please</u> tell us your dream… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your servants:</strong> See the Notes at 1:12a. The experts referred to themselves in the third person. People spoke this way when they wanted to show respect to someone who had higher status. Your language may have other ways to show this. In some languages it may be necessary to use a first-person plural pronoun here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Tell <u>us</u> the dream (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>2:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and we will give the interpretation.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we<sup>(excl)</sup> will explain/reveal its meaning to you<sup>(sing)</sup>.”</p></li><li><p>Then we<sup>(excl)</sup> will tell you<sup>(sing)</sup> what it means.”</p></li><li><p>and we<sup>(excl)</sup> will tell/give you<sup>(sing)</sup> its interpretation.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and we will give the interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic text literally says “and we will show the interpretation.” This expression refers to revealing something that is not known or to interpreting something that is not understood. The dream experts told the king they would explain to him the meaning or significance of the details of his dream. Like Nebuchadnezzar, they believed that the gods sometimes revealed the future to people in dreams. Some ways to translate this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and we will reveal its meaning to you (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and we will tell you what it means (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> This refers to the advisers, experts, and dream interpreters in general (the “astrologers” from 2:2a). If your language distinguishes between <em>we</em> inclusive and <em>we</em> exclusive, you should use <em>we</em> exclusive here.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:4</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The dream experts indicated that they would tell the king the meaning of his dream if and when he told them what he had dreamed. They said this politely. In some languages it may be natural to say more directly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you tell us the dream, we will interpret it for you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When you tell us what you dreamed, we will tell you what it meant.</p></blockquote></div>",

Introduce Nebuchadnezzar’s response in the way that is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king declared</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king made this reply:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the astrologers:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the astrologers</em> is literally “the Chaldeans.” See the Notes on this same word at 2:4a. The term here again probably refers back to all the experts whom the king had summoned.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>My word is final:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>My word is final</em> is more literally “The word from me is sure,” as in the RSV. Scholars disagree as to the meaning of the word “sure” in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “certain,” that is, “decided.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word from me is firm (ESV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, RSV, ESV, REB, NET, GW, GNT, NLT, CEV, NCV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “proclaimed, decreed.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is a public decree (NRSV) <em>(KJV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the great majority of English versions. Nebuchadnezzar had made a definite decision about what to do. He was not just suggesting that his experts tell him the dream, he was requiring it.

Some ways to say it in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you do not tell me what my dream was… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must tell me the dream…If you do/can not</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Express the meaning in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tell:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>tell</em> means “inform, cause to know.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and its interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>its interpretation</em> is the same as in 2:4d. It refers to explaining how the dream would come true or be fulfilled.

The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002005\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002006\"><h3>Paragraph 2:5–6</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The king insisted that his expert advisers must both tell him what he had dreamed and interpret it for him.</p></div><h4>2:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if you tell me the dream and its interpretation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if you<sup>(plur)</sup> tell me what I dreamed and also explain what the dream means,</p></li><li><p>But if any/one of you<sup>(plur)</sup> tells me what I dreamed and what it means,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a contrast. In Daniel 2:5 the king threatened to punish the experts if they did not explain his dream. In 2:6 the king offered to reward them if they did explain it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you tell me the dream and its interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic text says more literally “if you declare/reveal the dream and its interpretation.” The indirect object <em>me</em> is implied. The king demanded that his advisers both tell him what he had dreamed and explain to him what it meant. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you can disclose the dream and its interpretation (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you can tell me both the dream and its meaning (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you tell me what I dreamed and what the dream means (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>if you tell:</strong> The Aramaic verb is plural here. The king was speaking to his advisers in general. But he was not expecting them to all reply together. So in some languages it may be more natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if any of you tell</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if one of you tells</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and its interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>and its interpretation</em> is the same Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as “and its interpretation” in 2:5b. See the note there. Some other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and what the dream means (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and its meaning (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will give you<sup>(plur)</sup> many wonderful gifts and I will give you<sup>(plur)</sup> great honor.</p></li><li><p>then I will richly reward him/you<sup>(sing)</sup> and honor him/you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with an important position in my kingdom</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor:</strong> The king promised that he would reward the experts for telling him his dream and its interpretation. In some languages it may be natural to focus on the king by making him the subject of the verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will give you many… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will reward you with… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gifts and rewards:</strong> These two words are close synonyms. Together they emphasize the quality and number of the gifts. If you have only one word or phrase in your language with this meaning, you can use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>many wonderful gifts (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will be richly rewarded by me (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>rewards:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>rewards</em> is in the singular, “a reward.” It is a rare word that is used only here and in Daniel 5:17. It seems to refer to something good that would be done or given to someone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and great honor:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>great honor</em> may refer to a high position or title. In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea with a verb and say that the king would honor the advisers who interpreted the dream. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and I will honor you</p></blockquote><h4>2:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So tell me the dream and its interpretation.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Now tell<sup>(plur)</sup> me what I have dreamed and what the dream means.”</p></li><li><p>So tell<sup>(plur)</sup> me what the dream was and what it means/signifies!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So tell me the dream and its interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> here introduces what the dream experts should do as a result of what the king had told them about rewards and punishments. Express this relationship in a way that is natural in your language. Possible models include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So tell me what the dream was about and reveal to me what it means.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now tell me the dream and explain what it means. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now then, tell me what the dream was and what it means. (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47.

It was almost but not exactly the same as their response in 2:4. It suggests there was increased tension between the experts and the king. The experts still hoped to influence the king to change what he had decided. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Once more they replied (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They answered the king again (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Once more they said (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king’s advisors repeated their answer</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be necessary to translate the words <em>a second time</em>, since this idea is implied by the context.

The king thought his advisers wanted to postpone answering him because they did not know what to say. Many languages will have idiomatic ways of saying this. In English there are several.

The experts realized that the king meant what he said about punishing them, and so they wanted to have more time to think what to say. In some languages you may have to add some implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you do not know the meaning of the dream</span> and</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you see that:</strong> Here the Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>you see</em> refers to understanding or perceiving something.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my word is final:</strong> This is the same expression that was used in 2:5a.

For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002007\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002009\"><h3>Paragraph 2:7–9</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The dream experts repeated their request that the king tell them his dream, and the king repeated his demand that they explain its meaning.</p></div><h4>2:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If you do not tell me the dream,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not tell me what I dreamed,</p></li><li><p>If you<sup>(plur)</sup> fail to tell me what my dream was,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If you do not tell me the dream:</strong> This is a negative conditional clause, suggesting that something might not happen.

If they could not tell him his dream, he would punish them all in the same way. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is only one thing that is going to happen to you (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there is but one sentence for you (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will all receive the same punishment</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>decree:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>decree</em> literally means “law.” This “law” refers to the decree that the king made in 2:5b about punishing his advisers. Some ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>verdict (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>punishment (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to express this abstract idea using a verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have made up my mind <sup>9b</sup>to give all of you the same punishment <sup>9a</sup>if you don’t tell me the dream.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have agreed among yourselves to make up a phony explanation to give me (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You have conspired:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>conspired</em> here means to agree secretly together to do something wrong. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have agreed among yourselves (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have planned/plotted</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You’ve decided (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to speak before me false and fraudulent words:</strong> The king accused his advisers of continuing to lie to him. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to go on telling me lies (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>false and fraudulent words:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that BSB translates as <em>false and fraudulent words</em> is more literally “a false and corrupt word.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>lying and corrupt words (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>misleading and wicked things (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>lying and misleading (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context <em>false</em> and <em>fraudulent</em> have similar meanings. In some languages it is most natural to use one word or phrase to express this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a bunch of lies (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a phony explanation (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>2:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>hoping the situation will change.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>hoping that something will change/happen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to save you</span>.</p></li><li><p>in the hope that I would change the decree.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hoping the situation will change:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>situation</em> is more literally “time.” Here it refers to a possible time in the future when the king might be willing to change what he decreed. Or it might refer to a time when a new king would reign, and it would be an indication of Nebuchadnezzar’s death. But it is best not to make this explicit. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>till the times change (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hoping that things will change (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because you hope that in time the situation will change</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are hoping that eventually the decree will fail/cease.</p></blockquote><h4>2:9e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore tell me the dream,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So tell<sup>(plur)</sup> me now what I dreamed.</p></li><li><p>Therefore tell<sup>(plur)</sup> me what happened in my dream.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore tell me the dream:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>Therefore</em> here introduces what the advisers should do as a result of what the king has just said. It implies that the king does not want any more delay. English versions have different ways of expressing this.</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions use a connector that introduces the result clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So then tell me the dream (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some versions do not use an explicit connector. The result relation is left implied from the context. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Tell me what the dream was (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tell me the dream:</strong> This instruction implies that the experts should tell the king what he had dreamed. It does not refer only to the interpretation of the dream. See the note on 2:6c.</p><h4>2:9f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I will know that you can give me its interpretation.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then I will know that you<sup>(plur)</sup> can explain what it means.”</p></li><li><p>That will prove to me that you<sup>(plur)</sup> can interpret what it means.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces a result clause. If the dream experts could tell Nebuchadnezzar what he had dreamed, he would believe that they had supernatural help or wisdom. Then he would trust that they could give him a correct interpretation. Introduce the result clause in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and then (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will know that you can give me its interpretation:</strong> There is some implied information here. Nebuchadnezzar understood that his experts could tell him his dream only if they had supernatural knowledge. Telling him his dream would prove they were genuine magicians, fortunetellers, or sorcerers. He would then be able to trust that their interpretation was reliable, not just something they had made up themselves. The following are some ways to translate this sentence in English:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I’ll know that you can explain its meaning to me (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will know that you can also tell me what it means (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that will show me that you are able to interpret it for me</p></blockquote>",

See the Notes at 2:4a and translate it as you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>answered the king:</strong> See the Notes at 2:5a. In this context the Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates <em>answered the king</em> introduces a response that disagrees with someone of higher status. Use an appropriate expression in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>responded to the king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>asserted</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>objected to the king’s command</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>No one on earth can do what the king requests!:</strong> This is an emphatic way for the advisers to say that they could not do what the king asked. They thought that it was impossible for anyone to do it. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one on earth can tell the king what he asks. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no human being can fulfill your Majesty’s request</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no one on earth who can reveal what the king demands! (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>No one on earth:</strong> The phrase <em>No one on earth</em> means “nobody at all.” No human being could know what someone else had dreamed about. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nobody in the world (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>can do what the king requests:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>can do what the king requests</em> is literally “who will be able to tell the king’s matter/thing.” This refers to the king’s problem or question concerning what he saw in his dream. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>can tell the king his dream (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the king:</strong> Again the experts addressed the king in the third person to show respect. In some languages it may be more natural to address him with second-person pronouns like “you” and “your.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>There is no one on the face of the earth who can tell Your Majesty what you want to know. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Your Majesty, you are demanding the impossible!

The BSB leaves this connector untranslated, since it is implied by the context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>No king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer:</strong> The royal advisers protested to the king that his demand was unprecedented. That is, no king had ever made such a demand before. The implication is that the king should not expect to have his demand fulfilled. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No other king, no matter how great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, psychic, or astrologer (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No king, not even the most famous and powerful, has ever ordered his advisors, magicians, or wise men to do such a thing (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No great and powerful king has ever asked the fortune-tellers, magicians, or wise men to do this. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>No king, however great and powerful:</strong> There are two ways to understand the Aramaic words that the BSB translates as <em>No king, however great and powerful</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The words <em>great</em> and <em>powerful</em> function as adjectives describing the king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no great and powerful king (ESV) <em>(BSB, ESV, NIV, RSV/NRSV, NET, GW, NCV, CEV, REB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The words <em>great</em> and <em>powerful</em> are titles referring to other rulers: “the great one,” “the mighty one.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no other king, governor or chief (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no great king or ruler (NASB) <em>(NASB, NJB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>No king:</strong> The royal advisers were saying that Nebuchadnezzar was the only king to have made such a request. In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>No other king (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>however great and powerful:</strong> The words <em>great</em> and <em>powerful</em> mean much the same thing in this context. They refer to a man with power over others. The advisers implied that Nebuchadnezzar was a <em>great</em> and <em>powerful</em> king. They were suggesting that he should behave like other great kings and not make such demands of his advisers. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>regardless of his position and power (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>not even the most famous and powerful (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>not even the greatest and most powerful (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>any magician, enchanter, or astrologer:</strong> This list of experts is not the same as the list in 2:2a, where there is a fourth term, “sorcerer.” These names may be simply examples of the various kinds of experts whom the king summoned. You could begin the list with a general phrase. For example, “any of his experts, such as….” In some languages there may be only one or two terms to express this category. You may wish to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>any of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> various wise men</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use plural forms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has ever asked the fortune-tellers, magicians, or wise men to do this (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>magician:</strong> See the Notes at 2:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>enchanter:</strong> See the Notes at 2:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>astrologer:</strong> See the Notes at 2:2a.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:10b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as two shorter, positive sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Many great and mighty kings have ruled. You are the only one to have made such a demand of his magicians, enchanters, and wise men!</p></blockquote></div>",

For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002010\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002011\"><h3>Paragraph 2:10–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The king’s experts and advisers all assured the king that his demand was impossible. Nobody could tell the king his dream. Only a god could do that.</p></div><h4>2:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>What the king requests is so difficult</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Your Majesty, you<sup>(sing)</sup> have asked us<sup>(excl)</sup> to do something that is too difficult/hard.</p></li><li><p>Sir, what you<sup>(sing)</sup> have asked is beyond our ability.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">To explain your<sup>(sing)</sup> dream without hearing it first</span> is impossible—</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>What the king requests is so difficult:</strong> The royal advisers again addressed the king in the third person to show respect. This may not be natural in your language. Another possibility is to use the second-person pronoun and a polite form of address. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What you ask is too difficult, Your Majesty (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sir, what you<sup>(sing)</sup> have asked us to do is too difficult.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>so difficult:</strong> In this context the Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>so difficult</em> means “impossible.” Some ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>too hard (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>impossible thing (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>can’t be done (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that no one can tell it to him except the gods,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Only the gods can reveal to you<sup>(sing)</sup> what you dreamed,</p></li><li><p>Only the divine beings can reveal this dream to you<sup>(sing)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>except for divine beings,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no one can tell it to him except the gods:</strong> The advisers explained what they meant by saying the king’s command was “so difficult.” It was impossible for them to obey because no one could reveal the king’s dream to him. They could not know what he had dreamed unless he told them. They continued to address the king respectfully in the third person. Here are some different ways to translate this clause in English:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no one can find the king an answer to it, except the gods (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sir, no one is able to do what you have asked. The gods alone can do it.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no one but the gods capable of revealing this thing to you, Your Majesty.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to make explicit the reference of the pronoun <em>it</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no one can tell you what you dreamed (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one except the gods can tell you your dream (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>no one can tell…except the gods:</strong> The phrase <em>no one</em> here in the BSB includes both human and divine persons, as the phrase <em>except the gods</em> makes clear. In some languages it may be natural or necessary to exclude <em>the gods</em> from phrase <em>no one</em> and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No human can…. Only the gods can….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>except the gods:</strong> The phrase <em>the gods</em> here refers to the false deities that the Babylonians worshiped. In some languages you may have to use a different word for <em>gods</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>divine beings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>spirits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the ones/beings we worship</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:11b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a positive statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Only the gods could tell the king this. (NCV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whose dwelling is not with mortals.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they do not live among us<sup>(incl)</sup> human beings.</p></li><li><p>Those beings do not stay with mere people like us<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that we<sup>(excl)</sup> could consult them</span>.”</p></li><li><p>who are very far from us<sup>(incl)</sup> human beings.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whose dwelling is not with mortals:</strong> This verse part indicates that the gods do not live on earth, among human beings. The experts were implying that the gods were so distant that they could not consult them about the dream. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whose dwelling is not with flesh (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and they do not live here on earth with us<sup>(incl)</sup></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mortals:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mortals</em> is more literally “flesh.” It emphasizes the weakness of human beings. Humans eventually die. Some ways to express this emphasis in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with humans (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>among mere human beings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>among mortal men</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use a first-person pronoun.

It refers to what the experts said in 2:11, and the BSB has supplied the word <em>response</em> to indicate that.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>so furious with anger:</strong> The author used two different words to describe how the king felt: the Aramaic says literally “furious and angry.” The two words are similar in meaning. Together they emphasize that the king was extremely angry, and so the BSB translates them together as a phrase, <em>furious with anger</em>. The word <em>so</em> further indicates the intensity of his anger.

The Aramaic is more literally “and he said to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.” The subject of the verb <em>destroy</em> is not mentioned. There are several ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using an active verb with no subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb with the subject explicit.

The king’s anger was so great or intense that he gave this command. In some languages this may be implied by a different connector. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he gave orders:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>gave orders</em> is literally “said.” The context implies the meaning “order, command.” In some languages it may be necessary to say to whom the king was speaking or giving the order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he commanded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his men</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to destroy:</strong> The wise men were to be killed. The method by which they were to be put to death is not mentioned. It is probable that they were to die by being cut by swords.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all the wise men of Babylon:</strong> This refers to the same group of expert advisers who were mentioned in 2:2a and in 2:10b. It is a general term that includes all of the experts in general. They were professionals who worked as advisers for the king, not ordinary men with special wisdom. Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>royal advisers (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Babylonian sages (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> This name can refer to either the city or the kingdom.

The BSB has supplied the information that it was <em>men</em> who <em>went to look for</em> them. The king ordered some of his men to find out where Daniel and his friends were. Some versions use a passive verb that puts the focus on these men. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use an active verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and the king sent <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some men</span> to find Daniel and his friends</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king ordered a search</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>men:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to be say who these <em>men</em> were. If that is true in your language, you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the king’s men/soldiers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Daniel and his friends:</strong> There is some implied information here: Daniel and his friends were among the wise men, the advisers to the king. That is why the king’s men were looking for them. They were going to kill them along with all the other advisers. In some languages it may be necessary to make this information explicit in order to avoid confusion. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Daniel and his companions <span data-bnType=\"implied\">were wise men/advisers</span>, and so the king’s men went to look for them and kill them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>his friends:</strong> This refers to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002014\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002016\"><h3>Paragraph 2:14–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel was able to persuade the king to delay the executions and give him time to interpret the dream.</p></div><h4>2:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Arioch, who was in charge of the king’s guard, set out to execute the Babylonian sages/advisers.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">At that time</span> the captain of the king’s guards <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was a man named</span> Arioch.

It indicates an important action and introduces a conversation that changes the narrative. Embedded in this clause is some background information, the name and position of the man in charge of the execution. In view of all this, in some languages it may be natural to translate this verse part using an independent clause or clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Arioch, the commander of the king’s guard, was going to kill the wise men of Babylon. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Arioch was the king’s official in charge of putting the wise men to death. He was on his way to have it done, when… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the commander of the king’s guard:</strong> Arioch was in charge of a group of men, <em>the king’s guard</em>. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>guard</em> comes from a word meaning “kill.” One of the responsibilities of the men in the <em>guard</em> was to execute criminals and enemies. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who was in charge of the king’s executioners (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The <em>guard</em> probably had other responsibilities as well, such as protecting the king. Most English translations therefore use the more general expression <em>guard</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the king’s guard:</strong> The English word <em>guard</em> is a collective noun. It is singular in form but refers to a group of men.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon:</strong> This clause probably indicates that Arioch had left the king’s presence and was preparing to kill the wise men. He was on his journey to find them but had probably not started killing them yet. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>set out to execute the wise men of Babylon (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was leaving to kill the wise advisers in Babylon (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was on his way to kill the Babylonian sages (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the wise men of Babylon:</strong> The phrase <em>the wise men of Babylon</em> refers in general to the king’s advisers and practitioners of divination. It includes all the experts who were mentioned in 2:2. See the Notes at 2:12b.</p><h4>2:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Daniel replied with discretion and tact.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Daniel spoke to him with sensible, tactful words.</p></li><li><p>Daniel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">met him and</span> spoke to him wisely,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel replied with discretion and tact:</strong> The Aramaic text is more literally “Daniel returned counsel and prudence to Arioch.” It indicates that Daniel spoke to Arioch in a way that would not anger him and was wise in that situation. There are two ways to interpret and translate the phrase <em>with discretion and tact</em> in this context:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as two similar ideas. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with wisdom and skill (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with prudence and discretion (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as one idea, indicating that Daniel’s reply was characterized by “prudent counsel” or “tactful wisdom.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He spoke to him using shrewd judgment (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this in the way that is most natural in your language.

There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002014\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002016\"><h3>Paragraph 2:14–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel was able to persuade the king to delay the executions and give him time to interpret the dream.</p></div><h4>2:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him some time,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then Daniel went in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to talk</span> to the king.

In some languages no connector may be needed. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a form in your language that naturally indicates the next event in a sequence.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Daniel went in and asked the king:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates <em>went in and asked</em> here indicates that Daniel went to see the king to talk to him. He officially entered the king’s presence. If you have a way of referring to going to see an important person, you may use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>asked the king to give him some time:</strong> Scholars have interpreted this clause differently:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The clause means that Daniel asked the king to allow him <u>more time</u> so that he could interpret the dream. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>requested more time (NLT) <em>(BSB, NJB, NIV, KJV, NRSV, REB, GW, GNT, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The clause means that Daniel asked the king for <u>an appointment time</u>, when he would tell the king about his dream. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>asked for an appointment (NCV) <em>(NCV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions are ambiguous (NASB, KJV, NET). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Daniel was asking for <u>more</u> time to explain the dream.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>asked the king to give him some time (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to ask the king for a stay of execution (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is implied from the following context that the king agreed to Daniel’s request.

Daniel asked for a longer period of time so that he could interpret the dream for the king. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that he could tell the king what the dream meant (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that he could explain the dream’s meaning (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he could give him the interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>give</em> is literally “show.” The word that the BSB translates as <em>interpretation</em> refers to the meaning of the dream. The implication is that Daniel would be able to show the king the meaning of his dream by revelation, that is, by supernatural means. See the Notes at 2:6a, 2:9a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to include the implied information that the king agreed to Daniel’s request.

Daniel told his friends what he wanted them to do: to pray and ask God for mercy. Other translations supply this information in different ways (underlined):</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>He urged them</u> to plead for mercy from the God of heaven (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>He asked them</u> to pray for mercy from the God of heaven (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>He told them</u> to ask the God of heaven to be merciful (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be most natural to use direct speech here. See the General Comment on 2:18. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Then he said</u>, “Pray that the God who rules from heaven will be merciful…” (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> refers to feelings and actions of compassion, kindness, and pity. Daniel wanted his friends to ask God to be kind to them and help them by revealing to them the king’s dream. This would save their lives. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the noun <em>mercy</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He urged them to pray that the God of heaven <u>would be merciful</u> to them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the God of heaven:</strong> The phrase <em>the God of heaven</em> means “the God who is/lives in heaven.” This is a title for the one true God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This title for God is also found in Genesis 24:7 and the longer form “the God of heaven and earth” in Genesis 24:3.</span></span> The Babylonian experts believed that people did not have direct contact with gods. See 2:11b. Daniel, however, believed that the one true God did reveal things directly to men on earth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation of <em>the God of heaven</em> may imply or suggest that there is another God who is not in heaven. It is important to translate in a way that avoids this implication. There is only one God, and he dwells and reigns in heaven. It may be possible to avoid the wrong meaning by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, the one who is in heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to expand the title <em>God of heaven</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who rules from heaven (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>heaven</em> here refers to the place where God lives and reigns. See “heaven, sky” in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>concerning this mystery:</strong> Daniel and his companions wanted God to help them know what the king had dreamed and what the dream meant. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Pray that the God who rules from heaven will be merciful <u>and explain this mystery</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He urged them to ask the God of heaven to show them his mercy <u>by telling them</u> the secret (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mystery:</strong> The Bible uses this word only in the book of Daniel. The <em>mystery</em> refers to both the dream and its interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 89) believes that the king forgot the dream, so that the mystery includes both the dream and the interpretation. The UBS Handbook interprets the mystery as referring only to the interpretation.</span></span> In this context the <em>mystery</em> was something that only God could reveal. Be careful not to use a word that is related to local pagan religions. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>secret (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king</span> would not have them put to death with the other advisers/sages of Babylon.</p></li><li><p>so that they would not die along with the king’s other experts.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed:</strong> Daniel wanted his friends to pray that God would show him mercy by revealing to him the king’s dream. Then he and his friends would not be executed. This was the result that Daniel desired and hoped for.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>so that:</strong> The Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> here introduces the final result that Daniel wanted. If God showed mercy and revealed the dream, then the Hebrew youths would not die.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Daniel and his friends would not be killed:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>Daniel and his friends would not be killed</em> is more literally “they (indefinite) might not kill Daniel and his companions.” The subject is indefinite. There are several ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using an active verb and making the subject explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king</span> might not have him and his friends put to death</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king’s men/soldiers</span> might not execute him and his friends</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Making Daniel and his friends the subject of an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel and his companions might not perish (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he and his friends would not be killed (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the verb form that is most natural in your language in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the rest of the wise men of Babylon:</strong> It is not clear whether at this point Daniel was trying to save just himself and his three friends or all of the wise men. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Daniel was praying that the king would spare him and his friends. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that Daniel and his friends might be spared the fate of the other Babylonian sages (NJB) <em>(BSB, KJV, NJB, NASB, RSV, ESV, NIV, REB, NJB, NET, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Daniel prayed that the king would spare him, his friends, and all the rest of the wise men. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that we and the others won’t be put to death (CEV) <em>(CEV, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to leave this ambiguous if possible. However, if it is necessary to choose between the interpretations, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wise men:</strong> See the Notes at 2:12, where the same word is used. Daniel was referring to the group of divination experts who advised the king. This included all the various groups of experts listed in 2:2a. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>other advisers (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wise advisers (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sages (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:18</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate what Daniel said to his friends as direct speech.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002019\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002023\"><h3>Paragraph 2:19–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">God revealed to Daniel what the king had dreamed and what the dream meant. Daniel expressed his thanks to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author has recorded Daniel’s prayer of thanks in poetic form. Some translations (for example, the NJB) indicate this by the way they print the lines. You may have a special way of writing poetic speech in your language. If so, you may use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In his prayer of thanks, Daniel first refers to God in the third person (using the pronouns “he/him”). Then in 2:23 he switches to the second person (that is, using the pronoun “you”). In some languages this change may be unnatural. See the General Comment on 2:20–22.</p></div><h4>2:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ In the night Daniel received a vision that explained the mystery.</p></li><li><p>¶ During the night <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> revealed the secret to Daniel in a vision.</p></li><li><p>¶ While Daniel was sleeping, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> caused him to have a dream and explained to him the mystery <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the king’s dream</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">2:19a connects to the previous verse part with a conjunction that most English versions translate as “Then.” It introduces what happened next. The BSB does not explicitly translate this conjunction. Introduce what happened next in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>During the night, the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>During the night…in a vision</em> is more literally “in a vision of the night,” as in the RSV. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in a night vision (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>During the night:</strong> It is not clear on exactly what night this happened. The text does not explicitly state that it was that same night, but it might have been. It is good to leave this possibility open.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the mystery was revealed to Daniel:</strong> Here the verb is passive, and there are at least two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a night-vision (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. You may need to supply the subject, God. God was the one who revealed the dream to Daniel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God explained the secret to Daniel (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the mystery:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the mystery</em> is the same as was used in 2:18a. It refers to the same thing, the dream and its interpretation. See the Notes there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in a vision:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>vision</em> is different from the one for “dream” in 2:4c and the following verses. However, in this chapter, the author seems to use the two words in a similar way. The context implies that these were not ordinary dreams. They came from God and revealed a secret that only he could reveal. As a result, most English versions have “vision” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there may not be different expressions to refer to ordinary dreams and visions. If that is true in your language, you may be able to use an expression such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in a dream from God</p></blockquote><h4>2:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he blessed the God of heaven</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So Daniel blessed God who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is/lives</span> in heaven,</p></li><li><p>Then Daniel praised God, the one who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">rules</span> from heaven.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part indicates Daniel’s response to God for revealing the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and he blessed the God of heaven:</strong> To “bless” God is to express honor, praise, and thanks to him. See how you translated this idea in Genesis 9:26, Psalm 66:8, 103:1, and Romans 9:5. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then Daniel praised the God of heaven (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then Daniel said good things about the God of heaven<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ft <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em></span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the God of heaven:</strong> This is the same title that was used in 2:18a. It means “the God who dwells/lives in heaven” or “the God who rules from heaven.” It refers to the one true God and does not suggest there is another God living or ruling somewhere else. See the note at 2:18a. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who rules from heaven (CEV)</p></blockquote>",

See the Notes at 2:5a and 2:10a. This introduces the content of Daniel’s prayer of thanks, what he said when he “blessed” God (see 2:19b). Versions such as the GNT and CEV leave these words untranslated and implied by the context. Introduce Daniel’s prayer in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>saying,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This was his prayer:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in these words</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Blessed be the name of God forever and ever:</strong> Daniel called for God to receive praises throughout eternity. See how you translated the similar expressions in Job 1:21 and Psalm 113:2. Daniel was honoring and thanking God for revealing to him the king’s dream. He did not mention himself, but his call for God to receive praise functions as praise. He declared God to be worthy of praise.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Blessed be:</strong> See the Notes at 2:19b. The Aramaic verb is passive. If it is more natural to use an active form, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May people praise…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everyone should praise…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let us<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Whether an inclusive or an exclusive pronoun is used may depend on how God is addressed in this prayer. If you translate “the name of God” using a second-person pronoun (“you”), an exclusive pronoun will be necessary here.</span></span> praise…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the name of God:</strong> Daniel used the phrase <em>the name of God</em> to refer to God himself. This was a common Hebrew idiom.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It was also a respectful way that Jewish people referred to God’s personal name Yahweh. Daniel may have used this expression in order to avoid saying God’s name in a careless or offensive way. See the discussion by Goldingay (p. 46).</span></span> See Deuteronomy 12:5; Psalm 97:12, 115:1, 138:2. Because it is a well-known idiom from the Bible, many English versions translate the phrase literally. In some languages, however, it may be unnatural and even confusing to translate the idiom literally. If that is true in your language, you may translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Praise <u>God</u> forever and ever (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let us<sup>(incl)</sup> thank/bless <u>God</u> at all times</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is unnatural or confusing to address a prayer to God in the third person. See the General Comment on 2:20–22. If it is natural to use the second person here, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our God, your name will be praised forever and forever. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Blessed/Praised for all eternity are you, O God!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forever and ever:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>forever and ever</em> refers to limitless time, both past and future. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from age to age (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>throughout time and eternity</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let/may…never stop</p></blockquote><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for wisdom and power belong to Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Wisdom and power belong to him.</p></li><li><p>God is the source of all wisdom and power.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> know everything and you<sup>(sing)</sup> are the most powerful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for wisdom and power belong to Him:</strong> This part of the verse gives the basis for Daniel’s call to praise God: God was wise and powerful. The Aramaic text introduces this verse part with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>for</em>. Some versions have not explicitly translated it, but you may do so if it is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>for</u> to him belong wisdom and power (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>since</u> wisdom and power are his alone (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a person cannot own abstract qualities like <em>wisdom</em> and <em>power</em>. If this is true in your language, you may translate the meaning directly, using adjectives or verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because he is wise and powerful (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are all-powerful and you know everything. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> Daniel was referring to the understanding and insight that God has and can give a person. See the Notes at 1:4b and 1:17a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>power:</strong> In this context, the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>power</em> refers to the ability to do great things. Daniel was thinking not only of God’s power to reveal dreams, but also of his power over the events of history and over creation.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:20a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">2:20b gives the reason why people are to praise God forever (2:20a). In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of these two verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20c</sup>God is wise and powerful!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20b</sup>Praise him forever and ever. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In other languages it may be natural to follow a verb like “blessed” with a direct quotation, stating the content of the praise. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20b</sup>Let us bless the name of God for ever and ever,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20c</sup>saying, “God is wise and powerful!….”</p></blockquote></div>",

In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002019\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002023\"><h3>Paragraph 2:19–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">God revealed to Daniel what the king had dreamed and what the dream meant. Daniel expressed his thanks to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author has recorded Daniel’s prayer of thanks in poetic form. Some translations (for example, the NJB) indicate this by the way they print the lines. You may have a special way of writing poetic speech in your language. If so, you may use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In his prayer of thanks, Daniel first refers to God in the third person (using the pronouns “he/him”). Then in 2:23 he switches to the second person (that is, using the pronoun “you”). In some languages this change may be unnatural. See the General Comment on 2:20–22.</p></div><h4>2:21a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Biblical authors often wrote poetry in pairs of related lines. Daniel 2:21a and 2:21b form one of these pairs. They are closely related in that 2:21a gives a general principle and 2:21b gives an example of how that principle works out in history. If you are writing Daniel’s prayer as poetry, you may wish to print these lines as a couplet, in two lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He controls the times and the seasons;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He makes and unmakes kings (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He determines the course of world events;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he removes kings and sets up other kings. (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:21a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He changes the times and seasons;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He causes times and seasons to change.</p></li><li><p>It is you<sup>(sing)</sup> who causes the times and the seasons to change <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each year</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He changes the times and seasons:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>changes</em> here indicates that God can alter world history. He has power over all that happens, the different eras and ages of the world, and the various empires that rise and fall. Daniel was praising God for his control over time and history. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He controls the times and the seasons (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He determines the course of world events (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He:</strong> Daniel referred to God in the third person in order to show respect. However, this may not be natural in your language. If you used the second person at the beginning of the prayer in 2:20, you should use it again here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>times and seasons:</strong> The two words <em>times</em> and <em>seasons</em> are very close in meaning here. They probably refer to the times and seasons of history, that is, the ages or eras when different nations and rulers have power. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>times and periods of history (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to combine the two words <em>times</em> and <em>seasons</em> into one idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the course of world events (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human events (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He removes kings and establishes them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He takes away the power of kings and gives that power to others.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> cause certain kings to rule and you<sup>(sing)</sup> cause other kings to stop ruling.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He removes kings and establishes them:</strong> This verse part tells one way that God displays his control over human history. He causes some people to become kings and some kings he causes to stop ruling. He is in control of those events. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>deposing some kings and establishing others (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he removes kings and sets up other kings. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He removes kings:</strong> Cultures have different ways to describe how people remove their kings from that powerful position. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He takes away the power of kings (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he takes away their royal thrones/crowns</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>establishes them:</strong> Cultures also have different ways to speak of how a person becomes a king. Use a verb in your language that means, “to cause to rule.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>raises up others (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gives their power to new kings (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>puts others on the throne</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>them:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>them</em> is literally “kings,” as in the first clause, “He removes kings.” It refers to different men, men whom God causes to become kings. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>other kings (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:21b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of the two clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you give rulers their power and take it away (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he makes and unmakes kings (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He is the one who gives wise people their wisdom. He is the one who causes intelligent people to understand matters.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> make people wise and you<sup>(sing)</sup> help them to understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">difficult things</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning:</strong> The two parts of this verse part are in poetic parallelism. The second line repeats the meaning of the first line in a different way. It is good to show this by translating them as a couplet. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He gives wisdom to the wise;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he imparts knowledge to those who have understanding. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He gives wisdom to the wise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and knowledge to those who have insight. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If someone/anyone is wise, it is you who gave them their wisdom.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If someone/anyone is discerning, it is you who gave them their discernment.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He gives wisdom to the wise:</strong> If a person is wise, that wisdom has come from the Lord. This is very similar to the idea in 2:20. See the Notes at 2:20b. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He gives the wise <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> wisdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Wise people receive <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> wisdom from you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And you are the source of wisdom (CEV)</p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Some languages may not have an abstract word that means <em>wisdom</em>. You may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are the one who makes a person wise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You make people wise</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the wise:</strong> The phrase <em>the wise</em> here refers to people who know things others do not know, who give good advice, and who know how to make good decisions. They are not the same as the professional “wise men” of 2:12–14. Refer to these people in the way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>those who are wise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>wise people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>someone wise</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and knowledge to the discerning:</strong> The phrase <em>and knowledge to the discerning</em> is short for “and he/God gives knowledge to the discerning.” If someone is knowledgeable or quick to learn and understand, it is God who has given them that ability. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you give discerning people their ability to discern</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is you who gives knowledgeable men their understanding</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>knowledge:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>knowledge</em> can refer to the ability to gain knowledge, the power of knowing.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the <em>Hebrew-English Lexicon</em> by Brown, Driver, and Briggs, p. 1095.</span></span> In some languages, there may not be an abstract word that means <em>knowledge</em>. It may be more natural to use a verb, such as “cause to understand.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>and you make people understand things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>and you help people to discern things</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the discerning:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the discerning</em> is more literally “the knowers of understanding.” Here it probably refers to people who understand things easily and know many things. In this context it means much the same as “the wise.” Your language may have a special name for people such as this. The following are some English examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>those who have understanding (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>those who have insight (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the scholars (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002019\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002023\"><h3>Paragraph 2:19–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">God revealed to Daniel what the king had dreamed and what the dream meant. Daniel expressed his thanks to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author has recorded Daniel’s prayer of thanks in poetic form. Some translations (for example, the NJB) indicate this by the way they print the lines. You may have a special way of writing poetic speech in your language. If so, you may use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In his prayer of thanks, Daniel first refers to God in the third person (using the pronouns “he/him”).

See the General Comment on 2:20–22.</p></div><h4>2:22</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:22 Daniel uses figurative language. If you have the same figures of speech, you can use them here. If you do not, you may use a different figure or simply translate the meaning.</p><h4>2:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He reveals the deep and hidden things;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He reveals mysteries and explains things that are hard to understand.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> explain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span> even the most secret mysteries.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He reveals the deep and hidden things:</strong> This is figurative language. It indicates that God reveals mysteries and secrets, things that people cannot know by themselves. The king’s dream was an example of one such <em>deep and hidden</em> thing. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who uncovers depths and mysteries (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He makes known secrets that are deep and hidden (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reveals:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>reveals</em> means to uncover or show something concealed or unknown. It is a different form of the verb “was revealed” that was used in 2:19a. See the note there. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>explain (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>makes known (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a verb like <em>reveals</em> may require an indirect object to indicate to whom the things are revealed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he reveals deep and mysterious things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deep and hidden things:</strong> The two adjectives <em>deep</em> and <em>hidden</em> overlap in meaning, and they are both used in figurative ways. In some languages it may be more natural to combine the ideas in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>deep mysteries (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the most mysterious secrets</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>deep:</strong> In this verse Daniel used the word <em>deep</em> in a figurative way to refer to things that are hard to understand. The word <em>deep</em> may not have this figurative meaning in your language. Use an expression that is clear in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>matters that are hard to understand</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>hidden:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates literally as <em>hidden</em> is used figuratively here. It means “secret things” or “mysteries,” referring to such things as the king’s dream that people could not know naturally. Other English versions have:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>mysterious (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>secret (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>hidden</em> may not have this figurative meaning in your language. If you have another expression that has this meaning, you may use it here. For example, you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>matters that are beyond human understanding</p></blockquote><h4>2:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He knows what lies in darkness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He knows what is hidden in dark places.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> know/see everything that humans cannot know/see.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He knows what lies in darkness:</strong> Daniel continued to praise God, saying that he knows things that are impossible for human beings to know. Darkness does not hide anything from him. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[He] sees in the dark<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Message</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what lies in darkness:</strong> Daniel used the word <em>darkness</em> in a figurative way. The phrase <em>what lies in darkness</em> not only refers to what is difficult for our eyes to see but also to what is difficult for our minds to understand and interpret. It does not refer to a specific thing or a specific dark place.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to indicate in some way that the language is figurative or even to translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he knows what is hidden in darkness (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he knows what lies hidden in darkness (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he fully understands what is a mystery to humans</p></blockquote><h4>2:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and light dwells with Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>With him is light.</p></li><li><p>With you<sup>(sing)</sup> there is light.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> are the one who causes people to understand what they could not know by themselves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces a continuation and expansion of the previous thought.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>light dwells with Him:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates literally as <em>light dwells with Him</em> means that where God is, there is light. This is a metaphor. Just as light reveals things and makes them clear, so God reveals secrets and mysteries and makes their meaning clear. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he himself is surrounded by light (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>light is all around him (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to use <em>light</em> in this figurative way. If that is true in your language, you may have to indicate the meaning in some way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with him is the light <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of truth</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:20–22</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:20–22, Daniel referred to God in the third person. This was a way Jewish people showed respect to God. If this is unnatural in your language, you can translate the prayer using second-person pronouns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20a</sup>Our God, your name will be praised forever and forever.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20b</sup>You are all-powerful and you know everything.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>21a</sup>You control human events—</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>21b</sup>You give rulers their power and take it away,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>21c</sup>and you are the source of wisdom and knowledge.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>22a</sup>You explain deep mysteries,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>22b-c</sup>because even the dark is light to you.

If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002019\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002023\"><h3>Paragraph 2:19–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">God revealed to Daniel what the king had dreamed and what the dream meant. Daniel expressed his thanks to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author has recorded Daniel’s prayer of thanks in poetic form. Some translations (for example, the NJB) indicate this by the way they print the lines. You may have a special way of writing poetic speech in your language. If so, you may use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In his prayer of thanks, Daniel first refers to God in the third person (using the pronouns “he/him”). Then in 2:23 he switches to the second person (that is, using the pronoun “you”). In some languages this change may be unnatural. See the General Comment on 2:20–22.</p></div><h4>2:23a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> are the God of my forefathers, and I thank you and praise you</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My</span> God, you<sup>(sing)</sup> are the one whom my ancestors served/worshiped. I give you thanks and praise,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To You, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise:</strong> In 2:23 Daniel began to speak to God directly, using the second-person pronoun <em>You</em>. This is the climax of the prayer. The Aramaic word order of this sentence is unusual. The pronoun <em>You</em> comes before the verb to emphasize that God was the one Daniel praised. Use a word order that is natural for conveying this emphasis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To you do I give thanks and praise, God of my ancestors.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O God of my fathers:</strong> The Hebrew expression that the BSB translates as <em>God of my fathers</em> is a title for the one true God. It indicates that Daniel’s ancestors worshiped the Lord, the God of Israel, as Daniel himself did. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God my ancestors served</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God my ancestors <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> worshiped</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to address God directly with a title such as this. If that is true in your language, it may be best to translate this information as a separate statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are the God who was worshiped by my ancestors. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>fathers:</strong> Here the word <em>fathers</em> refers to Daniel’s parents, grandparents, and other ancestors, both male and female.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I give thanks and praise:</strong> The two expressions that the BSB translates as <em>thanks</em> and <em>praise</em> have similar meanings. The repetition of the idea adds emphasis. In some languages it may be natural to translate these two words with an expression that adds emphasis in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I give heartfelt thanks</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I greatly praise</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>I give thanks:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates here with the noun <em>thanks</em> means to express appreciation, to acknowledge with gratitude what God has done.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>praise:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates with the noun <em>praise</em> means to “worship, adore.”</p><h4>2:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because You have given me wisdom and power.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you<sup>(sing)</sup> have made me wise and you<sup>(sing)</sup> have given me power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to understand the dream.</span></p></li><li><p>for you<sup>(sing)</sup> have made me wise. You<sup>(sing)</sup> have given me the ability <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to understand this mystery</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> In the Aramaic text this verse part connects to the previous verse part with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>because</em>. Here this conjunction introduces the reason why Daniel thanked and praised God. Connect these verse parts in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You have given me wisdom and power:</strong> The Aramaic words that the BSB translates as <em>wisdom</em> and <em>power</em> are the same ones that were used in 2:20b. In 2:20 Daniel praised God for being the one who gives wisdom and power in general. Here in 2:23b he praised God for giving him wisdom and power in this situation. See the note on 2:20b. In some languages it may be natural to translate <em>wisdom</em> and <em>power</em> using adjectives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have made me wise and strong</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> This refers to insight that God gives. See the Notes at 1:4b and 1:17a. See also the note on 2:20b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>power:</strong> In this context the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>power</em> refers to a special ability. God gave Daniel the ability to know and understand the king’s dream. He could not have understood it by himself. See the Notes at 2:20b.</p><h4>2:23c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts are a parallel couplet. 2:23d repeats the information in 2:23c in a different way, and the phrases “what we have requested” and “the dream of the king” refer to the same idea. This repetition is used for emphasis. The same verb that the BSB translates as “have made known” is also used in both verse parts.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages this repetition may imply that the two verse parts refer to different things. If that is true in your language, it may be best to combine these verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For when we asked you about the king’s matter/dream, you revealed it to us.</p></blockquote><h4>2:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And now You have made known to me what we have requested,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> have revealed to me what we<sup>(excl)</sup> asked.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> have answered our<sup>(excl)</sup> prayers.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And now You have made known to me what we have requested:</strong> Daniel thanked God for revealing or telling him the king’s dream and its meaning. See the Notes on the verb “tell” at 2:5b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what we have requested:</strong> This refers to the prayer of Daniel and his friends in 2:18a. Daniel’s friends had done as he urged them and asked God to reveal the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>we:</strong> The pronoun <em>we</em> is exclusive here. It refers to Daniel and his three friends.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:23c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in this verse part, translating it in the order in which events happened. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We asked you to tell us something, and you told it to me.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:23d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:23d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for You have made known to us the dream of the king.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> have explained to us<sup>(excl)</sup> the king’s dream.”</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> have solved for us<sup>(excl)</sup> the king’s problem/mystery.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Aramaic text connects this verse part to the previous verse part with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>for</em>. In this context it introduces a restatement of the previous verse part and helps to indicate that 2:23c and 2:23d form a parallelism. It also adds emphasis to the climax of the prayer. In some languages a conjunctioni will not be needed. Connect these verse parts in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You told us what the king wants to know. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that is, you revealed to us the king’s dream</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You have made known to us the dream of the king:</strong> This verse part tells more specifically what it was that God had <em>made known</em> to Daniel and his friends.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to us:</strong> God had revealed the dream to Daniel, and he was going to tell his friends. He was the representative of the four men. So Daniel used the plural pronoun <em>us</em> here, referring to himself and his friends. This is an exclusive pronoun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the dream of the king:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the dream of the king</em> more literally uses the general term “the matter/word of the king.” It refers to the king’s dream and its meaning. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what the king wants to know (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the answer for the king (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king’s problem (NJB)</p></blockquote>",

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002024\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002025\"><h3>Paragraph 2:24–25</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph there is a change of setting. Daniel went to Arioch and told him that he could interpret the king’s dream. Arioch took him to the king.</p></div><h4>2:24a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:24a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So Daniel went to speak to Arioch,</p></li><li><p>¶ And Daniel returned to speak to Arioch.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Therefore</em> here introduces a result. Because God revealed the dream to Daniel (2:19–23), Daniel went immediately to Arioch and asked him if he could speak to the king. Introduce what Daniel did as in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel went to Arioch:</strong> The Aramaic verb literally means “went in,” as in 2:16. Daniel entered the room where Arioch was in order to talk to him. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel went in to see Arioch (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel went to meet with Arioch</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Arioch:</strong> The author first referred to <em>Arioch</em> in 2:14a. Spell his name here as you did there.</p><h4>2:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">official</span> who had orders from the king to kill the Babylonian advisers/sages.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This Arioch</span> was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the captain/commander</span> to whom the king had given the responsibility of putting to death the experts of Babylon.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon:</strong> This is background information. The author is reminding his readers of what he told them in 2:14, that Arioch was the commander of the men who were going to kill the royal advisers. In some languages it may be natural to imply that Arioch was not going to kill all the wise men personally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom the king had made responsible for putting the Babylonian sages to death (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom the king had commanded to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">oversee/organize</span> the execution of the wise men of Babylon</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who had been given the responsibility of having the Babylonian wise men executed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>whom the king had appointed:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>whom the king had appointed</em> indicates that the king had given Arioch a certain task or responsibility. Some ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom the king had ordered (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the officer</span> put in charge</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to whom the king had entrusted the task</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to destroy the wise men of Babylon:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>destroy</em> means “execute, kill.” See the Notes at 2:12b and 2:18b. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>putting the Babylonian sages to death (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that the wise men of Babylon be executed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of the execution<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Message</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wise men:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>wise men</em> refers to the king’s experts and advisors. See the Notes at 2:12b, where the same word is used. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>royal advisers (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>wise advisers (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>sages (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> See the Notes at 2:12b. You will want to translate in the same way here.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:24a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder 2:24a–b, translating the background information first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>24b</sup>Arioch was the man whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon. <sup>24a</sup>So Daniel went to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>24b</sup>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">officer/commander</span> charged/entrusted with the execution of the Babylonian wise men was Arioch, <sup>24a</sup>so Daniel went to him</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:24c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:24c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and said to him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Daniel said, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Sir</span>, do not execute<sup>(sing)</sup> the wise men of Babylon!</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Please</span> spare<sup>(sing)</sup> the wise men of Babylon,” Daniel said.</p></li><li><p>“Halt/Stop<sup>(sing)</sup> these executions!” Daniel exclaimed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and said to him:</strong> This phrase introduces what Daniel said to Arioch. In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel told him (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Aramaic text introduces Daniel’s words with the phrase “he went/came and said thus to him.” Introduce what Daniel said to Arioch in a way that is natural in your language. The idea that Daniel went to Arioch was already stated in 2:24a, so the BSB leaves it implicit here. But some English translations translate it explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He came and said to him (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He approached him and said (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not execute the wise men of Babylon!:</strong> The verb phrase <em>Do not execute</em> is in the form of a command. However, Daniel was not in a position to command Arioch. He was advising Arioch that he should not kill the wise men or that it was not necessary to do so. He was speaking politely but urgently. Indicate this in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Since Arioch was in charge of the guards who were to do the actual executions, in some languages it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not have the Babylonian wise men killed/executed.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not order the wise men of Babylon to be killed.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to express this idea with a positive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let the wise men of Babylon live.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Spare the lives of the Babylonian wise men.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><em>the wise men of Babylon</em> were just mentioned in 2:24b. So in some languages it may be natural to leave this phrase implied or abbreviate the reference. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let the wise men live!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Call off the execution!<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Message</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>2:24d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:24d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If you<sup>(sing)</sup> take me to the king, I will interpret the dream for him.”</p></li><li><p>“Let<sup>(sing)</sup> me come with you<sup>(sing)</sup> to the king, for I can let him know what his dream means.”</p></li><li><p>“I can tell the king the meaning of his dream. So bring/lead<sup>(sing)</sup> me to him!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Bring me before the king:</strong> Daniel needed someone in authority to accompany him and ask permission for him to speak to the king. Use the verb that is most natural in your language. It may be natural to imply that the king had higher status or authority than Daniel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Take me to the king (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Present me to/before the king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Take me into the king’s presence (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I will give him the interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>give him the interpretation</em> is literally “declare the interpretation.” Daniel would tell the king what his dream meant. Some other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I will show the king the interpretation (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I will tell him what his dream means (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I will tell him the meaning of his dream (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:24c–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate these verse parts as indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel asked Arioch not to kill the wise men but to take him to the king so that he could interpret the king’s dream for him.</p></blockquote></div>",

Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002024\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002025\"><h3>Paragraph 2:24–25</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph there is a change of setting. Daniel went to Arioch and told him that he could interpret the king’s dream. Arioch took him to the king.</p></div><h4>2:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Arioch hastily brought Daniel before the king</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Arioch immediately took Daniel to the king.</p></li><li><p>Arioch quickly/hastily led Daniel into the king’s presence.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Aramaic text connects this verse part with the previous verse part using a common connector that most English versions translate as “Then” to indicate that in this context, it introduces the next event in a temporal sequence. A few versions, such as the NET, translate this connector as “So” to indicate that Arioch brought Daniel to the king as a result of his request. The BSB and some other versions do not explicitly translate it. Introduce what Arioch did next in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Arioch hastily brought Daniel before the king:</strong> Arioch was able to arrange a meeting with King Nebuchadnezzar straight away. He and Daniel went before the king. They probably went down on their knees before the king.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hastily:</strong> This word means “quickly, in a hurry.” Here are some ways that English versions translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Arioch <u>immediately</u> took Daniel to the king (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Arioch <u>rushed</u> Daniel into the king’s presence (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Antioch hurried Daniel to the king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brought:</strong> See the Notes at 2:24d, where the same verb is used. Arioch accompanied or led Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><h4>2:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and said to him, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He said to the king, “I have located someone among the exiles from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of</span> Judah</p></li><li><p>He told the king, “It has come to my attention that there is a man among the Judean exiles</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and said to him:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces the next event in a temporal sequence. In some languages, it may help to add some implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When they arrived</span> , Arioch said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the king</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have found a man:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>found</em> here refers to locating someone that the speaker did not know existed. Arioch did not know that anyone could do what Daniel said he was able to do. In some languages a literal translation may suggest that Daniel was lost or that Arioch had not known where he was. To avoid these wrong meanings it may be possible to translate 2:25b–c as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have found out that one of the men brought here from Judah can explain your dream. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It has come to my attention that one of the exiles from Judah can tell you what your dream means.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>among the exiles from Judah:</strong> The term <em>exiles</em> describes people who have been forced to leave their home country. The people of Babylon had conquered Judah and forced many of the Jewish people there to leave their homes and come to live in Babylon. Daniel was one of these people. Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one of the Jewish exiles (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one of the captives of Judah (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one of the men brought here from Judah (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who will tell the king the interpretation.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who is able to tell Your Majesty the meaning of your dream.”</p></li><li><p>who can interpret your dream, O king.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who will tell the king the interpretation:</strong> The Aramaic verb form that the BSB translates as <em>will tell</em> here expresses both the ability and the intention to do something. Daniel was able and willing to tell the king the meaning of his dream. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who can reveal the meaning to the king (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who can explain the dream’s meaning to you, Your Majesty (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the king:</strong> Arioch was speaking to the king, but he referred to him in the third person. This was a common way in that culture to show respect for someone in authority. See the Notes at 2:20b. This may not be natural in your language. If not, other possibilities are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a second-person reference such as “you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who can explain the dream’s meaning to you (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a special way to address a king directly.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry.

This formula gives some emphasis to Daniel’s words. Some versions translate both verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel answered before the king and said (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce Daniel’s answer in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As the NASB quotation just above shows, the Aramaic text includes the phrase “before the king.” This is the same expression that was used in 2:10a to refer to addressing someone of higher status. The BSB does not explicitly translate this phrase. If it is natural in your language, you may indicate that Daniel was addressing a king. It may be natural to do this with an introductory form of address. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel replied, “Your Majesty…” (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>No wise man, enchanter, medium, or magician can explain to the king the mystery of which he inquires:</strong> Daniel told the king that none of the various Babylonian experts could tell him what he wanted to know. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty, there is no wizard, magician, fortuneteller, or astrologer who can tell you that. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use plural forms for the different types of experts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There are no wise men, enchanters, magicians, or fortunetellers who can reveal the king’s secret. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is not possible for any of the expert advisers to solve your mystery for you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>No wise man, enchanter, medium, or magician:</strong> Notice that the list of experts in this verse part is not the same as the list in 2:2a or 2:10b. This implies that the author did not mean to give an exact list of all the experts. The names are probably examples of the various kinds of experts whom the king summoned. Your language may not have a specific term for each of these experts. You may have to use one term for two or three of the names listed here. Another option is to begin or end the list with a general term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Out of all your expert advisers—wise men, enchanters, magicians—there is no one who…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Among all your wizards, magicians, fortunetellers and other wise men there is none who…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wise man:</strong> This is the same expression that was used in 2:12. It seems to be a general term that could include any of the types of advisors that were mentioned. See the note on 2:12b.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>enchanter:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>enchanter</em> describes someone who performed rituals to obtain knowledge or to influence people’s futures. See the Notes at 2:2a and 2:10b.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>magician:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>magician</em> refers to a person who seemed to perform different occult functions. He probably interpreted dreams and foretold the future through divination. See the Notes at 2:2a and 2:10b.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>medium:</strong> This term describes a new group of experts whom Daniel did not mention in 2:2a or 2:10b. The exact meaning of this word is uncertain. It has been translated in various ways by English versions:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>astrologers (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>fortuneteller (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>exorcists (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>can explain to the king:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates <em>explain</em> is literally “tell.” The form of the verb can be interpreted differently:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It expresses a general truth: no human advisor would be able to reveal what the king wanted to know. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>can explain to the king (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, ESV, KJV, NJPS, GW, NLT, GNT, REB, NCV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to what had happened in the past. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>None…has been able to tell the king (NJB) <em>(NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the great majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>to the king:</strong> Daniel spoke to the king in the third person, as Arioch did in 2:25. See the note on 2:25c. This indirect address was a way to show special respect in that culture. Indicate respect in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the mystery of which he inquires:</strong> This refers to the king’s question in 2:26. Be sure that this is clear in your translation.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002026\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002028\"><h3>Paragraph 2:26–28</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel told the king that God had revealed to him the king’s dream. He introduced one of the central themes of the chapter: only God can reveal mysteries.</p></div><h4>2:28a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:28a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Only God who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">rules from</span> heaven can reveal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these</span> mysteries.</p></li><li><p>“However, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the true</span> God in heaven can do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what human experts cannot do.</span> He is the one who reveals <span data-bnType=\"implied\">such</span> secrets.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a contrast with the previous verse. Although no human expert could reveal the king’s secret, there is a God in heaven who reveals such secrets. Express this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries:</strong> This sentence contrasts God with the various wise men mentioned in 2:27. He could do what they could not do. Translate this in a way that makes the contrast clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the God who rules from heaven does reveal mysteries</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a God in heaven:</strong> This is the same title for God that was used in 2:18. See the Notes at 2:18a. It refers to the true God. It does not indicate there is more than one God. In some languages it may therefore be necessary to say:</p><p data-indent=\"3\">the God who is in heaven</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to expand this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who rules from heaven (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heaven:</strong> This refers to the place where God lives, not merely to the sky. See KBT for suggestions on how to translate this key term.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mysteries:</strong> This refers to secrets such as the king’s dream and its interpretation. These were things that only God could reveal. See the Notes in 2:18a and 2:27.</p><h4>2:28b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:28b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">given this dream to you</span>, my king, in order that you<sup>(sing)</sup> may know what will happen in the time to come.</p></li><li><p>He has caused you<sup>(sing)</sup> to have this dream in order that you<sup>(sing)</sup> can know what will happen in the future.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>has made known</em> is the same as the verb translated as “will tell” in 2:25c. It means to inform or make something known. In this context it indicates that God gave Nebuchadnezzar the dream in order to let him know future events. God did not tell Nebuchadnezzar directly, and at this time Nebuchadnezzar did not yet know the meaning of the dream. Here is one way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has given this dream to you, king, in order that you may know what will happen in the future.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, to express this idea, it may be natural to use a different verb tense or to speak of something that God had already done, such as giving the dream<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Aramaic verb refers to something that God had already done. Most English versions translate it in the present perfect tense, as the BSB does. The reason for this tense may not be clear to readers, since God had not yet revealed the meaning of the dream to the king. Daniel was about to explain it to him. The GW translates this verb in the future tense.</span></span>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will tell King Nebuchadnezzar (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>King Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> Daniel spoke to the king in the third person. This was a way of showing respect to someone of higher status. see the Notes at 2:27b. If this is not natural in your language, you may use the second person. However, it is important to translate the attitude of respect. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for God has told you, O King,…<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>G has: “O King live forever.” This may be an assimilation to 2:24.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what will happen in the latter days:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates <em>in the latter days</em> is more literally “at the end of the days.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>MT, Theodotian, G. The phrase occurs again in Daniel 10:14.</span></span> It is traditionally translated as <em>in the latter days</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BSB, KJV, NASB, RSV, ESV.</span></span> This phrase refers to a time in the future when there will be important changes. Scholars interpret it differently here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase refers in a general way to the future.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Le Semeur; GeCL97; Baldwin (p. 93).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in days to come (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the future (GNT) <em>(GNT, NLT, KJV, CEV, NCV, NIV, GW, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase is a technical term that refers to the end of time and history.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Horst Seebass, TDOT 1 (1974): 207–12. See the discussion in Collins, p. 161. Other passages that interpret the phrase in this way include Ezekiel 38:16, Daniel 10:14, Hosea 3:5, Isaiah 2:2, and Micah 4:1).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the final days (NJB) <em>(REB, NJB, NRSV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) is probably best in this context. You may wish to follow the BSB, which uses a phrase which could mean either interpretation (1) and (2). The dream told about what would happen in the near as well as the distant future.</p><h4>2:28c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:28c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay on your bed were these:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is the dream you<sup>(sing)</sup> dreamed as you lay on your bed.</p></li><li><p>I will now tell you<sup>(sing)</sup> the vision that you saw while you were on your bed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay on your bed were these:</strong> This verse part introduces Daniel’s explanation of the content and meaning of the king’s dream. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These, then, are the dream and the visions that passed through your head as you were lying in bed (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The dream and the visions you had while lying on your bed are as follows. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now I will tell you your dream and the visions you saw as you lay on your bed. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your dream and the visions:</strong> In this context the Aramaic expressions that the BSB translates as <em>Your dream</em> and <em>the visions</em> probably refer to the same thing. The book of Daniel does not seem to distinguish between the two terms. For the plural <em>visions</em>, see the Notes at 2:1. Nebuchadnezzar probably dreamed the same dream on several different nights.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to make it clear that the words <em>dream</em> and “vision” have the same meaning here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is your dream, the vision you saw (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages you may have only one word for these two terms. If that is true in your language, you may translate using just the one word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will now tell you what you saw in your dream….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that came into your mind:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>that came into your mind</em> is more literally “of your head,” as in the RSV. It indicates that the king did not see the visions with his physical eyes. They occurred while he was on his bed asleep.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as you lay on your bed:</strong> This phrase tells where the dream occurred. The king was in his bed. It is implied he was lying there asleep. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while you were asleep (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while lying on your bed (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages you may not need to make this information explicit, because it is implied by the context and the words “dream” and “visions.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were these:</strong> This expression introduces the description of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. The word <em>these</em> refers to the details of the dream that Daniel would tell the king. Daniel did not actually begin to describe those details until 2:31. He continued the introduction to his speech in 2:29–30. So in some languages it may be more natural to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will now explain your dreams and the visions that passed through your mind.</p></blockquote>",

For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002029\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002030\"><h3>Paragraph 2:29–2:30</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 2:29–30 repeats much of the information that was in 2:27–28. The repetition emphasizes one of the main themes of this narrative: Only God can reveal the events that will happen in the future.</p></div><h4>2:30a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:30a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And to me this mystery has been revealed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The reason why I have come to know this mystery</p></li><li><p>And he has shown me this mystery</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And to me:</strong> In Aramaic this verse part connects with the previous verse part with a common conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>And</em>. Most English versions translate it as “But.” A few versions do not explicitly translate it. Connect this verse part to the previous verse part in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Aramaic text, the pronoun <em>me</em> comes at the start of this sentence. It indicates a contrast. Daniel is contrasting the way that God is the “Revealer of Mysteries” (2:29b) with the way that he himself does not have “more wisdom than any man alive” (2:30b). Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But as for me (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some translations do not translate this phrase, since the contrast is implied by the context. Introduce the contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this mystery has been revealed:</strong> This is a passive clause. If it is more natural to use an active clause in your language you may supply the implied subject (God). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has allowed me to understand this mystery</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God also told this secret to me… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mystery:</strong> See the Notes at 2:18a. The mystery was something that only God could reveal. Be careful not to use a word that is related to local pagan religions.</p><h4>2:30b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:30b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not because I have more wisdom than any man alive,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>is not because I am wiser than everyone else,</p></li><li><p>not on account of my unique wisdom</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not because I have more wisdom than any man alive:</strong> This clause indicates what was <u>not</u> the cause of the previous verse part. It was not because Daniel was wiser than anyone else that he was able to understand the mystery. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not because I possess more wisdom than any other living person (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I have more wisdom:</strong> To <em>have…wisdom</em> means to be wise. The Aramaic phrase is more literally “the wisdom that is in me.” In some languages, <em>wisdom</em> is not something that is “in” a person or that can be had/possessed by a person. It may be more natural to translate this idea using an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am wiser (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am smarter (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am very wise compared to everyone else</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>than any man alive:</strong> The phrase <em>any man alive</em> here refers to any other human being alive at that time. There is no implied contrast to dead human beings. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>more than any other living being (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>than anyone else (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:30a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to have the negative verb in 2:30a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>these mysteries weren’t explained to me because I am smarter than anyone else (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This secret wasn’t revealed to me because I’m wiser than anyone else. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In other languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 2:30a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>30b</sup>And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else <sup>30a</sup>that I know the secret of your dream (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:30c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:30c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God wants/intends</span> you<sup>(sing)</sup> to learn what your dream means</p></li><li><p>but in order that you<sup>(sing)</sup> may understand the meaning/interpretation</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> here introduces a clause that contrasts with 2:30b. It tells the real reason why God revealed the dream to Daniel. God’s intention was to inform the king about future events.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king:</strong> This is a purpose clause. The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>in order that</em> introduces the purpose for which God revealed the dream to Daniel. God’s purpose was the reason why the dream was revealed to Daniel. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for this sole purpose (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but because God wants you to understand (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the interpretation might be made known to the king:</strong> In the Aramaic this is literally “that they might cause the king to know.” It is an indefinite plural pronoun and refers ultimately to the work of God. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the interpretation may be made known to the king (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but in order that the king might understand the dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you may know what it means (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that Your Majesty may learn the meaning of your dream (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>2:30d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:30d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and understand what you<sup>(sing)</sup> were thinking about.</p></li><li><p>of what you<sup>(sing)</sup> dreamed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind:</strong> Here the phrase <em>and that</em> introduces God’s second purpose in revealing the dream to Daniel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>may understand:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>may understand</em> here means “may come to know,” that is, “may learn.” It refers to something that the king did not know and was about to learn from Daniel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the thoughts of your mind:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>the thoughts of your mind</em> is more literally “the thoughts of your heart” (as in the KJV). In the Aramaic language and culture, people considered the heart as the center of thinking. In some languages it may not be necessary to mention the mind or heart. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your innermost thoughts (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what you were thinking about (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what worries you</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:30a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:30 Daniel denied that his own wisdom caused him to understand the dream. He stated that the cause of his understanding was God’s purpose to inform the king of the future. In some languages it may be natural to reorder 2:30a–d and put the positive statement before the negative. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This mystery has been revealed to me so that Your Majesty may learn the interpretation of your dream. It was not revealed because I am wiser than everyone else!</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:30c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">God’s two purposes in revealing the dream are similar and some versions combine them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was done so that you might understand what you have seen (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but because God wants you to understand what was in your heart (NLT)</p></blockquote></div>",

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas.

The details follow. Other ways to translate this summary description include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O king, you saw in your dream a large statue standing before you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As you watched, there appeared to your majesty a great image (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In your vision, you saw (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O king:</strong> Daniel addressed the king in a respectful and formal way. See also the note on 2:29a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a great statue appeared:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>appeared</em> often introduces a dream (Daniel 4:7; 7:2). It introduces something that is unexpected or surprising. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and behold, a great image (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may have a different way of translating this idea in your language.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some English versions have “behold” (KJV, RSV). The NRSV has “lo!” Some versions translate “in front of you” (NLT, NIV) or “standing before you” (GNT, similarly the CEV). Some versions do not translate this word (GW, REB).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>suddenly you saw a great statue</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you saw a great statue, right there in front of you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>great:</strong> This adjective refers to the statue’s size. It was big and tall, much taller than a man. See the General Comment on 2:31.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The following are some different ways that English versions translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>large (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>huge (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>giant (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>statue:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>statue</em> here refers to a model or image of a man, greater than life size. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>image (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is probably best not to translate it using a word whose primary meaning is “idol.” There is no mention of people worshiping this statue.</p><h4>2:31b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:31b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>A great and dazzling statue stood before you, and its form was awesome.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was a huge statue, glittering and awesome to look at.</p></li><li><p>It was enormous, bright and awe-inspiring.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A great and dazzling statue stood before you, and its form was awesome:</strong> Daniel continued to describe the statue that the king had seen in his dream. While several English versions translate 2:31 as a single sentence, most versions begin a new clause or sentence here, as the BSB does. In some languages it may be natural to do that as well. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This statue was enormous, dazzling bright, and awesome in appearance.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was terrifying. (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Huge and dazzling, it stood before you, awesome to behold. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>great</em> indicates that the statue was big and tall. It has the same basic meaning as the word that is translated as “great” in 2:31.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some translations only translate these two synonyms with one word. See the GW, GNT, CEV, NCV. Theodotian omits the first word. The Old Greek puts both words in the second sentence; “very great statue.” See Collins, p. 151.</span></span> Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>huge (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dazzling:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>dazzling</em> is literally “its splendor was extraordinary.” This indicates that the statue was very bright and shiny. English versions have different ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shining brightly (NLT, CEV )</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This statue was very bright (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bright and shining (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>statue:</strong> See the Notes at 2:31, where the same word occurs. In some languages it may be important to mention that the statue looked like the figure of a person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a huge and powerful statue <u>of a man</u> (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stood:</strong> In some languages, only people can stand. You should use a word that is natural in your language to describe the statue. In some cases it may not be necessary to describe the position of the statue, since statues are usually in an upright, vertical position. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you saw a huge…statue in front of you. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before you:</strong> This expression indicates that the statue was in front of the king. It was right in the direction that he was looking. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in front of you (NCV, NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its form was awesome:</strong> The Aramaic text says literally “its appearance was terrible/terrifying.” This indicates that the statue caused fear in those who saw it. It was probably the immense size of the statue and its amazing brightness that caused fear. There are different ways to translate this feeling, for which the BSB uses the term <em>awesome</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>terrifying (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>terrible to see (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate clause or sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and its appearance was frightening (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was a frightening sight. (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:31</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Aramaic text, the information that the statue was standing before the king is found near the end of the verse. This is followed by several English versions, including the BSB. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>31a</sup>You were looking, O king, and there was a great statue. This statue was huge, its brilliance extraordinary; <sup>31b</sup>it was standing before you and its appearance was frightening. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>31a</sup>Your Majesty, you had a vision. You saw a large statue. This statue was very bright. <sup>31b</sup>It stood in front of you, and it looked terrifying. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>31a</sup>O king, in your dream you saw a huge, shiny, <sup>31b</sup>and frightening statue in front of you. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other English versions have reordered the information in a way that is natural in English. Some examples of translations that reorder the text include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>31a</sup>Your Majesty looked, <sup>31b</sup>and there before you stood <sup>31a</sup>a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, <sup>31b</sup>awesome in appearance. (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>31</sup>Your Majesty, in your vision you saw <sup>31b</sup>in front of you <sup>31a</sup>a huge and powerful statue of a man, shining brilliantly, <sup>31b</sup>frightening and awesome. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>31</sup>Your Majesty, what you saw <sup>31b</sup>standing in front of you <sup>31a</sup>was a huge <sup>31b</sup>and terrifying <sup>31a</sup>statue, shining brightly. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Follow the order that is most natural in your language.</p></div>",

For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002031\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002035\"><h3>Paragraph 2:31–2:35</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel told the king what he had seen in his dream.</p></div><h4>2:32a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:32a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The head of the statue was pure gold,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The head of the statue was made of the best gold.</p></li><li><p>The head of the statue was high/top quality gold.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel described the statue from the top down to the bottom. The top parts had greater value than the lower parts.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The head of the statue was pure gold:</strong> See the Notes on “image” at 2:31a. The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates <em>was</em> is the past tense of the verb “to be.” However, your language may have a different way to translate this idea. Some possibilities are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The head of this statue was made of fine gold. (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb with an indefinite subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They had made the head of fine gold.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use only a form of the verb “to be,” as in the Aramaic, as the BSB does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The head of this image was of fine gold. (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there was a pure gold head</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pure gold:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>pure gold</em> is literally “good gold.” It was easy for people to bend and form this metal. As a result, people were able to make coins and jewelry from gold. It is the heaviest and most valuable of the four metals that Daniel mentioned in this section. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the finest gold (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fine gold (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not have a word for <em>gold</em> you may have to borrow a term in the national language. Another possibility is to describe gold as “the most precious metal.”</p><h4>2:32b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:32b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>its chest and arms were silver,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The chest and arms of the statue were made of silver.</p></li><li><p>The chest and arms were silver.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>its:</strong> Most English versions use the neuter pronoun <em>its</em>. Use the pronoun that is most natural in your language to refer to a statue that represents a male figure.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>chest:</strong> Each language has its own way of describing the different parts of the body. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>chest</em> refers to the part of the body between the shoulders and the stomach. Some English versions say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>breast</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the term that is natural in your language to refer to the upper part of a man’s body.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>silver:</strong> This metal is valuable but less valuable than gold. In that culture <em>silver</em> was a standard of trade and a symbol of wealth. People used <em>silver</em> to make jewelry, coins, decorations, and coverings for cups. If you do not have a word for silver, you may:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Borrow a national language term.</p></li><li><p>Use a general expression such as “a less precious metal.”</p></li></ul><h4>2:32c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:32c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>its belly and thighs were bronze,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The belly and thighs of the statue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">were made</span> of bronze,</p></li><li><p>From the waist to the knees was bronze,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>belly and thighs:</strong> Each language has its own way of describing the different parts of the body. Use the expression that most naturally describes this part of the body in your language. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from its waist down to its knees (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language has only one word to describe both the belly and the thighs, you can use that word here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>belly:</strong> This word describes the middle of the body, the “abdomen.” It is the part of the body that extends from just below the chest to the hips.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>middle (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stomach (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>waist (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>thighs:</strong> This word describes the part of the human leg between the hips and the knee. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>upper part of the legs (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bronze:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>bronze</em> can refer to either bronze or copper. Most English versions say “bronze.” Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. It is stronger than copper and has a reddish-brown color. People used this metal to make tools and weapons. If your language does not have a word for <em>bronze</em>, other possibilities for translation are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Borrow a national language term.</p></li><li><p>Use a general expression such as “an even less precious metal.”</p></li></ul>",

He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47.

Some ancient versions, such as the Greek Septuagint, include the phrase “from a mountain,” explaining from where the rock was cut. Scholars differ about whether this phrase was part of the original text:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Many English versions do not include this phrase. Only later in 2:45 does the text explain that the stone came from a mountain. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As you looked, a stone was cut out (ESV) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, ESV, RSV/NRSV, NCV, NJB, NJPS, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Some English versions do include this phrase.

However, in some languages it may be good to include the phrase as implied information, to explain what the stone was cut from.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a stone was cut out:</strong> This is a passive clause. The Aramaic does not indicate who or what caused the rock to separate from the cliff face. It is implied in the context that it was God or his angels, but this is not stated explicitly. There are several ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using an active verb with an indefinite subject supplied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">one/they</span> cut out the rock</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb with the stone itself as the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a stone broke away (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a passive verb.

It implies that a supernatural being cut the rock from the mountain. Some English versions translate literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not by hands (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in some languages a literal translation could imply that people used tools or some other way to cut out the stone. Check that your translation does not imply this. In some languages it may be necessary to avoid mention of <em>hands</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not by humans (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may have a way in your language to imply that God caused this to happen without saying so directly. The BSB implies this by supplying the word <em>human</em>.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002031\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002035\"><h3>Paragraph 2:31–2:35</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel told the king what he had seen in his dream.</p></div><h4>2:35a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:35a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were shattered</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then the statue made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay collapsed all at once.</p></li><li><p>Then suddenly the whole statue—iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold—<span data-bnType=\"implied\">fell and</span> broke into pieces.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates <em>Then</em> here introduces the next event in the narrative.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were shattered:</strong> This is a passive clause that uses a different form of the same verb as in 2:34c.

Daniel compared the broken pieces of the statue to <em>chaff</em>. The point of this comparison is that the pieces of the statue that were left were extremely small, almost as small as dust. They were as small and insignificant as chaff. Be sure that this idea is clear in your translation. In some languages it may be necessary to make the point of the comparison explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tiny as</span> the bits of straw when a person threshes wheat during the summer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as <u>small as</u> chaff on a threshing floor (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>chaff:</strong> The word <em>chaff</em> refers to the part of the wheat that people did not eat, the husks. These husks had no value and were very light. Refer to this <em>chaff</em> in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>husks of wheat (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your readers are not familiar with <em>chaff</em>, you may have to substitute a word with a similar meaning that refers to something small and of little value. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dust (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on the threshing floor:</strong> Farmers put their harvested wheat on a hard, level surface called a <em>threshing floor</em>. Then they beat it with sticks or made their cattle walk over it. This caused the grain to separate from the husks, and it all lay on the threshing floor together. Afterwards the workers tossed the pieces into the air. The wind blew away the lighter chaff, and the good grain fell back to the floor. This floor was outdoors near their fields. Avoid using an expression that suggests an indoor location. It may be natural to use a more general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on a threshing place (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If people in your culture are unfamiliar with this type of action, it may be natural to include a footnote about how people threshed their wheat at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the option that is most appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in summer:</strong> There were two main seasons in the land of Israel, summer and winter. People plowed and planted in winter. The <em>summer</em> was the hot, dry season when people harvested their crops. Languages have different ways of describing the seasons of the year. Use the term that refers to the harvest season. Possibilities for translation include:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:35b</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate the name of the harvest season. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in summer (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use the word meaning “harvest.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>during the harvest<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See La Bible du Semeur.</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Omit the name of the season, if this information is implied by the context. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like chaff on a threshing floor (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">This clause introduces a lot of information that may be new to people in your culture. In some languages, it may be more natural to translate some of this information in a general way. Keep the focus on the fact that the remaining pieces of the statue were very small. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until nothing remained but pieces as fine/small as dust</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures it will be good to add a footnote explaining threshing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Farmers in Israel separated the good grain from the useless parts by beating it or treading on it and then tossing it into the air. The wind blew away the smaller, lighter, useless parts. Daniel compared the remains of the statue to the small, useless parts of wheat, the chaff.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:35c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:35c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The wind blew all the pieces away and there was nothing left <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the statue</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span>.</p></li><li><p>They were carried away by the wind and nothing was left behind.</p></li><li><p>the wind blew them away. And nothing remained <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the statue</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Aramaic text connects this verse part with the previous verse part using a common conjunction that many versions translate as “and.” In this context it introduces the next event in a series. The BSB and many other versions leave it untranslated. Introduce what happened next in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>carried…away</em> means to take or sweep something away, that is, to remove it. The wind scattered all the remaining pieces of the statue. Nothing was left to show that anything had been there. Use the expression that is natural in your language to describe what wind does to small objects. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The wind blew them away, leaving not a trace behind. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not a trace of them could be found:</strong> This phrase indicates the result of the wind’s action. There was nothing left of the statue after the pieces had blown away. Some ways to express this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one could see any sign of it.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there was nothing left (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>leaving nothing behind</p></blockquote><h4>2:35d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:35d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But the stone that had struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But the stone that struck the statue grew into a huge mountain. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">It became so big that</span> it covered the entire world.</p></li><li><p>However, the stone that hit the statue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">grew bigger and</span> became as large as a tall mountain. It was so big that it spread over all the earth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But the stone that had struck the statue became a great mountain:</strong> In the king’s dream, the statue had gone, but the rock remained. It grew and became as large as a mountain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>But:</strong> The connector that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a contrast between the statue and the rock. Nothing remained of the statue, but the stone became a huge mountain. Express this contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the stone:</strong> See the Note at 2:34a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that had struck the statue:</strong> The same phrase occurs in 2:34b. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rock that knocked the statue down (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>became a great mountain:</strong> In the king’s dream, the stone grew bigger in size until it became as big as a mountain. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>became a huge mountain (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grew and became a huge mountain (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grew to be a mountain (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and filled the whole earth:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>filled the whole earth</em> here indicates that the mountain became so big that it was everywhere on the earth. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that filled the entire earth (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that covered the whole earth (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that became present all over the world</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:35</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Aramaic text, 2:35 forms one long sentence. Most English versions break this up into two or more sentences. Use sentence lengths that are natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then all at once, the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold were smashed. They became like husks on a threshing floor in summer. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a large mountain which filled the whole world. (GW)</p></blockquote></div>",

The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002036\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002038\"><h3>Paragraph 2:36–2:38</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Daniel began to interpret the king’s dream.</p></div><h4>2:37a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:37a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You, O king, are the king of kings,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Your Majesty, you<sup>(sing)</sup> are the greatest of kings.</p></li><li><p>O king, you<sup>(sing)</sup> are surely the most powerful king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the world</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You, O king, are the king of kings:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates literally as <em>You, O king, are the king of kings</em> uses repetition to emphasize Nebuchadnezzar’s power and high status. It shows great respect and honors him. If would not be natural in your language to repeate the word <em>king</em>, you can indicate this honor in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty, you are the greatest of all kings. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty, you are the greatest king. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You, O king:</strong> Daniel addressed Nebuchadnezzar as <em>king</em>. Use the term of address that is most natural and respectful in your language for addressing a king or other top ruler. See also 2:4b, 2:29a. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your majesty (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the king of kings:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the king of kings</em> indicates that Nebuchadnezzar was more powerful than any other king. Some ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are the greatest king (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are the greatest of all the kings<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BFCL 88.</span></span> (similarly GNT, CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are the most powerful king</p></blockquote><h4>2:37b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:37b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, strength, and glory.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The God who rules from heaven has given you<sup>(sing)</sup> royal authority, power, strength, and majesty.</p></li><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> God, who rules from heaven, has made you<sup>(sing)</sup> a strong/powerful king/emperor. You are great and majestic!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, strength, and glory:</strong> Daniel asserted that it was God who had given Nebuchadnezzar his powerful position. All of Nebuchadnezzar’s glory and power came from God. The BSB follows the Aramaic text, in which the sentence continues from 2:37a. In many languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here, as several English versions have done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The God of heaven has granted you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The God of heaven has given you a kingdom. He has given you power, strength, and honor. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the God of heaven:</strong> The title <em>the God of heaven</em> refers to the one true God. See the Notes on this title at 2:18a. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The God who rules in heaven</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> God, who rules from heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>heaven</em> here refers to the spiritual realm where God lives.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has given sovereignty:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>has given sovereignty</em> here indicates that God had given Nebuchadnezzar his power to rule, his royal authority. God had made him emperor of Babylonia and caused him to reign over it. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has given you a kingdom (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has made you emperor (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has allowed you to rule/reign</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>power:</strong> In this context, the word <em>power</em> has a similar meaning to <em>sovereignty</em> and refers to Nebuchadnezzar’s royal authority. All the people of his realm did whatever he commanded. He had the final control over what happened.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>strength:</strong> The word <em>strength</em> is a near synonym of <em>power</em>. In this context, it probably refers to military strength. Use a general word that expresses this meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> In this context the clause <em>to whom…God…has given…glory</em> indicates that God had given Nebuchadnezzar his royal honor or majesty. Nebuchadnezzar lived and reigned in great splendor and magnificent beauty. People all over the known world were in awe of his wealth and greatness. See the key term “glory” 1(a) in KBT. See how you translated “glory” in this sense in Matthew 4:8 and Revelation 21:24, 26.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has highly honored you (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:37b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 2:37b has four words that are closely related in meaning. In some languages you may not have four words with a similar meaning. If that is true in your language, you may need to combine two or more of the words and emphasize the idea in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has highly honored you with power. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has given you full authority to rule in splendor.</p></blockquote></div>",

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>human beings, wild animals, birds of the air, wherever they live (NJB) <em>(BSB, RSV, GW, NJPS, NJB, NIV, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers only to <em>the sons of men</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>human beings, wherever they live, the wild animals of the field, and the birds of the air (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, REB, NASB, GNT, NLT, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both interpretations are possible and are strongly supported. Either is acceptable. Interpretation (1) is supported by several commentators and the BSB and is therefore followed in these notes. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Wherever people, wild animals, and birds live (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people, wild animals, and birds, wherever they live (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sons of men:</strong> This phrase refers to people in general, both men and women.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>beasts of the field:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>beasts of the field</em> means “wild animals.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wild beasts (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, Daniel did not mean that the king only ruled over the wild animals, not domesticated animals. If readers interpret this phrase in that way, it would be better to translate this term in a more general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>animals (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>birds of the air:</strong> In many languages the phrase <em>of the air</em> or “in the sky” is unnecessary. It may wrongly suggest that birds such as chickens (that do not generally fly) are not included. If that is true in your language, you may use a simple expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>birds (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He has given them into your hand:</strong> This reference to the <em>hand</em> of Nebuchadnezzar is figurative language that indicates that God had given him <u>power</u> over all people and animals. As king, Nebuchadnezzar had power to decide who should live and who should die. In many languages it may be natural to state the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has given you <u>control over</u> people, wild animals, and birds, wherever they live. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He has made you <u>ruler of</u> all the inhabited earth and ruler over all the animals and birds. (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:38a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB follows the phrase order of the Aramaic in 2:38a. Use the order that is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>38a</sup>human beings, wild animals, birds of the air, wherever they live, he has entrusted to your rule (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>38a</sup>and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>38a</sup>in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Note that the NIV connects the phrase “Wherever they live” with 2:38b. These Notes recommend that you connect it with 2:38a, as in all the other examples shown.</p></div><h4>2:38b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:38b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and has made you ruler over them all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God has appointed you<sup>(sing)</sup> the ruler over all of them.</p></li><li><p>He has caused you<sup>(sing)</sup> to rule over all living creatures.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and has made you ruler over them all:</strong> This expression repeats some information from 2:38a. It repeats the information, “He has given them into your hand.” It functions as a summary statement. God was the one who had permitted the king to rule over all people, animals, and birds. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>making you king of them all (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>making you rule over them all (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this summary statement as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has made you ruler of them all. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He has given you authority over them all. (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:38a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 2:38b repeats information from 2:38a. In some languages it may be more natural to combine these two parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>38a-b</sup>Wherever people, wild animals, and birds live, God made you ruler over them. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>38a-b</sup>God has allowed you to rule over all people, animals, and birds, wherever they live.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:38c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:38c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You are that head of gold.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> are the head of gold on the statue.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And so</span> the golden head of the statue represents you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and your kingdom</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are that head of gold:</strong> This clause is the climax of 2:36–38. Daniel declared that the head of gold in the dream represented King Nebuchadnezzar. He spoke of the king himself, rather than his kingdom, Babylonia. In this context the king represents his kingdom. Some possible ways to translate this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are the head of gold on that statue (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So then, the head of gold <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your dream</span>—it is you!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That head of gold symbolizes you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and your kingdom</span></p></blockquote>",

Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>empire (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>great kingdom (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to add implied information:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>another kingdom, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one symbolized by silver,</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This second <em>kingdom</em> has traditionally been identified with the empire of the Medes and the Persians (or Medo-Persian Empire). However, this is nowhere stated and many scholars disagree, so it should not be made explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>inferior to yours:</strong> The pronoun <em>yours</em> here means “your kingdom,” that is, Babylonia. The word <em>inferior</em> means to be less in quality or value than something else. It is best to use a general expression rather than indicating in what specific way this kingdom was inferior. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not as great as yours (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>2:39b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:39b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule the whole earth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>After that, a third kingdom will gain power over the whole world. The third kingdom is the bronze part of the statue.</p></li><li><p>Next a third kingdom will have authority over all the earth. That is what the bronze part of the statue represents.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule the whole earth:</strong> The middle part of the statue was made of bronze. This bronze part represented a third kingdom. This kingdom has been traditionally identified with the Greek empire. Again, this is disputed and should not be made explicit. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and after that a third, an empire of bronze, which will rule the whole earth (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then it will be followed by a kingdom of bronze that will rule the whole world. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Next:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>Next</em> here introduces the next kingdom in the temporal sequence. Other ways English versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then there will be… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>After that kingdom has fallen (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a third kingdom, one of bronze:</strong> Daniel identified the third kingdom with the bronze part of the statue. In some languages it may be necessary to make the comparison more clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a third kingdom, represented by bronze (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a third kingdom, the bronze part (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the kingdom after that will be like the bronze part <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the statue</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>bronze:</strong> See the Notes on <em>bronze</em> at 2:32c. Translate it here as you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will rule the whole earth:</strong> The phrase <em>rule the whole earth</em> emphasizes the great power of the third kingdom. The leaders of the third kingdom would have power over all the known world. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will rise to rule the world (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">kings</span> will rule over all the world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>its power will extend/reach over the whole world</p></blockquote>",

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002039\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002043\"><h3>Paragraph 2:39–2:43</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Daniel explained that the other parts of the statue represented three kingdoms that would have power after Nebuchadnezzar. Scholars disagree as to which historical kingdoms these are. These different views should not influence the way you translate. Scholars also differ in the way they interpret the fact that the metals progressively decline in value. It is best to translate this section as literally as possible.</p></div><h4>2:40a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:40a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And then a fourth kingdom will come into being/power. It will be strong like iron,</p></li><li><p>Next there will be a fourth kingdom. Iron is strong, and this kingdom will be strong,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron:</strong> Traditionally interpreters have identified this fourth kingdom with the Roman Empire. However, other interpreters dispute this, and you should not make it explicit. Ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then there will be a fourth kingdom, one strong like iron. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Following that kingdom, there will be a fourth one, as strong as iron. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The next kingdom to come to power will be as strong as iron.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Finally:</strong> The common Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>Finally</em> here introduces the next and final element in a series. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Next (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>there will be a fourth kingdom:</strong> The fourth kingdom would begin after the third one. Make the temporal sequence clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Following that kingdom, there will be a fourth one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the kingdom after that, kingdom four,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as strong as iron:</strong> This is a comparison that helps to explain the dream. The fourth kingdom is compared to <em>iron</em>, and the point of similarity is strength. The context implies that the kingdom would be a strong military power. See the Notes at 2:33a, and translate <em>iron</em> in the same way that you did there. Translate this comparison in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as iron is strong, so this kingdom will be strong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like iron, it will have great strength</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it will possess the strength of iron</p></blockquote><h4>2:40b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:40b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for iron shatters and crushes all things,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which breaks and shatters everything to pieces.</p></li><li><p>and like iron will break and shatter everything.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for iron shatters and crushes all things:</strong> There are two ways to understand the clause that the BSB translates as <em>for iron shatters and crushes all things</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to the previous clause and introduces an explanation of the way in which this fourth kingdom was like iron. It introduces an explanation of the comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which shatters and breaks everything (GNT) <em>(BSB, RSV, ESV, GW, GNT, NJB, NIV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to the following clause and forms the first half of another comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as iron crushes and smashes everything, it shall crush and shatter all these (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the same way that iron crushes and smashes things to pieces, the fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms. (NCV) <em>(NRSV, REB, NET, NLT, NCV, NASB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which seems the most natural reading in the context.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The choice of interpretation (2) leads to repetition with the following verse part.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>iron shatters and crushes all things:</strong> The two verbs <em>shatters</em> and <em>crushes</em> are similar in meaning. Daniel used two verbs to emphasize the strength of iron. Emphasize the strength of iron and its destructive power in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>iron breaks and smashes everything (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>iron totally breaks everything into pieces</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>shatters:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>shatters</em> means “crushes” or “grinds something into small pieces.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>crushes:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>crushes</em> means “smashes, shatters.” It can be used to describe the impact of a hammer on a fragile object.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>all things:</strong> This is a general phrase. Since iron was the strongest metal known at that time, people used it to break anything else they wanted to break. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>anything</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>everything (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:40c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:40c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and like iron that crushes all things,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Just as iron crushes all these,</p></li><li><p>And as iron breaks all these metals to pieces,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and like iron that crushes all things:</strong> This clause repeats information from 2:40b. Scholars differ as to whether this clause was in the original text.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This clause did form part of the original Aramaic text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and like iron which crushes (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, NJPS, GW, GNT, NIV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This clause was not in the original text. Some ancient versions (translations) do not include it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>40a,b,d</sup>Next, a kingdom of iron will come to power, crushing and shattering everything. (CEV) <em>(NRSV, CEV, NLT, NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Option (1) probably best represents the original text. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), translating this as the first half of a comparison, which continues in 2:40d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and like:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates <em>and like</em> introduce a comparison. The author compared the fourth kingdom to iron. You should make this comparison clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And just as (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Like iron that… (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>iron that crushes all things:</strong> The BSB has supplied the object <em>things</em>. You may supply a general object or leave it implicit, whichever is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>iron which crushes (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>crushes:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>crushes</em> is a different verb from the two verbs used in 2:40b. All three verbs are close synonyms. If you do not have a different verb to translate this idea, you can use one of the verbs you used in 2:40b.</p><h4>2:40d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:40d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it will shatter and crush all the others.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so the fourth kingdom will smash and crush the other <span data-bnType=\"implied\">kingdoms</span>.</p></li><li><p>in the same way the fourth kingdom will destroy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everything</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it will shatter and crush all the others:</strong> The two verbs <em>shatter</em> and <em>crush</em> are close synonyms. For the verb <em>shatter</em> see the note at 2:40b. For the verb <em>crush</em>, see the note at 2:40c. The use of two verbs emphasizes the idea. Translation models include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>shatters and breaks (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>totally smash</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it:</strong> The pronoun <em>it</em> refers to the fourth kingdom. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fourth kingdom will smash and crush (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all the others:</strong> The phrase <em>all the others</em> in this context refers to the three previous kingdoms. In some languages it may be natural to make this clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the other kingdoms (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the earlier empires (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:40</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Aramaic text 2:40a–d forms one sentence. The BSB has translated it as one sentence and the NIV has translated it as two sentences, 2:40a–b and c-d. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as three or more sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There will also be a fourth kingdom. It will be as strong as iron. (Iron smashes and shatters everything.) As iron crushes things, this fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms. (GW)</p></blockquote></div>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a kingdom which will be split in two (NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English translations use the word <em>divided</em>, which can have either meaning. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This fits best with the context of the rest of the verse. The different people groups or members of this kingdom/empire will not live in peace and harmony. There will be internal conflict.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:41a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reorder 2:41a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The fourth kingdom will not be united. That explains why the feet and the toes were part iron and part clay.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Similarly, the GeCL98.</span></span></p></blockquote></div><h4>2:41c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:41c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>yet some of the strength of iron will be in it—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, part of the fourth kingdom will be strong as iron</p></li><li><p>But it will contain some of the strength of iron,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>yet some of the strength of iron will be in it:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>yet</em> here introduces a contrast. Although the feet would be a mixture of iron and clay, it would still have parts in it that were strong. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but some of the strength of iron shall be in it (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will have something of the strength of iron (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>strength:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>strength</em> refers to the quality of being firm or hard. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>firmness (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stability (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use an adjective.

However, the emphasis is on the weakness of the material. Use an expression that suggests or implies this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>earthenware (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>Comment on 2:41c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reorder this clause.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002039\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002043\"><h3>Paragraph 2:39–2:43</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Daniel explained that the other parts of the statue represented three kingdoms that would have power after Nebuchadnezzar. Scholars disagree as to which historical kingdoms these are. These different views should not influence the way you translate. Scholars also differ in the way they interpret the fact that the metals progressively decline in value. It is best to translate this section as literally as possible.</p></div><h4>2:42a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:42a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Just as the toes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the statue</span> were part iron and part clay,</p></li><li><p>the toes consisted of some iron and some clay.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay:</strong> This clause repeats information from 2:41a, d, and uses it to make another comparison. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As in your vision the feet and toes were part iron and part potter’s clay (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The toes—partly iron and partly clay—mean that… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the vision, the toes were partly iron and partly clay. This means…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the toes of the feet:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the toes</em> is literally “the toes of the feet,” as in the NASB. In some languages it may be natural to translate in this way, but in many cases it may be more natural to follow the BSB or to say, following the NCV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The toes of the statue (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:42b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:42b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in the same way part of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the fourth</span> kingdom will be strong and part of it will be weak.</p></li><li><p>This shows/means that some of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the fourth</span> kingdom will be strong and some of it will be weak.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle:</strong> This is the second half of the comparison. Like the toes, the fourth kingdom will be a mixture of elements, part strong and part brittle. You can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Part of the fourth kingdom will be strong and part of it will be brittle</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>strong:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>strong</em> can be used to describe a material that is hard to break. In this context, however, it is used figuratively to describe a kingdom that is powerful and united. Try to find a word that can describe both a metal like iron and a country or empire.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brittle:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>brittle</em> can describe material that breaks easily. Here the word is used figuratively to describe a kingdom that is weak and not united. Again, try to use a word that readers can understand in both ways. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>weak (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>breakable (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fragile</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be most natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not strong</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:41–42</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a lot of repetition of information in 2:41–42. In some languages it may be natural to combine some of these verse parts and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This fourth kingdom will be divided—it will be both strong and brittle, just as you saw that the feet and toes were a mixture of iron and clay.</p></blockquote></div>",

This information is again used to begin making a comparison with the future kingdom. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This mixture of iron and clay also shows that… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>clay:</strong> This is the same phrase as in 2:41a. It is probably used to emphasize the weakness of this material, especially as compared to iron. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the clay of the earthenware (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>2:43b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:43b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so the peoples will mix with one another,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so <span data-bnType=\"implied\">its</span> people will be a mixture.</p></li><li><p>which shows/means that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the kingdom</span> will be a combination/alliance of people,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so the peoples will mix with one another:</strong> This is the second part of the comparison. The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>the peoples will mix with one another</em> is more literally “<u>they</u> will be mixing with the offspring/seed of humankind.” Daniel did not specify whether the pronoun “they” referred to people, rulers, races, cultures, or exactly what. Scholars interpret this clause in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to general social and political mixing/mingling. Different religious, social, or ethnic groups will try to unite. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will be a mixture (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NCV, NJPS, KJV, NASB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to people who try to unite together by intermarrying. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the rulers of that empire will try to unite their families by intermarriage (GNT) <em>(NJB, GNT, REB, NLT, RSV/NRSV, ESV, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) is recommended. It is good however to translate in such a way that this “mixing” could include intermarriage, as in interpretation (2).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Those commentators who interpret the fourth kingdom as the Greek Empire, see a reference to the marriages between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid dynasties. See Collins, pp. 170–71. These marriages are mentioned again I Daniel 11:6,17. Those who interpret the fourth kingdom as the Roman Empire, often interpret the pronoun as referring to different races of people. Collins (p. 171) cites Keil, Young.</span></span></p><h4>2:43c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:43c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but will not hold together</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But they will not remain/hold together</p></li><li><p>but it will eventually break up.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but will not hold together:</strong> The implied subject is indefinite, like the subject of the previous verb “will mix.” The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>hold together</em> means “stick together, cling.” This is a metaphor that in this context probably refers to the alliances that the various peoples of the fourth kingdom will make with one another. These alliances will not remain strong. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will not remain united (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But this will not succeed (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without adhering to one another (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but such alliances will not be stable (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use a positive verb. Try to use a verb that can be used of both alliances and physical objects like statues. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but it will crumble (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>but:</strong> The common Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> here introduces an action that is opposed to the action in the previous verse part. Although these people or peoples will mix, they will not keep a strong union. This is why many English versions, including the BSB, translate it as <em>but</em> here. Connect 2:43b to 2:43c in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>2:43d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:43d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>any more than iron mixes with clay.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>just as iron cannot remain mixed with clay.</p></li><li><p>For iron cannot <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> combine with clay.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>any more than iron mixes with clay:</strong> See the Notes on <em>iron</em> at 2:33a and <em>clay</em> at 2:33b. Iron and clay are substances that cannot be successfully united or joined together. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as iron and clay do not mix (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as iron does not unite with pottery</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as you/one cannot combine iron and clay</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this verse part may appear to involve a contradiction of 2:43a. If that is a problem in your language, you may be able to use a different verb here. The point is that although you can “mix” iron and clay, you cannot join or combine them into one. They will just fall apart again. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just as iron and clay don’t stick together (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>any more than iron will blend with clay (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:43a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:43 two comparisons are made between the statue’s feet and the fourth empire. In 2:43a and 2:43d Daniel talked about the statue, and in 2:43b and 2:43c, he talked about the empire. In some languages it may be natural to reorder these verse parts to put the references to the statue together and the references to the empire together. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>43a</sup>You saw the iron and clay mixed together, <sup>43d</sup>but iron and clay do not hold together. <sup>43b</sup>In the same way the people of the fourth kingdom will be a mixture, <sup>43c</sup>but they will not be united as one people. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Another possibility is to put either the statue or the empire as the first half of both the comparisons. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>43a</sup>You saw the iron and clay mixed together. <sup>43b</sup>In this way the people of the fourth kingdom will be mixed together. <sup>43d</sup>But iron cannot stick to clay. <sup>43c</sup>And in this way the people will not be united.</p></blockquote></div>",

Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002044\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002045\"><h3>Paragraph 2:44–2:45</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph introduces the new topic of a fifth kingdom.

Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>During the time when those kings ruled</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The author did not say how long a period this was. It is best not to be specific.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those kings:</strong> Daniel did not say who these <em>kings</em> were. In this chapter he has only mentioned Nebuchadnezzar, who was the king of the first kingdom. Scholars disagree as to who these kings were. Some think that it refers to the kings who ruled during the last kingdom, the kingdom represented by the feet and toes. While this may be true, it is recommended that you translate this in a general way, without saying to which kings Daniel was referring. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those rulers (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the God of heaven will set up a kingdom:</strong> God will cause another kingdom to rise or become powerful. Use the expression that is natural in your language.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but will completely destroy all those empires (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it will crush all these kingdoms into nothingness (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>It:</strong> This pronoun refers to the new kingdom that God will establish.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all these kingdoms:</strong> Daniel does not specifically say which kingdoms. It probably refers in a general way to all human kingdoms, including the four kingdoms represented by the four metals, and all other kingdoms in existence.

You should not make this explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without human hands:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>without human hands</em> is literally “not by hands” (NJPS). The phrase indicates that a human being did not do this. It implies that a supernatural being cut the rock from the mountain. See the Notes at 2:34a. Translate here as you did there.

(GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the great God:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>God</em> can refer to a pagan god or the God of Israel. In this context, Daniel refers to the God of Israel. The BSB has supplied the definite article <em>the</em>. You should supply it if that gives the correct meaning, that there is one God, and he is great. It is important to make sure that your translation does not imply that there is another God who is not great.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>great:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>great</em> here is a title of respect for God and indicates that he is <em>great</em> in <u>power</u>. It is the same adjective that is used to describe an earthly king in 2:10b. In your translation, use a word that is appropriate for speaking highly of God’s power. It need not be the same word that you used to describe a human king. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>mighty (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has told the king:</strong> God had informed the king, through his dream, of future events. Use a verb that is appropriate for revealing information indirectly, such as through a dream. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has let the king know</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Daniel addressed the king in the third person in order to show respect. If this is not natural in your language, you can use the second person. If your language has a special way to show respect to someone who has a higher status, you should use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has shown your Majesty (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has revealed to you, sir</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what will happen in the future:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the future</em> is more literally “after this.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what will happen in the future (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what will happen (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>future events</p></blockquote><h4>2:45d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:45d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have told you the truth about your dream, and you can trust the interpretation.”</p></li><li><p>This was your<sup>(sing)</sup> dream, and I have interpreted it correctly/accurately.”</p></li><li><p>This is exactly what you dreamed, and I have explained to you<sup>(sing)</sup> its true meaning.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The dream is true:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>true</em> means “sure, certain.” There are two ways to interpret the clause that the BSB translates as <em>The dream is true</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God had sent the dream and it gave an accurate description of future events.

He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002046\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002047\"><h3>Paragraph 2:46–2:47</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The king was deeply impressed that Daniel could tell him his dream. He honored him and his friends with high positions in the government of Babylon.</p></div><h4>2:46a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:46a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>At this, King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, paid homage to Daniel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down low <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before Daniel</span> with his face to the ground and honored Daniel.</p></li><li><p>¶ At this King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down low to the ground to show respect to Daniel.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>At this, King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>fell on his face</em> indicates that the king bowed face down to the ground in front of Daniel. This was a gesture of great respect. Make sure that your readers understand this. The king did not fall over accidentally. In some languages it may be possible to avoid this wrong meaning by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down with his face to the ground (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed to the ground (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>paid homage to Daniel:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>paid homage</em> here indicates that Nebuchadnezzar honored Daniel as God’s representative. The same word is sometimes used of venerating a god. It describes an attitude of submission and respect to a superior being. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king honored him (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:46b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:46b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and ordered that an offering of incense be presented to him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He commanded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his servants</span> to offer a sacrifice of grain and an offering of incense to Daniel.</p></li><li><p>He ordered his workers to offer a grain offering to Daniel and to burn sweet smelling perfume for him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and ordered that an offering of incense be presented to him:</strong> King Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to his servants to honor Daniel as the representative of God. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and gave orders for sacrifices and offerings to be made to Daniel (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then he gave orders for incense to be burned and a sacrifice offered in honor of Daniel (similar to CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>offering:</strong> An offering is a gift that is given to a deity. This could have been a grain offering or an animal offering. It is best to leave this general, as the BSB has done. See the KBT for how to translate the term “offering.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sacrifice (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>incense:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>incense</em> here probably refers to a substance that people burn in order to produce a sweet smell and please or honor a deity. If <em>incense</em> is not known in your culture, it may help to make this clear by following the NLT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sweet incense (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be presented to him:</strong> The verb <em>be presented</em> is passive. In some languages it may be more natural to use an active verb. In those languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that Nebuchadnezzar gave this order to his servants, probably men. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he commanded his people to offer sacrifices and burn sweet incense before him (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:46b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the king’s command as direct speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king commanded, “An offering and incense are to be presented to Daniel.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He gave this command to his servants: “Offer a sacrifice to Daniel and burn incense in his presence.”</p></blockquote></div>",

You can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he declared</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king exclaimed</p></blockquote><h4>2:47b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:47b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Your God is truly the God of gods</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Your<sup>(sing)</sup> God is truly the greatest of all gods.</p></li><li><p>“It is certain that the God you<sup>(sing)</sup> worship must be greater than all other gods.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:47b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your God is truly the God of gods and Lord of kings:</strong> This verse is the climax of the chapter. If your language has a special way to mark the climax of a story, you should use that here. Try to add emphasis in a way that is natural to your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wow! So your God is <u>indeed</u> the God of gods and the Lord of kings!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your God is truly the God of gods:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar probably believed that there were many gods. He proclaimed that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest one. See how you translated the phrase <em>God of gods</em> in Deuteronomy 10:17. In that context, however, the speaker/writer did not believe in many gods, so you may need to use a different expression here.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Your God:</strong> In some languages it is not possible to use a possessive pronoun with God. You may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the God you worship</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the God you serve</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God of gods:</strong> In this context, the expression is a superlative.

It introduces and emphasizes a positive assertion.

It introduces his reason for concluding that God was the greatest God, the Lord of kings, and the one who reveals mysteries. Indicate this connection in a way that is natural in your language. See the General Comment on 2:47a–d below. Other ways to translate this clause include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because he gave you the power to explain this mystery (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I know this because you have been able to explain this mystery (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this mystery:</strong> The phrase <em>this mystery</em> here refers to the king’s dream and its meaning.

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one section and to give each section a separate heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The BSB has four sections.</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream (2:1–13)</p></li><li><p>The Dream Revealed to Daniel (2:14–23)</p></li><li><p>Daniel Interprets the Dream (2:24–45)</p></li><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar Promotes Daniel (2:46–49)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>The GNT has three sections:</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (2:1–13)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(b) God shows Daniel what the dream means (2:14–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">(c) Daniel tells the king the dream and explains it (2:24–49)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section tells how Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream. He asked his advisers to tell him what he had dreamed and its meaning. They were unable to do so, and the king threatened them with death. But God revealed the meaning of the dream to Daniel. Daniel then told the king what he had dreamed and what it meant. The king honored Daniel and Daniel’s God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The climax of this narrative occurs in 2:47. There the king declared that the God whom Daniel worshiped was the greatest of all gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Lists</u>: The author of the book of Daniel liked to use lists (2:2, 10). However, the author did not intend for these lists to be complete or exact. The lists usually provide examples of the types of people or things that belong in a certain group or category. The Notes will suggest options on how to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Synonyms</u>: The text often uses different terms for similar ideas. For example, there are several verbs that mean “to reveal” or “to make known.” There are three different Aramaic verbs in 2:40 that mean “crush, break to pieces.” In some languages it may be difficult or confusing to use several different words for similar ideas. The Notes will suggest how you might translate these similar words and terms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Poetry</u>: You will need to think carefully about how you will translate the poetic section in this chapter (2:20–23). Authors of Hebrew poetry usually wrote using matching pairs of lines. The relationship between these parallel lines differs. Sometimes the second line repeats the information in the first line using different words. Sometimes the second line contrasts with the first line. Hebrew poetry also has word plays, figurative speech, and alliteration. It may not always be easy to translate these literary features into your language. The Notes will suggest ways of translating the different features of Hebrew poetry. For more information about how to translate Hebrew poetry, see the <em>Bible Translation Handbook of the Psalms</em>. The poetry in 2:20–23 is a song of praise or thanksgiving. If your language has a special poetic form that fits this song, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Ambiguity</u>: In the section where Daniel interpreted the last part of the king’s dream, there are a number of ambiguous references. For example, in 2:44a Daniel referred to “those kings” without identifying who those kings were. In 2:44b Daniel spoke of “all these kingdoms.” The ambiguity may be deliberate, since the dream itself is a mystery. It will be important not to over-interpret these passages by assuming a particular historical context. The Notes will suggest several options for how to translate these verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Repetition</u>: Daniel interpreted the meaning of the first three kingdoms in a very brief way. He used many more words to describe the fourth kingdom (2:36–45). In this section he also repeated much of what was described before. In this way, Daniel emphasized the fourth kingdom as the most important. Some of the repetition in this section emphasizes specific ideas. Sometimes the repetition has another function. You will need to evaluate if this kind of repetition is natural in your language. If not, you will need to find another way to emphasize these ideas.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027002048\" data-endVerseId=\"1027002049\"><h3>Paragraph 2:48a–2:49b</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph the king rewarded Daniel for interpreting his dream.</p></div><h4>2:49a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:49a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And at Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to manage the province of Babylon,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And when Daniel asked him, the king put Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the administration/government of the province of Babylon.</p></li><li><p>Daniel then asked the king to appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to administer the affairs of the province of Babylon.

This probably indicates that they were put in charge of civil and economic affairs, working under Daniel himself. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king put Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the affairs of the province of Babylon (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king entrusted the affairs of the province of Babylon to Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be in charge of all the affairs of the province of Babylon (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to manage the province of Babylon:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to manage</em> is more literally “over the administration,” Use an expression referring to those who supervise or manage a province or region. In some languages it may be more natural to use a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to administer the province of Babylon (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to govern the province of Babylon (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the province of Babylon:</strong> The <em>province</em> included the city of Babylon. See the note on 2:48c.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:49a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to indicate the content of Daniel’s request at the beginning of 2:49a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel asked the king to make Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego administrators of the province of Babylon. The king did as/what Daniel asked.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:49b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:49b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>while Daniel remained in the king’s court.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But Daniel himself served the king at the royal court.</p></li><li><p>But Daniel continued <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to work</span> in the imperial court <span data-bnType=\"implied\">itself</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">near the king</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>while Daniel remained in the king’s court:</strong> The Aramaic more literally says, “but Daniel in the gate of the king.” The verb is implied in the Aramaic. In contrast to his three friends, Daniel stayed in the city of Babylon, where he served the king at the palace gate. You can also say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but Daniel remained as an official at the royal court</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But Daniel stayed as a palace official in the king’s court</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the king’s court:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the king’s court</em> is more literally “the gate/door of the king.” This phrase implies that Daniel remained close to the king. He was ready to advise him at all times, while his friends went out to administer the province. Check that your translation implies that Daniel held an especially honored position near the king.

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3. The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003003\"><h3>Paragraph 3:1a–3:3b</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Several years may have passed since the events in chapter two. In some languages it may be necessary to introduce the story with a general remark of when the story began. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After some time…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Later…</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">One day</span> King Nebuchadnezzar had a statue made from gold,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Some time later</span> King Nebuchadnezzar ordered his servants to build a golden column.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue:</strong> The king did not make the image himself. He commanded his workers to do it. If this is not clear, you may have to add implied information. Ways to translate this idea in English include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar had a gold statue made (GNT) -</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar ordered <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his servants</span> to build a gold statue.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar caused a golden statue to be made/built.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>King Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>King Nebuchadnezzar</em> is literally “Nebuchadnezzar the king.” Use the word order that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a golden statue:</strong> The phrase <em>a golden statue</em> indicates that the statue was made from gold. It was probably not solid gold. The workers more likely made it of stone or wood and covered it with a layer of gold.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>statue:</strong> The dimensions of the object resemble a column or pillar. It is uncertain, however, what the <em>statue</em> or column represented. There are at least two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The image represented the king. Assyrian kings set up statues of themselves as symbols of their power. Following this interpretation, the image in Daniel 3 relates back to the image in King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream in chapter 2.</p></li><li><p>The image represented the king’s god.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lucas, p. 88. This view is supported by 3:12, 14, 18 (“who…have refused to serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.”). Herodotus (1:183) describes a statue of Bel in Babylon made of 800 talents of gold (22 tons). It was 12 cubits high.</span></span> The king may have wanted to unify his country under one religion. He commanded everyone to bow down and worship his god.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both (1) and (2) may be true. People may have considered the king and a particular god to be closely associated with each other. It is probably best not to be too specific.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word that the BSB translates as <em>statue</em> is the same word that described the statue in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream in Daniel 2. However, the shape of the object implies that it did not have the same form. This was not a statue according to the usual English meaning of the word—the representation of a human figure. The dimensions of the object describe a tall pillar or column. It may have been a tall, four-sided pillar tapering toward the top, shaped like a pyramid.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is sometimes called an obelisk. Another possibility is that it was a stele, a standing stone containing an inscription or design in bas-relief.</span></span> It may have been a column with a sculpture of a person on the top. Since we do not know for sure, use an expression that refers in a general way to this type of object.</p><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>sixty cubits high and six cubits wide,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>a statue ninety feet high and nine feet wide.</p></li><li><p>It was thirty meters high and three meters wide.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sixty cubits high and six cubits wide:</strong> These are the dimensions of the image, its size. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was ninety feet high and nine feet wide.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sixty cubits high:</strong> A cubit was an ancient unit of measurement. It was based on the length of a man’s forearm from his finger tips to his elbow, about 500 millimeters. Sixty cubits is about thirty meters. It is good to use modern units of measurement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>thirty meters high</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ninety feet high (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should use a measure that people in your language normally use to measure a tall object like this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and six cubits wide:</strong> This phrase refers to the distance from one side of the image to the other. You can translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>three meters wide</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>nine feet wide (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Again, you should use the measure that people in your culture normally use to measure the width of an object like this.</p><h4>3:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The king had this statue placed/erected in the plain called Dura, which was in the province of Babylon.</p></li><li><p>They built the column in the valley called Dura.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he had it set up (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on the plain of Dura:</strong> The word <em>plain</em> refers to a broad expanse of flat land. In some languages this term contrasts with hilly or mountainous regions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Dura:</strong> The name of the plain was <em>Dura</em>. People probably named the plain after a nearby city or a place called Dura. Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Dura Valley (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the plain called Dura</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the province of Babylon:</strong> The king had divided the empire into provinces. Each province had a governor, who administered the province for the king. In this context, <em>the province</em> included the capital city of Babylon. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the province that included the city of Babylon</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Babylon province</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your country may have a different word for this unit of government. Some nations have “states.” Others have “regions.” Use a word in your language that most naturally corresponds to a province. In some languages it may be necessary to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>near the city of Babylon (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>near the area of Babylon</p></blockquote>",

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3. The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003003\"><h3>Paragraph 3:1a–3:3b</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Several years may have passed since the events in chapter two. In some languages it may be necessary to introduce the story with a general remark of when the story began. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After some time…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Later…</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then he sent messages to the provincial rulers/governors, magistrates, and assistant governors/rulers, and to the advisers/counselors, treasurers, judges, officers, and all the other leading men in/of the provinces, commanding/telling them</p></li><li><p>The king then summoned the provincial leaders/rulers, the governors, magistrates, and assistant governors. He also summoned all the other provincial officials. He said to them,</p></li><li><p>Then the king sent messengers to the officials in each of the provinces. This included the governors, magistrates, and assistant governors, as well as the advisers, treasurers, judges, and law officers, and all the other rulers of the province.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar sent messages to all his officials, telling them to gather together.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Then:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>Then</em> here introduces the next event in the story.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>King Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> See the Notes at 3:1a. Once again the literal word order is “Nebuchadnezzar the king” (KJV). Use the word order that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sent word to assemble:</strong> The king sent a message to his officials. He told them to assemble together near the statue. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sent for (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>called for (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sent messengers to assemble (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he sent messages to (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gave orders for all his officials to come together (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the satraps, prefects, governors:</strong> The Aramaic text includes a connector between the words <em>prefects</em> and <em>governors</em>. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the satraps, the prefects, and the governors (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The presence of this connector groups the first three officials together. These three officials may have had a higher rank than the four officials that follow.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>satraps:</strong> Satraps were in charge of the provinces of the Persian empire. This official was probably the most important one on the list. You may:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>translate the function of the “satrap”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the provincial governor</p></blockquote></li><li><p>use a general term for an important official:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>princes (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>leaders (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>transliterate the Greek term “satrap” (NRSV). However, most people will not be familiar with this term, and you would probably want to include a footnote explaining the function of a satrap.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>prefects:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>prefects</em> refers to another high official. The exact role of a “prefect” is not known for certain. Ways to interpret this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>magistrates (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>advisers (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>governors:</strong> Again, the exact function of these officials is uncertain. They were possibly men who administered subdivisions of the provinces. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>lieutenant governors (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>assistant governors (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates:</strong> The Aramaic text groups these four titles together. Connect them in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>as well as</u> the counselors, treasurers, judges and magistrates</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">These four officials were probably of lower in rank than the first three officials in the list.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>advisers:</strong> The exact meaning of this title is uncertain. It is probable that it refers to officials who counseled or advised the higher officials. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>counselors (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>elders<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>commissioners (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>treasurers:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>treasurers</em> probably refers to officials who were responsible for keeping the king’s money safe and advising him about its use.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judges:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>judges</em> probably refers to men who heard cases and made decisions in a court of law. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>justices (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>magistrates:</strong> The exact role of these officials is uncertain. It is good to translate using a general term for officials with the power to enforce the law. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>officers (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and all the other officials of the provinces:</strong> The list was not complete. This last expression refers in general to all other governmental officials in the provinces of Babylonia. For example, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and all the rulers of the provinces (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and all the rest of the officers of the province</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:2a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The list of names includes seven types of officials. The exact work that each of these men did is uncertain and the names come from different languages.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The names of these officials are transliterations of Akkadian and Old Persian terms. Goldingay (p. 65) notes that as such they do not all belong to a single ranking system.</span></span> In some languages it may help to indicate the general category before the list. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the king gave orders for <u>all his officials</u> to come together—the princes, governors, lieutenant governors, commissioners, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then he called for <u>the leaders</u>: the governors, assistant governors, captains of the soldiers, people who advised the king, keepers of the treasury, judges, rulers, and all other officers in his kingdom. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The author did not intend the list to be a complete or exact list of all the different people who attended the ceremony. Your language may not have as many different names for officials. In that case, you may give a shortened but more general list of names. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he commanded his governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, and his other officials to come from everywhere in his kingdom (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to come to dedicate the statue he had set up.</p></li><li><p>“You<sup>(plur)</sup> must attend a ceremony to celebrate the start of the worship of the image I have erected.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The king ordered them</span> to come to a special ceremony where they would begin to worship the golden column.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up:</strong> The king told his officials to come to a ceremony to begin the worship of the image. This ceremony would honor the image and celebrate the beginning of its worship. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to attend the dedication of the statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to attend the dedication of the statue that he had erected (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to dedicate the statue he had set up (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the dedication of the statue:</strong> The phrase <em>the dedication of the statue</em> refers to a ceremony that honored the image. At this ceremony people were to start worshiping the image. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the celebration to begin the worship of the image</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he had set up:</strong> See the Notes at 3:1c. The Aramaic text repeats the phrase <em>set up</em> several times. This repetition emphasizes the authority of the king. In some languages it may not be natural to repeat this information. If that is true in your language, you may not have to repeat it here, since it is implied from 3:1c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the dedication of the statue (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, you should translate in a way that emphasizes the king’s power and authority.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:2a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the king’s command as direct speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the king sent a command to all the satraps, prefects, and governors, as well as all the advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and the rest of the provincial officials. He said, “Come to the dedication of the image that I have set up.”</p></blockquote></div>",

In some languages it may be necessary to introduce the story with a general remark of when the story began. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After some time…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Later…</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So the provincial governors, magistrates and the assistant governors came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the plain called Dura</span>.

Introduce this next action in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled:</strong> All the officials gathered together, as the king had commanded them. See the notes on 3:2a for ways to translate the titles of the various officials.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The repetition of the titles here emphasizes the importance of the ceremony. The dedication of the image was to be formal and solemn. If this use of repetition is not natural in your language, you may be able to use a shorter form here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When all these officials had arrived (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So all of them came (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not repeat all the information, you should still try to emphasize the formality and importance of the ceremony.</p><h4>3:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to dedicate the statue that the king had set up.</p></li><li><p>in order to celebrate the worship of the golden column.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up:</strong> This verse part indicates the purpose of the gathering. See the Notes at 3:2b. In some languages it may again be natural to translate the noun phrase <em>the dedication</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to dedicate the statue he had set up (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The repetition of so much information from 3:2b may be heavy and unnatural in some languages. It may be more natural to leave some of the information implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for the dedication (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they stood before it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All the officials stood and faced the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p></li><li><p>They all gathered around the golden column.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and they stood before it:</strong> The BSB is using the pronoun <em>it</em> in place of a phrase in the Aramaic text that is literally “the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.” Some English versions translate this full phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and stood in front of the statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This repetition emphasizes the power and authority of the king. However, in some languages such repetition may be heavy, confusing, or unnatural. If this is true in your language, you may leave this clause implied, as the BSB and several other English versions have done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They stood in front of the statue (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and stood in front of it (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:3</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate 3:3c as the introduction to the action of 3:4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3a</sup>So the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces, assembled <sup>3b</sup>for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <sup>3c</sup>When they were standing before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar had set up,… (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you choose to translate in this way, 3:4 will not begin a new paragraph.</p></div>",

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3. The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003004\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003006\"><h3>Paragraph 3:4–6</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The king’s herald announced that everyone present must bow down before the image of gold.

It introduces the danger that threatened God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the herald loudly proclaimed:</strong> A <em>herald</em> was a man who announced messages for the king. He stood before a crowd of people and announced these messages with a loud voice. This was his responsibility. It is important that your readers understand that <em>the herald</em> was giving a royal message, not speaking his own ideas. In some languages it may help to make this clear by following the NCV and saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the man who made announcements for the king said in a loud voice (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the herald:</strong> There were probably several heralds in the king’s service. This particular <em>herald</em> has not been mentioned before, so in some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a herald (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>loudly proclaimed:</strong> The phrase <em>loudly proclaimed</em> describes the normal way in which a herald would deliver the king’s messages to the people. Other ways English versions translate this expression are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>called out loudly (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>shouted out (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>announced in a loud voice (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made a loud proclamation (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>3:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“O people of every nation and language, this is what you are commanded:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“The king commands you<sup>(plur)</sup> who belong to every race, and to every nation, and who speak every language,</p></li><li><p>“People of every province, nation, and language!

His words are more literally “Nations, peoples, and languages.” This is figurative language. It indicates that the herald addressed many different groups of people, people who were from different nations and who spoke many different languages. You should translate in a way that is natural in your language for a person who speaks to a large audience. For example, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People of every province, nation and language! (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People of all nations, races, and languages! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You, people from all tribes and nations and language-groups, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give me your attention</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this is what you are commanded:</strong> This clause introduces the king’s command. The Aramaic uses the form “they are commanding you” and the BSB translates it as a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active clause, you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king commands you…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>listen to the king’s command! (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:4</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the word order in the clause and follow the Aramaic order.

Jones, “Musical Instruments in the Bible,” <em>The Bible Translator</em> (January 1986) 101–116; (January 1987): 129–143. The author gives pictures of some of these instruments. The <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em> also has pictures of instruments.</span></span> If that is true in your language, you may need to borrow names from the national language or translate a shorter list of names. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Trumpets, flutes, harps, and all other kinds of musical instruments… (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all kinds of wind instruments and stringed instruments</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trumpets and harps, large and small</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>As soon as you hear the sound:</strong> The phrase <em>As soon as you hear the sound</em> refers to the moment when the instruments would start playing. Other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when you hear the sound (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the moment you hear the sound of (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when the music begins</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>horn:</strong> This is a general word for any kind of horn. In this passage the word probably refers to a metal or clay trumpet. A person would hold the trumpet to their mouth and blow into it to make a sound. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trumpets (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>flute:</strong> This was also some type of a wind instrument. It is uncertain what it looked like. Other possible ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pipe (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>oboes (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>zither:</strong> A <em>zither</em> is a stringed instrument with thirty or forty strings stretched across a flat soundboard. People played it with a small thin piece of metal. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>zither</em> probably refers to this or a similar stringed instrument. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>lyre (RSV/NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>harp (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lyre:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>lyre</em> also refers to a stringed instrument, probably a kind of small triangular harp. You may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>small harp</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>harp:</strong> Scholars differ in the way they interpret what kind of harp this was. It was probably a large angular harp. People held it horizontally and played it by beating on the strings with sticks. You can translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>large harp</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pipes:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>pipes</em> probably refers to another type of musical instrument. However, scholars are not sure whether it was a type of drum, pipe, or stringed instrument. English versions make various choices. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>drum (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you use a word referring to a musical instrument well known in your culture. Or you may leave it untranslated, as it is included in the following phrase “all kinds of music.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and all kinds of music:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>all kinds of music</em> here probably refers to all different types of musical instruments. This was probably a summary phrase that referred to all kinds of instruments. It referred even to those instruments that the herald had not specifically mentioned (3:2b). You could translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>at the same time with all other kinds of instruments (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and other instruments (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and then all the other instruments will join in (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:5a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse: For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Trumpets, flutes…. will soon start playing.

People in the ancient Near East usually bowed down with their face to the ground when they worshiped a god. Nebuchadnezzar was commanding his officials to honor the image as a god. In some languages it may be natural to indicate this by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you must bow down and worship (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bow to the ground to worship (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the form of command that is most natural for a king to use to his subjects.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and worship:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>worship</em> here means to give great honor and respect, as to a god. The king wanted the officials to worship the statue. However, the text does not say that</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the golden statue:</strong> See the Notes at 3:1a. Use the same phrase here that you used there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up:</strong> The repetition of this phrase emphasizes the authority of the king (see 3:1c, 2b, 3b).

However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2.

The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural.

There are different ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>you may supply the object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and anyone who does not bow down and worship <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the statue</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>you may use a different expression to avoid repeating the same information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Anyone who refuses to obey (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And whoever does not:</strong> There are different ways to translate this general subject.

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bow to the ground to worship (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will immediately be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace:</strong> The punishment for refusing to worship the image was death by fire. This is a passive clause. The king’s men would push or drop the disobedient person through an opening down into the furnace. The person being punished would fall into the fire and die. If it is more natural in your language to use an active clause, you may translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using an indefinite subject</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will throw him into a furnace that burns hotly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will cause him to fall into a fiery furnace</p></blockquote></li><li><p>supplying the subject, the king’s soldiers or the king’s men</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king’s soldiers will push/drop that person into the furnace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king will command his servants to throw that person into the furnace</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blazing fiery:</strong> The author literally describes the furnace as a <em>blazing fiery</em> furnace, as in the BSB. The author probably used these two adjectives in order to emphasize the intensity of the fire. You may use one or two expressions, whichever is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a furnace where the fire burns intensely</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a furnace of blazing fire (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a red-hot blazing furnace<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>ft Goldingay</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a flaming furnace (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>furnace:</strong> Scholars differ in the way they describe the shape and function of this <em>furnace</em>. It was probably a large oven, like those where Babylonians would bake bricks. It probably had a door at the top (3:21–23) and another opening in the side (3:25). Archeologists have discovered large brick kilns like this outside the city of Babylon.</p>",

The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them.

The officials obeyed the king’s command. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as soon as all the people heard:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates <em>as soon as all the people heard</em> is more literally “as soon as all the peoples heard.” You can also translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when they heard</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At the moment when everyone heard</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of music:</strong> See the Notes at 3:5a for ways to translate these musical instruments. Translate them here the same way you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There is a textual problem in this verse. A few Aramaic manuscripts include a sixth type of musical instrument. There are two options:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Follow the Masoretic Text and do not translate the sixth instrument. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sounds of the horns, flutes, lyres, zithers, pipes, and all the other musical instruments (NCV) <em>(BSB, KJV, GW, REB, NCV, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Include the sixth instrument. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sound of horn, pipe, lyre, zither, harp, bagpipe and all the other instruments (NJB) <em>(RSV/NRSV, NASB, ESV, NLT, NJB, NJPS, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the Masoretic Text and option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse the author repeated most of the instruments in the previous lists. This slows and increases the tension in the narrative. In some languages this type of repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you may not have to translate all the instruments. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so, as soon as they heard the sound of the instruments (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As soon as the people heard the music (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hearing the sound of the whole great orchestra playing</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you do not translate all the instruments in the list, you should try to communicate the tension in the narrative in another way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and all kinds of music:</strong> See the Notes on this phrase at 3:5a.</p><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the people of every nation and language would fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>all the people from every nation and people and language bowed down and worshiped the golden statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p></li><li><p>they all bowed to the ground—men from every nation and people, men who spoke every language—and they worshiped the golden column the king had set up.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the people of every nation and language:</strong> See the Notes at 3:4. Translate in a similar way here as you did there. The author repeated this phrase to emphasize the formality and seriousness of the ceremony. If it is not natural in your language to repeat this information here, you may be able to use the third person plural pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you do this, you should try to keep the same tone of formality.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>would fall down and worship the golden statue:</strong> See the Notes at 3:5b. In your translation it should be clear that the officials chose to bow down to the ground to honor the image. Your readers should not think that they accidentally fell over. You may translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bowed down and worshiped the gold statue (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bowed to the ground and worshiped the gold statue (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up:</strong> This clause is repeated several times in this passage (see also in 3:1c, 3:2b, 3:3b, 3:5b). This repetition emphasizes the authority of the king. In some languages it may be natural to shorten the reference to Nebuchadnezzar. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that the king had set up (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:7a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Aramaic text, the subject of the clause in 3:7a is “all the people.” The subject in 3:7b is “the people of every nation and language.” These two phrases both refer to the officials who were gathered in front of the statue. In some languages it may be natural to make this clear by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup>And all the people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gathered there</span> from every nation and language heard the sound of the different musical instruments playing <sup>7b</sup>and bowed down and worshiped the golden statue that the king had set up.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>And all the people from every nation and language bowed to the ground to worship the king’s golden statue <sup>7a</sup>as soon as they heard the music—the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, and harp and other instruments all playing together</p></blockquote></div>",

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They addressed King Nebuchadnezzar (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should communicate that the Chaldeans were about to announce something important.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O king, may you live forever!:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>O king, may you live forever</em> is more literally “O king, live forever!” This is a figure of speech that means the Chaldeans wished the king a long and healthy life. This was a common and respectful way people greeted a king at that time. There are different ways to say this in English. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May you, our king, live a long and healthy life!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Long live the king!

The BSB has translated this literally. The officials wanted to emphasize that the crime was a personal offense against the king. The three men had disobeyed the king himself. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language and shows respect for Nebuchadnezzar as the king. See the Notes at 2:4a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have issued a decree:</strong> A <em>decree</em> is like a law. In that time, the king’s decrees became the law for all the people in the land.

See how you translate the decree itself in 3:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>everyone:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>everyone</em> is literally “every man.” In this context, most of the officials who attended the ceremony were probably men. However, the command did not exclude women, as a literal translation might suggest. It may be good to use a general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the people (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music:</strong> See the Notes at 3:5a and 3:7a for the musical instruments. This is the third time the author lists the names of the instruments. This repetition emphasizes how formal and serious this ceremony was. In some languages this type of repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you may be able to use a summary clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as soon as the music starts (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when the music played (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, if you give a summary of the instruments, you should try to emphasize the large number and variety of instruments in another way.</p><h4>3:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>must fall down and worship the golden statue,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>should bow down and worship the golden image.</p></li><li><p>is to bow down and worship the golden column.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>must fall down and worship the golden statue:</strong> See the Notes at 3:5b.

These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up.

See how you translated <em>Jews</em> in 3:8.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar had given these Jewish men important positions in the government of the province.

Some other ways to translate this idea using a verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[you appointed] to govern the province of Babylon (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[you appointed] to administer the province of Babylon (NJPS)</p></blockquote><h4>3:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And these men,</span> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:</strong> See the Notes at 1:7a–b The author repeated these names twelve times in the chapter.

However, early versions and English versions differ as to whether the word <em>gods</em> should be understood as singular or plural:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the Aramaic gods in general.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your god (GNT) <em>(NJPS, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) and the majority of English versions.

The second accusation is more specific than the first. English versions translate the connector in different ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They <u>do not</u>…<u>and</u> they <u>do not</u>… (NRSV, NCV, similarly the NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They <u>do not</u> worship…<u>or</u> bow down (GNT, similarly GW, NLT, NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or worship the golden statue you have set up:</strong> See the Notes at 3:5b. Most versions translate the verb as <em>worship</em>. The author used this verb together with the synonym “to serve” in 3:12, 14, 18, 28. If your language has only one verb that means <em>worship</em>, you may use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, refuse to worship your gods and the statue you have set up (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you have set up:</strong> The phrase <em>set up</em> is repeated in 3:1c, 2b, 3b, 5b, 7, 14, 18. This repetition emphasizes the authority of the king. You should translate this clause here.</p>",

Used together they emphasize the idea and describe a person who became <u>very</u> angry. There are two ways you can translate this expression:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>combine the words into one emphatic idea.

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3. The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003013\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003015\"><h3>Paragraph 3:13a–15c</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph the king threatened and rebuked Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

The phrase is literally, “Nebuchadnezzar answered and saying to them.” Nebuchadnezzar was about to ask them something important. The context is that of a confrontation. Introduce the king’s angry words in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar asked them (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then King Nebuchadnezzar questioned/interrogated them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar demanded</p></blockquote><h4>3:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you do not serve my gods</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego!

In some languages it may be natural to put the names first in the sentence, as the BSB and some other English versions have done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is it true:</strong> The Aramaic question that the BSB translates as <em>is it true</em> probably means “Is it a fact?” The king had heard that the three Jewish men had refused to bow down. He wanted to hear from the men themselves to be sure that it was not a false accusation. The CEV makes this clear by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I hear that you refuse to worship my gods and the gold statue I have set up (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that you do not serve my gods:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>serve</em> here means “worship, honor.” See the Notes at 3:12d. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you refuse to worship my gods (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my gods:</strong> See the Notes at 3:12d. Use the same word for <em>gods</em> here that you did there.</p><h4>3:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or worship the golden statue I have set up?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And do you<sup>(plur)</sup> refuse to worship the golden statue, which I have set up?</p></li><li><p>And will you<sup>(plur)</sup> not bow before the golden column that I have caused/ordered to be erected?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or:</strong> See the Notes at 3:12e.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>worship the golden statue I have set up?:</strong> See the Notes at 3:5b. The king asked a second question. This is probably a slightly different question. The king wanted to know if the Jewish men had deliberately acted against his authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I have set up:</strong> The phrase <em>set up</em> is repeated in 3:1c, 2b, 3b, 5b, 7, 14, 18. This repetition emphasizes the authority of the king.</p>",

Use a form in your language that shows that this new clause contrasts with the previous clause.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you refuse to worship:</strong> See the Notes at 3:6 . In the Aramaic text the verb does not have an object. Some English versions supply the pronoun “it” referring to the statue.

This is a passive clause.

The implied answer is “no one” or “none.” This question functions as an emphatic statement. Nebuchadnezzar was claiming that no god could rescue the Jewish men from the furnace.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways you can translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you think there is any god who can save you? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now, who is that god who can rescue you from my power? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a question with the answer supplied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is there any god who can save you from me? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">No!</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No god can save you from me. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this emphatic statement in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>god:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>god</em> can refer to a pagan god or to the one true God. Here it refers to any of the pagan gods. King Nebuchadnezzar believed that there were many gods. The king did not think that any of them could rescue the three men from the fiery furnace.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from my hands?:</strong> In this context, the word <em>hands</em> is an idiom that refers to the king’s power or authority. There are three ways to translate this idiom:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What God can save you from my power then?

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3. The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003016\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003018\"><h3>Paragraph 3:16–18</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the three men responded to the king. The paragraph does not begin with a connector. However, the relation between the two paragraphs (3:13–15; 3:16–18) is one of contrast. If you have a natural way of showing this in your language, you can use it here. For example, in English you could begin the paragraph with the connector “But…”</p></div><h4>3:16a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:</strong> The author repeated these names twelve times in the chapter. If it is not natural to repeat the names here, you can use a phrase that clearly refers to these three individuals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The three men (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar…”:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar</em> is more literally “answered and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar.” The BSB has translated the words <em>O Nebuchadnezzar</em> as part of the men’s speech, indicating whom they were addressing. Consider what is the most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>replied to King Nebuchadnezzar (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>answered the king, saying, “Nebuchadnezzar,…” (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>answered, “Your Majesty,…” (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have no need to answer you in this matter:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to answer you in this matter</em> is more literally “give back a word to you.” The three men did not feel any need to explain their action to the king. They implied that they were responsible to God for their actions, not to the king. And God himself would show the answer to the king’s question. In some languages it may be possible to imply this by placing the emphasis on the words <em>to…you</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>It is not to you</u> that we need to answer concerning this matter</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have no need to present a defense to you in this matter (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We do not need to give you a reply concerning this (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your question needs no answer from us (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>3:16</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we<sup>(excl)</sup> do not need to defend what we did.</p></li><li><p>¶ The three men declared, “King Nebuchadnezzar, there is no need for us<sup>(excl)</sup> to give you<sup>(sing)</sup> an answer.</p></li></ul></div>",

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3. The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003016\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003018\"><h3>Paragraph 3:16–18</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the three men responded to the king. The paragraph does not begin with a connector. However, the relation between the two paragraphs (3:13–15; 3:16–18) is one of contrast. If you have a natural way of showing this in your language, you can use it here. For example, in English you could begin the paragraph with the connector “But…”</p></div><h4>3:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But even if He does not,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But even if he does not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">rescue/save us</span><sup>(excl)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>But even if he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">chooses/decides</span> not to do so,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a possibility that contrasts with the previous statement.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even if He does not:</strong> This conditional sentence is a short way to say “even if our God does not deliver us from the furnace.” In some languages it may be natural to include some of this implied information.

This is a passive clause. If an active clause is more natural in your language, you may follow the NIV or the NLT, which say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we want to make it clear to you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we want you to know (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to make the king the subject of the verb.

The statement is emphatic. Emphasize the men’s refusal in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we will never serve your gods (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gods:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>gods</em> is plural, as in 3:12d.

In some languages it may be natural to translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>worship the golden statue you have set up:</strong> See the Notes at 3:5b, 3:12e, and translate here in the same or a similar way.</p>",

If it is unnatural to repeat these three names, you may leave this phrase untranslated, as it is implied by the context.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19a</sup>Nebuchadnezzar’s face twisted as he raged against the three men.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19a</sup>His face distorted with anger, Nebuchadnezzar….</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He commanded that the furnace be made seven times hotter than it usually was.</p></li><li><p>he commanded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his men</span> to heat the furnace up to its maximum/greatest possible temperature.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He gave orders:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>gave orders</em> is literally “answered and saying.” In this context, the expression emphasizes what the king was about to say. See the Notes at 2:5a; 3:9. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He commanded (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to heat the furnace:</strong> Other ways to translate this using an active verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he commanded them (indefinite) to heat the furnace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he ordered <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his soldiers/workers</span> to heat the furnace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>furnace:</strong> See the Notes on the word <em>furnace</em> at 3:6.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>seven times hotter than usual:</strong> This is probably an idiomatic or proverbial expression meaning “much hotter.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Technology at this time permitted a temperature of up to fifteen hundred degrees Celsius.

This is unexpected, since the clothes were valuable. It probably indicates that the soldiers were working quickly. It may be natural to imply this by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>these men, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still</span> wearing their robes….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they were tied up:</strong> This is a passive clause.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>robes (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>turbans:</strong> Most English versions agree that the Aramaic word refers to a piece of clothing that men wore on their heads. If you have a general word for something a man wears on the head, you can use it here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>hats (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>headgear (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>and other clothes:</strong> This is a general expression that includes all sorts of other clothing a man would normally wear, such as shoes and belts.

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading.

As a result, some translations, including the BSB, introduce the clause with a connector that shows contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But suddenly (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a form that is natural in your language for introducing a sudden change in the action of a story.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement:</strong> This is more literally “was amazed and stood up quickly.” The king was probably sitting on his throne watching the celebrations. He saw something that surprised him and caused him to stand up quickly. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up quickly (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar was startled.

Introduce the king’s reaction to what he saw in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>exclaimed to his advisers (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>advisers:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>advisers</em> probably refers to high-ranking royal officials who advised the king. It is the same as the fifth word in the list in 3:2. Other English versions say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>officials (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>counselors (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Did we not throw three men, firmly bound, into the fire?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a statement and implies a positive answer, “yes.” The king was expecting his advisers to confirm/agree that they had tied up <u>three</u> men and thrown them into the fire. There are several ways to translate this question:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question or questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Was it not three men that we threw bound into the fire?

We threw <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> those three men into the fire, didn’t we?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement.

He ordered his guards/soldiers to tie up the Jewish men. If in your language it is not natural to use a first-person plural pronoun in this context, you may need to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I had three men bound and thrown into the fire, did I not?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How many men did I command <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my soldiers</span> to tie up and throw into the fire?

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused.

(3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3.

These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003024\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003025\"><h3>Paragraph 3:24–25</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The narrative does not directly tell what happened to the men in the furnace. Instead, the focus moves to the king. The king expressed his shock and amazement at what he saw.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Septuagint (LXX), the ancient Greek version, here adds two stories that are not in the Masoretic Text. The LXX says “the king is amazed because he hears them singing.” Like the LXX, the NJB adds “the song of Azariah in the furnace” (3:24–50) and “The song of the three young men” (3:51–90). The NJB includes these additions and then continues translating the Aramaic text at verse 91. For more information on these added texts see the introduction to the Notes. The Dead Sea Scrolls, like the Masoretic Text, do not include these additions. These Notes also do not include these sections in the Notes or the Display.</span></span></p></div><h4>3:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Look!” he exclaimed. “I see four men, unbound and unharmed, walking around in the fire—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then the king said, “But look! I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span> see four men walking around in the middle of the fire.</p></li><li><p>They are untied and none of them are hurt.</p></li><li><p>Then the king exclaimed, “But look at the fire! I can see four men walking about in it! Their hands and feet are not tied! None of them have been burnt!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Look!:</strong> The Aramaic exclamation that the BSB translates as <em>Look!</em> calls attention to something important and surprising. Here it also contrasts with the previous clause. Try to translate both ideas. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But look… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But what do I see!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he exclaimed:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>he exclaimed</em> is literally “he was answering and saying.” See the Notes at 3:9. In this context, the expression indicates that the king was about to say something surprising and unexpected. It introduces the climax of the narrative. Introduce what the king said in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He said</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar shouted (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I see four men:</strong> The king saw that there were four men in the fire. The text does not say so, but presumably everyone else could also see four men. The fourth man was actually there. So in your translation you should use the first person singular <em>I</em> without implying that the advisers could not see the same thing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I can see that there are four men</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unbound and unharmed:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar could see that the four men were walking freely and that they were not in pain or distress. There were no ropes or chains around them, and the fire was not burning or hurting them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unbound:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>unbound</em> is passive. It can also be translated as “loosed.” Here it indicates that there were no ropes/chains binding/tying the men in the furnace. In translating this, bear in mind that one of the four men had never been bound. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>loose (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are free of chains/ropes.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are not tied up. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unharmed:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>unharmed</em> is more literally “there is no hurt on them.” The fire had not burned the skin/bodies of any of the men. Different ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they show no sign of being hurt (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are not burned (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The flames have not hurt/harmed them!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>walking around in the fire:</strong> The furnace was big enough for all the men to walk around inside it. They were surrounded by flames. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>walking in the middle of the fire (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>walking about in the flames</p></blockquote><h4>3:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the fourth looks like a son of the gods!”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And the fourth person looks like a god!”</p></li><li><p>The fourth person appears divine/godlike!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the fourth looks like a son of the gods:</strong> The king described the fourth person that he saw in the furnace. This is important information. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a complete sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The fourth one looks like a son of the gods. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a son of the gods:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>a son of the gods</em> here refers to a supernatural being of some kind. Nebuchadnezzar, like the other Babylonians, believed in the existence of various gods. This fourth figure looked godlike, supernatural. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a divine being (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many scholars believe that this fourth figure may have been Jesus Christ, the Son of God, appearing as a man before his birth on earth. However, you should not make this explicit in the text. This was not what Nebuchadnezzar thought.</p>",

For example, it was used by Melchizedek (Genesis 14:18–20), Balaam (Numbers 24:16), and the king of Babylon (Isaiah 14:14). It was used by a Jew in Daniel 4:21–29; 5:15, 21; 7:18–27; Genesis 14:22; and Deuteronomy 32:8.</span></span> See Genesis 14:18–20, 22.

The NIV translates this phrase as “come out! Come here!” to show this emphasis, but in some languages it may not be natural to use two verbs. In that case, you could use one emphatic verb.

Scholars have debated why this might be. Possibly he was traveling somewhere else in the empire on the king’s business at this time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 3 in the Aramaic language. These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up. (3:1–7)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Problem</u>: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow down and worship the image. The king threatened to kill them, but they still refused. (3:8–18)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Action:</u> The king ordered his soldiers to throw the three young men into the furnace. (3:19–23)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Result/Outcome</u>: God delivered the three young men from the furnace, and Nebuchadnezzar gave honor to God. (3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2. Some have two headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Golden Image” (NRSV, 3:1–18)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar’s Gold Statue” (NLT, 3:1–18)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (NRSV, 3:19–30)</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Blazing Furnace” (NLT, 3:19–30)</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">3. The GNT has four headings:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“Nebuchadnezzar Commands Everyone to Worship a Gold Statue” (3:1–7)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Accused of Disobedience” (3:8–18)</p></li><li><p>“Daniel’s Three Friends Are Sentenced to Death” (3:19–25)</p></li><li><p>“The Three Men Are Released and Promoted” (3:26–30)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Translation Problems</u>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Lists: The author liked to use lists. He repeated these lists throughout the chapter. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the list of the names of officials (3:2, 3, 27)</p></li><li><p>the list of musical instruments (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>the phrase: “peoples, nations, and languages” (3:4, 29)</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Repetition: The author also liked to repeat phrases throughout the narrative. Some of these phrases are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>“the image that King Nebuchadnezzar set up” (3:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 18)</p></li><li><p>“hear the sound of the horn” (3:5, 7, 10, 15)</p></li><li><p>“fall down and worship” (3:5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15)</p></li><li><p>“burning fiery furnace” (3:6, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego” (3:12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Each language uses repetition in its own way. These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003026\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003027\"><h3>Paragraph 3:26–27</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The king went closer to the furnace and spoke directly to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The three men left the furnace, unharmed.</p></div><h4>3:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and when the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers had gathered around,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The provincial governors, magistrates, assistant governors, and the king’s advisers gathered around them,</p></li><li><p>The provincial governors, magistrates, and other royal officials crowded around <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to look at</span> the three men.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and when the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers had gathered around:</strong> See the Notes on <em>satraps, prefects</em>, and <em>governors</em> at 3:2a The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>advisers</em> is the same as the word in 3:24b. Translate it here as you did there. Notice that here a word meaning “of the king,” that is, <em>royal</em>, describes these officials.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had gathered around:</strong> The same verb is used in 3:3a, where the BSB translates it as “assembled.” It means “came together, met as a group.” Here the men gathered together informally in order to look at the men who had come out of the furnace. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gathered together (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>crowded around (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they saw/realized that the fire had not damaged/burnt their bodies.</p></li><li><p>They could not see any marks from the fire on them!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men:</strong> The officials observed that the fire had not burned the men. In some languages it may be unnatural to say that the officials saw that something had not happened. Other possible ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They could not see any burnt marks on them.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was clear/obvious to them that the men were safe/whole. The fire had not harmed them at all.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No signs of harm/burns were on them. The fire had not affected them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates <em>had no effect</em> is more literally “had not ruled over.” The author used this verb in a figurative way. He meant that the fire had not burned the three men. Other ways to translate this expression include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fire had not harmed their bodies (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men (NRSV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:27c-e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These three clauses give examples of how the fire did not harm the three Jewish men. In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here. It may also be natural to use two or three sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their hair was not singed, their clothes were not burned, and there was no smell of smoke on them. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Not a hair on their heads was singed, and their clothing was not scorched. They didn’t even smell of smoke! (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Not a hair of their heads was singed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Their hair was not burned.</p></li><li><p>The fire had not burned their hair</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Not a hair of their heads was singed:</strong> This is a passive clause. If it is more natural to use an active clause, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The fire had not singed/burnt the hair on their heads</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The hair on their heads was untouched <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by the fire</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a hair of their heads:</strong> In some languages it may be unnatural to mention that the hair involved was <em>of</em> or on the men’s <em>heads</em>. It may be more natural to leave this information implied and follow the GNT by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Their hair (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>their robes were unaffected,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The clothes that they were wearing were not damaged.</p></li><li><p>or their clothes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their robes were unaffected:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>were unaffected</em> is literally “were not changed.” In many languages it may be natural to indicate in what way the robes were not changed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their robes were not scorched (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The fire had not burned their clothes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>robes:</strong> See the Notes on <em>robes</em> at 3:21a. The exact meaning of this Aramaic word is uncertain. The author probably just chose this item of clothing as an example of something that was true of all the clothes the men were wearing. So it is good to translate it with a general word for clothing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their clothing (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:27e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:27e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and there was no smell of fire on them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The advisers could not even smell fire/smoke on them.</p></li><li><p>Nor was there any odor of smoke on them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and there was no smell of fire on them:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>there was no smell of fire on them</em> probably means that no odor of smoke came from the three men. They did not smell of smoke, as one might expect. Ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and not even the smell of fire came from them (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They did not even smell of smoke (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The officials could not even smell smoke on the three men.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Languages have different ways to describe smells. Use a natural way in your language to express the officials’ inability to smell smoke/fire on these men.</p>",

These Notes usually follow the Aramaic found in the Masoretic Text (MT). The early Greek translation of Daniel 3 is somewhat different from the Aramaic. The Greek translation includes two stories that are not in the MT. The first is called “The Prayer of Azariah” (3:24–45). The second is called “The Song of the Three Young Men” (3:50–90). These two stories are connected by a short paragraph (3:46–50). Most English versions do not include these two stories. The NJB, however, does include them. As a result the verse numbers in the NJB are different from those of most other English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some other places the Greek text of Daniel 3 differs from the Aramaic of the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek text includes a date in 3:1 that is not in the MT. Scholars have different views on why the two texts differ. It is possible that the Greek versions may have translated from a different Aramaic original. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Outline</u>: This chapter can be divided into four parts:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Setting</u>: Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his officials of Babylon to come and worship the golden image that he had set up.

(3:24–30)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The author gave prominence to Daniel 3:16–18, when the three young men proclaimed that they trusted in God to rescue them. If you have a way in your language to mark this section as important, you should use do that here</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Headings:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes interpret Daniel 3:1–30 as a one unit with one heading. However, in some languages it may be helpful to divide this chapter into more than one unit and to give each unit a separate heading. The following are some examples of how English versions divide the chapter into units and the headings they give for each unit:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have one heading. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“The Image of Gold and the Fiery Furnace” (NIV)</p></li><li><p>“The Fiery Furnace” (REB)</p></li><li><p>“Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Refuse to Worship an Idol” (GW)</p></li></ol></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">2.

These notes will discuss the significance of the repetitions in Daniel. In some languages, the repetition may not be natural. If that is true in your language, you will have to consider how best to communicate the same meaning.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027003028\" data-endVerseId=\"1027003030\"><h3>Paragraph 3:28–30</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this concluding paragraph the king praised God for the miracle that had happened, and he rewarded the three Jewish men.</p></div><h4>3:29a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:29a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore I decree that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore I now command that</p></li><li><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">today</span> I make the following law:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Nebuchadnezzar declared that the Jewish people would be free to worship their own God. The Jewish religion would be legal in the Babylonian empire. No one would persecute the Jews for worshiping their God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>Therefore</em> here introduces a result clause. Because of the way God rescued the three men, the king decided to make a new law. Introduce the king’s announcement in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And now (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I decree that:</strong> See the Notes at 3:10. The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates <em>I decree that</em> is literally “from me is set a decree.” Emphasis is on the phrase “from me.” It was the king himself who proclaimed the royal decree. Other ways English versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I order that (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I command that (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:29b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:29b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the people of any nation or language who say anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>no one may insult/disrespect the God whom Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego worship. This law applies to people from every people group and nation and every language.</p></li><li><p>No one should ever blaspheme the God that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego worship. Everyone of every tribe, nation, and language must obey this new law.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the people of any nation or language:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the people of any nation or language</em> is more literally “any people, nation, or tongue.” See the Notes at 3:4, where similar words are used. In this context this phrase refers to any individual from any group of people. This includes anyone from any nation, no matter what language they spoke. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people of every province, nation and language</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>anyone of any nation, race, or language (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>any person from any tribe or nation, speaking any language</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who say anything offensive against:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>say anything offensive against</em> refers in a general way to speaking with lack of respect. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who insults/blasphemes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who say anything slanderous about (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>speaks disrespectfully of (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:</strong> See the Notes at 3:28a. The king thought that there were many gods. He was speaking specifically of one of them, the God whom the Jewish men worshiped.</p><h4>3:29c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:29c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will be cut into pieces and their houses reduced to rubble.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If anyone disobeys, I will command my soldiers to cut their bodies into pieces and to make their houses into <span data-bnType=\"implied\">nothing but</span> piles of stones.</p></li><li><p>If someone blasphemes their God, I will have my soldiers cut off their arms and legs, and I will command my soldiers to destroy their homes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will be cut into pieces:</strong> See the Notes at 2:5c. This is a passive clause. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>shall be torn limb from limb (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will order my servants to cut/chop them up</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will command my soldiers to cut their bodies into pieces.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The kings in the Ancient Near East were often very cruel. They punished people severely if they did not obey them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and their houses reduced to rubble:</strong> The king said that the homes of those who disrespected the Jewish God would be destroyed. See the Notes at 2:5d. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his house is to be made a pile of ruins (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. If it is more natural to translate this as an active clause, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and my soldiers will destroy their homes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and my servants will utterly demolish their houses</p></blockquote><h4>3:29d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:29d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For there is no other god who can deliver in this way.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I make this decree</span> because no other god can rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> like this.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I announce this law</span> because no other divine/supernatural power is able to save <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> like their God can.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> here introduces the reason why the king made this law. People were forbidden to disrespect this God <u>because</u> he was great. He had shown his power by saving the three Jewish men. No other god could save as he had done. Connect this clause to the previous clause in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages it may be natural to leave the connection implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no other god who can rescue like this. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there is no other god who can deliver in this way:</strong> The king worshiped many gods who were really not gods at all. He declared that none of the gods he worshiped could do what the Jewish God had done. Other ways English versions translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No other god can rescue like this (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no other god has such great power to save (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be possible to speak in a general way of <em>god</em> or gods. It may be necessary to say “idol” or “power.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em>.</span></span> But if you use a word meaning “idol,” you should not say “no <u>other</u> idol,” which would imply that the Jewish God was an idol.

However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004003\"><h3>Paragraph 4:1–3</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This chapter is in the form of a royal proclamation or announcement. In this first paragraph the king introduced himself as the person who was making the proclamation. He mentioned whom he was addressing and greeted them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The king’s scribes would have written a proclamation like this on a stone or wooden slab. His servants would then have placed it where people could see and read it easily.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers in the BSB differ from the numbers in the NJB and the NJPS.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>These versions begin the account at 3:31, and the paragraph ends at 3:33.

In some languages it may therefore be natural to include a first-person reference here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> King Nebuchadnezzar, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am making this announcement.</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Nebuchadnezzar was the author, but he was probably not the actual writer. In order to make this clear, you may need to add implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the command of</span> King Nebuchadnezzar that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this proclamation</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is made/written</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the people of every nation and language:</strong> The Aramaic is more literally “to all the peoples, the nations, and the languages.” The king was addressing his proclamation to everyone on earth, whatever their language. In some languages you may need to add implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I write this to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span>, whatever their nationality, race and language</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I announce/declare this to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you people belonging to</span> every tribe, nation, and language-group</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>people:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>people</em> refers to people groups, such as tribes and ethnic groups. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>races (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nation:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>nation</em> refers to people who have a common government.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>language:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>language</em> literally means “tongues.” Here it refers to <u>people</u> speaking the different languages in the world.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who dwell in all the earth:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>earth</em> can refer to the <u>world</u> or to the <u>land</u> in the sense of the Babylonian empire. Since Nebuchadnezzar ruled most of the known world, you can translate it either way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that live in all the land (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the world (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>throughout the world (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this introduction separately and in the third person, rather than as part of the proclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar sent this message… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar sent the following letter… (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Nebuchadnezzar wrote to the people of all nations, tribes and speech in all the earth. He said:</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>May your prosperity be multiplied.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I wish you peace and prosperity.</p></li><li><p>Greetings! I wish you good health and increasing wealth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>May your prosperity be multiplied:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>May your prosperity be multiplied</em> is more literally “May your peace increase!” This expression was a standard greeting in the Babylonian culture. The idea of “peace” included both physical and material well-being, that is, both health and wealth. There are at least three ways you can translate this:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate the Aramaic greeting. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May your peace abound! (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the Aramaic greeting. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May you have abundant prosperity (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I wish you peace and prosperity (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a local greeting suitable for use in a royal proclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings! (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Peace be with/upon you!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Health and wealth be yours!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>abundant</u> prosperity</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to change the order of the information in 4:1a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>Greetings to the people of all nations, races, and languages in the world. I, King Nebuchadnezzar, <sup>1b</sup>wish you great prosperity.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1b</sup>May peace and prosperity be <sup>1a</sup>with you who dwell in all the land—all nations, races and languages! Greetings from Nebuchadnezzar the king!</p></blockquote></div>",

In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004003\"><h3>Paragraph 4:1–3</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This chapter is in the form of a royal proclamation or announcement. In this first paragraph the king introduced himself as the person who was making the proclamation. He mentioned whom he was addressing and greeted them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The king’s scribes would have written a proclamation like this on a stone or wooden slab. His servants would then have placed it where people could see and read it easily.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers in the BSB differ from the numbers in the NJB and the NJPS.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>These versions begin the account at 3:31, and the paragraph ends at 3:33. So in these versions chapter 4 does not begin until 4:4 in the BSB. 4:4 in the BSB is 4:1 in the NJB.</span></span> See the discussion in the Introduction to these Notes.</p></div><h4>4:3</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is written in poetic form. If you have a special way of indicating that this is poetic speech, you can use it here. For example, some versions indent these lines or use different kinds of type.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two pairs of parallel lines in this verse. The first part of each pair is followed by a second part that says the same thing in a different way.</p><h4>4:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>How great are His signs,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The signs he has given/performed are very great!</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I praise him for</span> his wonderful signs!</p></li><li><p>He has shown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span> amazing signs!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>How great are His signs:</strong> The king praised God for the <em>signs</em> that God had showed him. These <em>signs</em> were <em>great</em>. That is, they were very impressive or wonderful. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His wonderful acts are great (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may have a different way to express this kind of praise. It may be natural to supply a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I praise him because</span> he performs great signs</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Praise him for</span> his great miracles!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>great</em> in this context means “imposing, amazing, unusual.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>impressive (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>signs:</strong> See the Notes at 4:2. The GW says explicitly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>miraculous signs (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>4:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>how mighty His wonders!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The miracles he has done are powerful!</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I praise him for</span> his wonderful works!</p></li><li><p>He has performed mighty miracles!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how mighty His wonders!:</strong> The king praised God for the wonderful things God had done. This is very similar in meaning to 4:3a. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and his miracles are mighty (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He uses his power to do amazing things (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I praise God for</span> his powerful wonders/miracles!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mighty:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mighty</em> means “strong.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>powerful (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wonders:</strong> See the Notes at 4:2b, where the same word is used. In some languages it may be natural to use a verb here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wonderful/miraculous things he has done</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:3a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Aramaic, the repetition of ideas makes a natural poetic form suitable for songs or exclamations of praise. But in some languages it may not be natural to repeat the same idea in two different ways. If that is true in your language, you may be able to combine 4:3a–b into one clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His miracles are mighty and marvelous. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>His kingdom is an eternal kingdom;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He has authority to rule forever.</p></li><li><p>He will reign forever,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His kingdom is an eternal kingdom:</strong> The king continued to praise God. He exclaimed that God’s kingdom will last forever. God will never cease to rule as king over his people. In some languages it may be more natural to translate the idea <em>kingdom</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will rule forever (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His kingdom:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>His kingdom</em> in this context refers to God’s authority to rule. God will always have the power and authority to reign.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>eternal</em> in this context means “for limitless, unending time.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everlasting (RSV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>His dominion endures from generation to generation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He reigns over each new generation <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of people</span>.</p></li><li><p>the lord/king over us and our children and their children and all who are yet to come/live.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Aramaic text connects this verse part to the previous verse part with the common conjunction that is often translated as “and.” In this context it introduces a parallel line of poetry that says the same thing in a different way. The BSB has not translated it. Introduce this parallel line of poetry in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His dominion endures from generation to generation:</strong> This line repeats the meaning of the previous line, but with a different emphasis. Here the king emphasized that God will <u>continually</u> rule people, from one generation of people to the next, now and forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His dominion:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>His dominion</em> means “God’s rule.” It is synonymous with “His kingdom.” See the Notes at 4:3c. It may be natural to translate this with a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will rule</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will reign</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>generation:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>generation</em> refers to an age group. Parents are one generation, their children another, and their grandchildren another. God will rule over each new age group that is born. There are at least two ways to say this:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:3c–d</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Translate literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will reign over each new generation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His sovereignty endures through all generations (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will rule for all time (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be natural to repeat the same idea in two different ways. If that is true in your language, you may be able to combine Daniel 4:3c–d into one clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3c-d</sup>God will rule forever over each new generation</p></blockquote></div>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language.

They were unable to explain the meaning of his dream. Before you translate this paragraph, read Genesis 40 and Genesis 41:1–2, where there are descriptions of similar events that took place in ancient Egypt.</p></div><h4>4:4a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace:</strong> Daniel 4:4a–b gives the background to the account that begins in 4:5. The two parts of the verse are in Aramaic poetic form, with the second line repeating the basic meaning of the first. It literally says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I Nebuchadnezzar was at ease in my house</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I was flourishing/prospering in my palace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions translate this form closely. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living at ease in my home and prospering in my palace. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The NIV has reordered the information and made it clear that “my home” and “my palace” refer to the same location.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other versions that combine these parallel lines include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was happy and successful at my palace. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace in comfort and prosperity.

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, Nebuchadnezzar was living comfortably in my house (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>I, Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> The king said his name in order to emphasize his authority. In some languages it may not be natural for a person to state his name after saying <em>I</em>.

The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004004\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004007\"><h3>Paragraph 4:4–7</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream and summoned the wise men of Babylon. They were unable to explain the meaning of his dream. Before you translate this paragraph, read Genesis 40 and Genesis 41:1–2, where there are descriptions of similar events that took place in ancient Egypt.</p></div><h4>4:5</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse is also in poetic form, with two parts or lines. The second part, 4:5b, repeats the meaning of the first part, 4:5a, but also adds more information. Both parts describe the same event.</p><h4>4:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I had a dream, and it frightened me;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> I dreamed something that frightened me.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> one night I had/dreamed a terrifying dream.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I had a dream, and it frightened me:</strong> The fear that the king describes in this verse contrasts with the peace he described in the previous verse. In some languages it may be helpful to make this contrast clear. For example, you may supply a connector:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But</u> one night I had a dream that frightened me (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I had a dream:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>I had a dream</em> is literally “I saw a dream.” Use an expression that is natural in your language to refer to dreaming in one’s sleep. See how you translated the word <em>dream</em> in 2:1a and 2:3a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and it frightened me:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>frightened me</em> indicates that what Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream caused him to feel very frightened. Use the expression that is natural in your language for describing the effect of a bad dream or nightmare. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which terrified me (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that greatly frightened me (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that scared me (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>4:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>As I was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">asleep</span> in bed, I saw/had dreams and visions that horrified me.</p></li><li><p>What I saw in my/those nightmares filled me with fear/dread.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">4:5b is parallel to 4:5a. It says the same thing in a different way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>while in my bed:</strong> In Daniel’s time, people usually explained where they were when they had an important dream. See also 2:28c. In some languages, some of this information may be implied by the context. If that is true in your language, you may not have to translate this information directly. For example, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>while I was asleep (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as I was sleeping</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the images and visions in my mind:</strong> The Aramaic words that the BSB translates as <em>images</em> and <em>visions</em> are synonyms in this context. They are also synonyms of the word “dream” in 4:5a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>images:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>images</em> means “appearances, fantasies.” It refers generally to something a person might imagine or think about. You may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pictures (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>things I imagined (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fantasies (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>visions in my mind:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>visions in my mind</em> is literally “the visions of my head.” In some languages the expression <em>in my mind</em> is implied by the word <em>visions</em>. If that is true in your language, you may omit this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>visions (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>alarmed me:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>alarmed</em> is a synonym to the verb “frightened” in 4:5a. The king saw visions that frightened him. Some other translation models include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>terrified me (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tormented me (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I saw…terrifying visions (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:4a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages you may not have three different words with similar meanings like “dreams,” “images,” and “visions.” If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate using one or two terms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>One night as I lay on my bed I had a dream that tormented me. What I saw was terrifying.</p></blockquote></div>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004004\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004007\"><h3>Paragraph 4:4–7</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream and summoned the wise men of Babylon.

This clause tells what the king did as a result of seeing the dream and becoming afraid. Introduce this result in a way that is natural in your language. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I issued a decree:</strong> The king issued an order, a royal command or decree.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here the Aramaic is literally “from me a decree was issued.”</span></span> Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I ordered (GW. GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I decreed (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I commanded (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me:</strong> This is the content of the king’s order or decree. The king’s servants were to bring all the wise men of Babylon into his presence. In some languages it may be more natural to use direct speech. See the General Comment on 4:6a–c for a suggestion of how to do this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me:</strong> This is a passive clause. If it is more natural to use an active verb you may be able to:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>use an indefinite subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they (indefinite) should bring to me all the wise men of Babylon</p></blockquote></li><li><p>use an intransitive form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all the wise men of Babylon must come to me</p></blockquote></li><li><p>supply a subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">my servants</span> should bring all the wise men of Babylon to me</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the wise men:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the wise men</em> refers to a class of men with certain responsibilities. They were professional advisers to the king and experts in various occult practices. See the Notes at 2:12b, 2:27. In this context, this expression may be a general term for all of the king’s religious experts and advisers. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the royal advisers (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Babylon:</strong> Here this term probably refers to the whole kingdom, and not only the capital city with that same name. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Babylonia (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to interpret the dream for me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that they might interpret/explain my dream for/to me.</p></li><li><p>so that they could tell me what my dream meant.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to interpret the dream for me:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>to</em> here introduces the purpose of bringing the wise men to the king. The king wanted them to explain to him the meaning of his dream. See Genesis 41:8, where there is a similar situation. This is a purpose clause. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to tell me the dream’s meaning (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so they could tell me what my dream meant (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that one of them might tell me what the dream meant<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em>.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>interpret the dream:</strong> See the Notes at 2:5b. The verb that the BSB translates as <em>interpret</em> means “inform, tell.” The king wanted the wise men to tell or explain to him the meaning of his dream. He thought it must have some connection to real life, but he did not know what it was. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make known…the interpretation of the dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:6a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the king’s command as direct speech.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">all the occult experts</span> , including the astrologers and the fortunetellers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">For similar lists of experts see the Notes at 1:20b and 2:2a, 1:10c, 1:27.</p></div><h4>4:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I told them the dream, and they could not interpret it for me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I told them about my dream, but they were not able to tell me its meaning/interpretation.</p></li><li><p>I told them what I had dreamed, but they could not explain to me what the dream meant.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I told them the dream:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar told the experts what had happened in his dream. The author does not repeat this information. In some languages it may be necessary to identify this dream in some way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I told them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">terrifying</span> dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I told them what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> had <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just</span> dreamed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces a contrast, something that is against expectation.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004008\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004009\"><h3>Paragraph 4:8–9</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel went before the king in order to tell him the meaning of his dream.</p></div><h4>4:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But at last, into my presence came Daniel</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Finally, Daniel came to me.</p></li><li><p>¶ Last of all, Daniel came <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to speak</span> to me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But at last:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>But at last</em> here refers to the end of a period of time. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Finally (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>into my presence came Daniel:</strong> Daniel entered the king’s court, where he could talk to the king. See the Notes at 4:7a. The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>into my presence</em> is literally “before me.” It implies that Daniel had come to speak to someone who had a higher status.</p><h4>4:8b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has placed 4:8b–c in parentheses to indicate that this is parenthetical information. It is not part of the main storyline. Nebuchadnezzar was telling his people some information about Daniel that he wanted them to know. Indicate that this parenthetical information in a way that is natural in your language. The NRSV, for example, uses dashes.</p><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>(I had given Daniel the name Belteshazzar after the name of my god,</p></li><li><p>(Daniel&apos;s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Babylonian</span> name was Belteshazzar. I had named him after <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Bel,</span> the god I worship,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar explained that Daniel’s Babylonian name was <em>Belteshazzar</em>. The king had given him this name in honor of a god he himself worshiped, Bel. See the notes on 1:7b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>whose name is Belteshazzar:</strong> This is a passive clause. There are several ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he who was named Belteshazzar (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom I named Belteshazzar</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a form of the verb “to be”: For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Babylonian/new</span> name is Belteshazzar.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>after the name of my god:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>after the name of my god</em> is more literally “like the name of my god.” The main god whom Nebuchadnezzar worshiped was called Bel, which means “lord.” This was another name for the Babylonian false god Marduk. You may want to put this information in a footnote. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>after my god (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>after my god <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Bel</span> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I called him Belteshazzar to honor my god (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>my god:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar worshiped a false god whom he called Bel, that is, “lord.” It may be natural to make this relationship clear by translating the phrase <em>my god</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Bel</span> , the god/idol that I worship</p></blockquote><h4>4:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods).</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the spirit of the holy gods lives in him.)</p></li><li><p>because the sacred gods/deities have given him their spirit.)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces more parenthetical information about Daniel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in whom is the spirit of the holy gods:</strong> This clause probably refers to Daniel’s special wisdom. The king was praising Daniel. He realized that Daniel’s ability to understand dreams and visions was supernatural. Daniel understood things that only divine beings can know.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Since we do not know exactly what Nebuchadnezzar was thinking, it is best to translate this literally. Remember that the king thought that there were many gods.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the holy gods:</strong> The word <em>holy</em> is a key term in the Old Testament. In this context, it describes the gods as separate, distinct from human beings. They are set apart as sacred and belong to the supernatural realm. You may be able to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the gods, who are far/separate from us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the gods, who live above</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the gods on high</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gods:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>gods</em> is in the plural. King Nebuchadnezzar believed that there were many different gods.</p><h4>4:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And I told him the dream:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And I told him my dream.</p></li><li><p>I told him what I had dreamed about.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And I told him the dream:</strong> The king told Daniel what he had seen in his dream.

Use the word that you used in 2:18a and see the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>baffles you:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates <em>baffles</em> normally means “oppress.” The king used the word in a figurative way to emphasize that Daniel had great abilities.

The expression is more literally: “the visions of my dream which I saw and its interpretation tell.” However, the king did not ask Daniel to tell him the content of his dream as he had in chapter 2. He himself told Daniel what he had dreamed. As a result, some versions supply implied information or suggest changes to the Aramaic text.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9a</sup>I said “Belteshazzar, chief of my expert advisers! <sup>9d</sup>Tell me the meaning of my dream! <sup>9b</sup>For the holy gods have given you a spirit <sup>9c</sup>that understands all such mysteries.</p></blockquote></div>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004010\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004012\"><h3>Paragraph 4:10–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Nebuchadnezzar described the tree he had seen in his dream.</p></div><h4>4:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In these visions of my mind as I was lying in bed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ This is what I dreamed while I was asleep in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> bed:</p></li><li><p>¶ In my dream,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In these visions of my mind as I was lying in bed:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>In these visions of my mind as I was lying in bed</em> is more literally “the visions of my head on my bed.” This phrase introduces Nebuchadnezzar’s account of his dream. The BSB has supplied the words <em>In these</em>, as is natural in English. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Here are the visions of my mind while I was on my bed. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>While I was lying in my bed, this is what I dreamed. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>While I was asleep, I had a vision of… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The expression points ahead to the retelling of the dream that begins in 4:10b. Translate it in a way that is natural for introducing such an account.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as I was lying in bed:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to indicate that the king was asleep. You may wish to leave implied the information that he was <em>in bed</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while I was asleep (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>4:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I saw this come to pass: There was a tree in the midst of the land,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I dreamed that there was a tree, standing/growing in the middle of the earth.</p></li><li><p>I saw a tree. It was in the very center of the world,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I saw this come to pass:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>I saw this come to pass</em> here introduces a retelling of a dream. See the Notes at 2:31, where the same expression is used. If your language has a special way to introduce a dream, you may be able to use it here. The following are some ways English versions translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was looking and I saw (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I looked, and there in front of me (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this come to pass:</strong> See the Notes at 2:31. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>come to pass</em> often introduces something new or unexpected. It directs the reader to give attention to what the speaker is about to say. If you have an equivalent word in your language, you can use it here. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there before me (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There was a tree in the midst of the land:</strong> In his dream Nebuchadnezzar saw a tree. It was upright. That is, it was growing, planted in the ground. And it was in a central or prominent position. In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the middle of the land a tree was growing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the very center of the land there was a tree</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a tree:</strong> A <em>tree</em> was a common symbol in the Old Testament. In this context the <em>tree</em> is a symbol of the king, who protects and provides for his people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Isaiah 11:1; 53:2; Ezekiel 31 (The pharaoh is compared to a tree of Lebanon); Ezekiel 17:1–10 (David’s dynasty is compared to a cedar of Lebanon).</span></span> The text does not say what kind of tree the king saw. In some languages it may be necessary to be specific. If this is so in your language, you should indicate that it was a type of fruit-bearing deciduous tree.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the midst of the land:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>in the midst of the land</em> indicates that the tree was in a central or prominent location. It was growing in a place where everyone could see it.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the land:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>land</em> can mean ground, country, earth, or world, depending on the context. Here the context suggests that it refers to everywhere that was under Nebuchadnezzar’s power. This included most of the world known at that time. Use the expression that is natural in your language here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the earth (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the world (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and its height was great.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was very tall.</p></li><li><p>and it was huge.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>its height was great:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>height</em> refers to the distance from the bottom of an object to the top. The height of the tree was very great. That is, the tree was very tall. See the Notes on 2:31 referring to the tall statue of the king. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Its height was enormous (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was very tall (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a huge tree (GNT)</p></blockquote>",

(NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>its top reached the sky:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>reached</em> here indicates that the tree appeared to reach or touch the sky. This can be understood as a figurative way of saying that the tree was very tall. However, since this was a dream, it is possible that this is how it did appear to Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar probably believed the sky to be a flat surface, so he probably dreamed in those terms. A literal translation is therefore acceptable. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>its top touched the sky (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it became…tall enough to reach the sky (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its top:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>its top</em> is the same as in 4:10c, where it is translated as “its height.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sky:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the sky</em> has two possible meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The literal sky. In ancient thinking, the sky was a flat surface stretched out some distance above the earth.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The stars were thought of as holes in this surface, holes that allowed in light from beyond the sky itself.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>its height reached the sky (NASB) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NASB, NJB, REB, NET, GW, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The place where God lives, heaven. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>its top reached to heaven (NRSV) <em>(KJV, RSV/NRSV, ESV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some of the versions listed supporting interpretation (2) may be using “heaven” in a figurative way, as is common in poetry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Nebuchadnezzar himself probably thought that the gods lived in the sky. So the two interpretations are not too different in this context. However, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). That probably best represents what Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream. However, if it is more natural in your language to say “heaven” in this context, in a dream narrative, that is also acceptable.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:11a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to make a close connection between the clauses in 4:11a.

In Nebuchadnezzar’s dream this was possible because the earth or world was probably flat. So something tall standing in the center could be seen everywhere.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it was visible:</strong> The phrase <em>it was visible</em> means “it could be seen.” If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everyone in the world could see it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people could see it from anywhere on earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the ends of the earth:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates <em>the ends of the earth</em> is an idiom. It refers to the farthest place on earth. The word that the BSB translates as <em>the earth</em> here is the same word as that translated as “the land” in 4:10b. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the idiom.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004010\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004012\"><h3>Paragraph 4:10–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Nebuchadnezzar described the tree he had seen in his dream.</p></div><h4>4:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Its leaves were beautiful and it had/produced lots of fruit.</p></li><li><p>It had green, healthy leaves and much fruit,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Its leaves were beautiful:</strong> The leaves of this great tree were healthy, green, and flourishing. Describe the leaves on a healthy tree in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It had fresh green leaves (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>its fruit was abundant:</strong> There was a lot of fruit on this tree. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it had plenty of good fruit on it (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was loaded down with fruit (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>heavy with fruit (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and upon it was food for all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>There was enough food to feed everyone.</p></li><li><p>enough/plenty for everyone.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces a result. The tree bore a lot of fruit, so there was enough food for everyone. In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and so</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>upon it was food for all:</strong> This clause emphasizes the great amount of fruit. The tree provided plenty of food, enough to feed everyone. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>enough food for everyone (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>enough for the whole world to eat (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for all:</strong> The expression that the BSB translates <em>for all</em> is a general term that can refer to all living beings. In this context, it seems to refer more specifically to people. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everyone (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:12a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to link the last clause of 4:12a and 4:12b closely together. There was so much fruit that there was plenty for everyone. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was loaded with fruit for all to eat (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>its fruit was so plentiful that it could feed everyone on earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it bore so much fruit that everyone on earth could eat from it</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Under it the beasts of the field found shelter,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Wild animals lived in its shade. (NLT)</p></li><li><p>The tree provided shade/shelter for wild animals.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Under it the beasts of the field found shelter:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>found shelter</em> here indicates that the wild animals were sheltered and protected from the sun by the branches of the tree. The tree provided them with a shady place to rest. In some languages it may be natural to make the tree the subject of this clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the wild animals it provided shade (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beasts of the field:</strong> This Aramaic expression, which the BSB translates literally, refers in general to animals that do not live in barns, cages, or other man-made structures. Refer to such animals in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wild beasts (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the wild animals (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in its branches the birds of the air nested,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Birds lived/nested in its branches.</p></li><li><p>Birds built their nests on its branches.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in its branches the birds of the air nested:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>in its branches the birds of the air nested</em> means that various birds made their nests in the great tree. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>birds built nests in its branches (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The birds of heaven nested in its branches (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and birds nested in its branches (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the birds of the air:</strong> This Aramaic expression, which the BSB translates literally as <em>the birds of the air</em>, refers to wild birds, birds that fly around freely, as opposed to birds kept for food, like chickens.</p><h4>4:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and from it every creature was fed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Every living being found/received their food on/from the tree.</p></li><li><p>The tree provided food for all the people and animals.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and from it every creature was fed:</strong> This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every living being ate food from the tree.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All animals and people got/obtained food from the tree.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the tree provided food for all the people and animals on the earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>every creature:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>every creature</em> is more literally “all flesh.” It probably refers to all living beings in general, including people, animals, and birds. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all living beings (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all living creatures (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All the world (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to mention the different types of creature separately. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all people, all birds, and all animals</p></blockquote>",

Some languages may have a special way to introduce a new part of a dream or vision. If that is true in your language, you may use that way here. The BSB uses the word <em>also</em> to indicate that this is a new part of the king’s dream. The following are some other ways English versions do this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then as I lay there dreaming (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As I was looking at those things…I saw (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I watched the visions passing through my head as I lay in bed: …Next… (NJB[4:10])</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>As I lay on my bed:</strong> See the Notes at 2:28c and 4:5b. The phrase also occurs at 4:10a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I also saw in the visions of my mind:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the visions of my mind</em> is literally “the visions of my head.” See the Notes at 4:5b. The phrase also occurs at 4:10a. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language for referring to dreams that come during sleep.</p><h4>4:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a watcher, a holy one,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and suddenly there appeared a watcher, an angel,</p></li><li><p>I saw an angel of God, alert and watchful.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:13a-b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I also saw in the visions of my mind a watcher, a holy one:</strong> While the king was dreaming about the tree, a figure appeared in his dream. This figure was apparently human-like in form. It is described as <em>a watcher</em> and a holy one.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a watcher, a holy one:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a watcher, a holy one</em>, is literally “a watcher and a holy one.” The two Aramaic terms refer to the same being. They are two different descriptions of the one human-like figure that the king saw. In your translation, it is important that your readers do not think that there were two different beings. It may be necessary to combine the terms into one expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A holy angel (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>A holy watcher (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an angel, alert and watchful (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>a watcher:</strong> This expression is one of a number of expressions in Daniel referring to heavenly beings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, “angel” (3:28); “one of those who were standing there [before God]” (7:16); “Michael, one of the chief princes” (10:13).</span></span> The term may refer to a special class of angels. Just as human kings had watchmen, so God had supernatural watchmen who provided for and controlled his heavenly kingdom. English versions have translated this expression in different ways. For example, you may:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Translate literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>watcher (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an observer (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Describe what the watcher does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>alert and watchful (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>messenger (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate who the watcher was. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A holy angel (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>a holy one:</strong> In this context the Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>holy</em> explains who the watcher was, rather than his moral character. He was a <em>holy one</em>, a being who came from God and belonged to God. See also the discussion in the Notes at 4:8c. The same word is used in the plural to refer to angels in Psalm 89:7. See how you translated it there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>angel (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>of/from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>one of God’s holy ones</p></blockquote><h4>4:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>coming down from heaven.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who came down from heaven.</p></li><li><p>He came from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God in</span> heaven.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>coming down from heaven:</strong> This expression describes “the holy one, the messenger.” This holy one came from heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>heaven</em> can refer to the sky and to God’s home. The king believed that God lived in the sky, so in this context both are true. In the dream the king probably saw the angel coming from the sky. But the important point is that the angel came from God. So it is good to follow the majority of English translations and use a word that refers to God’s dwelling place.</p>",

For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004013\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004016\"><h3>Paragraph 4:13–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph the king continued to tell Daniel his dream.</p></div><h4>4:14–16</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verses the messenger/watcher made a number of commands. He was speaking with authority as a holy one from God. The text implies that the things that he commanded were certain to happen. However, the text does not identify to whom he was talking. The notes will suggest ways to translate these commands.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Compare the commands in Genesis 1:9, 11, 20, 22, 24. Here God gave commands to non-human creatures and non-living objects. His commands were authoritative: the commands themselves caused the actions to take place.</p><h4>4:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He called out in a loud voice: ‘Cut down the tree and chop off its branches;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He shouted, ‘Cut<sup>(plur)</sup> down the tree and cut off its branches.</p></li><li><p>In a loud voice he declared, ‘They must cut down the tree and remove its branches.</p></li><li><p>He spoke with strength and said, ‘The tree must be chopped down and its branches cut off.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He called out in a loud voice:</strong> The Aramaic literally has two verbs, as in the RSV (“He cried aloud and said thus”). The two verbs of speech emphasize that this was an important announcement. The holy one spoke with authority. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this idea using only one verb, as the BSB has done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He shouted (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He proclaimed in a loud voice (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Cut down the tree:</strong> The holy one did not say who was to cut down the tree. There are at least two ways to translate this command:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it as a direct command. The holy one gave an order to cut down the tree. The command is in the plural.

This word only occurs here in Daniel 4:14.</span></span> Again there are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it as a direct command. The holy one commanded others to shake off or remove the leaves from the tree. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>shake off its leaves (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as an authoritative declaration. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They (indefinite) must strip off its leaves.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Its leaves are to be torn off.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Its leaves will be stripped away.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. Again, the people being addressed are not in focus.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and scatter its fruit:</strong> The action is destructive. There are two ways to translate this idea:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it as a command. The watcher commanded others to take the fruit off the tree and to throw it in different directions. Again, the text does not say who the watcher was talking to. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Scatter the fruit (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>pull off the fruit and throw it all over</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as an authoritative statement.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They (indefinite) must scatter the fruit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The fruit is to be scattered (passive)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Its fruit will be scattered.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>scatter:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>scatter</em> means “disperse, throw in different directions.” It is implied that the fruit will be wasted. No one will collect it for food. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>throw away (NJB)</p></blockquote><h4>4:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Make the animals flee from its shelter and make the birds flee from its branches.</p></li><li><p>The animals must run away from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their homes</span> under the tree.

They (indefinite) must cause the birds to fly away from its branches.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let the beasts flee from under it:</strong> The watcher continued to shout commands. This command is addressed to the wild animals that were sheltering under the tree. They were told to run away from their homes or shelters under the tree.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are different ways to translate this command:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate this as a command. The holy one ordered that the wild animals not stay under the shelter of the branches of the tree. Address these animals in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Flee from under the tree, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> you wild animals!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Leave your homes/shelter, creatures <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the forest</span>!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to address this command to people, rather than the animals themselves.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something.

The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004013\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004016\"><h3>Paragraph 4:13–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph the king continued to tell Daniel his dream.</p></div><h4>4:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, and a band of iron and bronze around it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But leave<sup>(plur)</sup> the stump and roots of the tree in the ground.

The BSB has not translated this connector. Introduce this next command in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>Let him be drenched</em> is a command. It functions as a declaration of what must and will happen. There are at least two ways to translate this expression:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it as an authoritative statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will become wet from the dew of heaven</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a third-person command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now let the dew fall on this man (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as a command addressed to the dew. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Dew from the sky, fall on this man!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be unnatural to command the dew to do something. If that is true in your language, you should follow the first option.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>him:</strong> The Aramaic pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>him</em> is ambiguous. In Aramaic the word for tree is masculine, so the pronoun could refer either to the stump or to a man. The vision slowly changes from a dream about a tree stump to a dream about a man. The angel began to speak about the man, the ruler, whom the stump represented. Some translations transition to using the pronoun “him” here and some continue to use “it,” that is, the stump. The possibilities are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>use “him.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let him be wet with the dew of heaven. (ESV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, ESV, RSV, NRSV, REB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>use “it.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let it become damp with the dew of the sky (NET) <em>(NJB, KJV, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>make a sharp change with an explicit reference to a man. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let the man become wet from dew (NCV) <em>(NCV, GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have a third person pronoun that can refer to either the stump or to a man, you can use that here. Try to make the transition as gradual as possible. If you must choose, it is probably best to use a noun or pronoun that refers specifically to a man. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now let the dew fall on this man (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let him be wet with the dew of heaven (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be drenched:</strong> This is a passive verb. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let him be bathed with the dew of heaven (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unprotected from the dew (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let the man become wet with dew (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let the dew fall on this man (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with the dew of heaven:</strong> <em>dew</em> refers to the moisture that appears during the night in little drops on plants and on the ground. If you do not have a word that means <em>dew</em>, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the water <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that comes at night</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>of heaven:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>heaven</em> here means “sky, air.” In some languages the idea will be implied and can be left untranslated. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the dew (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and graze with the beasts on the grass of the earth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and make<sup>(plur)</sup> him live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">outside</span> with the wild animals and plants.</p></li><li><p>He will/must live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">outdoors</span> with the wild animals/creatures and plants.</p></li><li><p>as his home will be with the beasts, among the plants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and graze with the beasts on the grass of the earth:</strong> The Aramaic text is more literally “and his portion/lot with the animals in the grass of the earth.” The holy one gave the command that the man live with the wild animals in the grasslands. This command functions as a declaration of what must and would take place. There are again several ways to translate this command. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate this as a command</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let him live with the animals and the plants (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate this as an authoritative statement</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He must/will live with the animals and plants</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Continue to use the form that is most natural in your language to express this idea.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with the beasts:</strong> See the Notes at 4:12c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NIV:) live with the animals:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Aramaic word that the NIV translates as <em>live</em> It literally refers to having part or share of something. The possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the kind of life that God determines that a person will live.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It can mean “destiny.” See <em>ḥalaq</em> TDOT 4:448–49.</span></span> The man will live with the animals, like an animal himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let him live with the wild animals among the plants of the field (NLT) <em>(NIV, NLT, KJV, RSV, GNT, CEV, NCV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to sharing the food of the wild animals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>eating grass (NJB) <em>(BSB, NJB, GW, possibly NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions. This interpretation can include the idea of eating the food that wild animals eat.</p>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004013\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004016\"><h3>Paragraph 4:13–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph the king continued to tell Daniel his dream.</p></div><h4>4:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Let his mind be changed from that of a man,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Change<sup>(plur)</sup> his mind from a human mind</p></li><li><p>He will no longer think like a human</p></li><li><p>His thinking/mind must no longer be that of a human being.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let his mind be changed from that of a man:</strong> This verse part has the form of a command. However, this is not a command to someone to do something. It functions as an authoritative declaration. The man’s mind was going to change. This must happen. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it as a command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let him have the mind of an animal (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Give him the mind of an animal (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let him not think like a human any longer (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as an authoritative statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His mind will cease to be human (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is to receive the mind of an animal</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in the way that is most natural in your language. Note that the expression does not mean that the man received an animal’s brain. It means that he lost the ability to think clearly and rationally, like a human being, and he acted as if he was an animal.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Let his mind be changed:</strong> This is a passive clause. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Using a passive verb.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His thinking must be changed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let his mind be altered (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let his mind change</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will no longer think like a man</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will not have a human mind (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>his mind:</strong> This phrase makes it clear that the speaker was now referring to a human being, not a tree stump. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mind</em> is literally “heart.” In the Aramaic language, the heart was the place in the body where people thought, made decisions, and felt emotions. It referred to the source of thoughts and desires. Use the expression that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>a human <u>heart</u> (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><u>think</u> like a human (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>man:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> can refer to any human being, male or female. The king was a man, not a woman, but that is not the point here. The contrast here is between man and animal. So in most languages it is good to follow the NRSV and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human (NRSV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and let him be given the mind of a beast</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to an animal mind.</p></li><li><p>but/and he will think like an animal.</p></li><li><p>Instead, his mind/thinking must become that of a wild beast/creature.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates <em>and</em> in this context introduces the second part of the angel’s command. It involves a contrast between a human and an animal mind. In some languages it may therefore be natural to follow the GNT and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>let him be given the mind of a beast:</strong> This is a command. Like the earlier commands, it functions as an authoritative declaration of what must happen. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it as a command. The angel commanded that the man begin to think and act like an animal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and give it the mind of an animal (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as an authoritative statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he will think like an animal</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he is to begin thinking like a beast</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be given the mind of a beast:</strong> The verb <em>be given</em> is passive. In some languages it may be more natural to use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let him have the mind of an animal (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he must/will receive the mind/thinking of a wild creature</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he is to start thinking like an animal thinks</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the mind of a beast:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>the mind of a beast</em> is literally “animal’s heart.” See the Notes on “mind” at 4:16a. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the heart of a beast (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:16a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to combine Daniel 4:16a–b into one clause with one verb.

He did not say how long these time periods were. There are several different interpretations. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a definite but unspecified period of time, as in 2:8. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>seven time periods (GW) <em>(BSB, RSV/NRSV, NIV, NJB, KJV, REB, GW, NLT, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to a year.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em>. See the ancient Greek translation LXX. HALOT has “years” and cites Daniel 4:13, 20, 22, 29, and 7:25 “three and a half years.” Josephus, Jerome and medieval Jewish commentators follow this view. The duration of Nabonidus’s sickness in 4QPrNab is seven years.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for seven years (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In some languages it may not be possible to refer to an indefinite period of time. If that is the case in your language, you can follow interpretation (2). However, if you follow the second interpretation, you should put interpretation (1) in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pass him by:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>pass him</em> means “come in turns, succeed each other.” In this context, the seven periods of time would happen one after another while the man lived in the field with the animals. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pass over him (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>go by for him (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:16a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in 4:16a–c, translating the time periods involved first.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004017\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004017\"><h3>Paragraph 4:17</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, the watchers spoke about themselves in the third person. This way of speaking indicated their authority. If this is unnatural in your language, you may translate using first-person pronouns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span> , the watchers, have declared this sentence for God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span> , <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> holy ones, announce what he has decided.</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:17a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Biblical authors often wrote poetry in pairs of clauses. The two lines often communicate the same thing in two different ways. Daniel 4:17a–b forms a pair of clauses in poetic speech. You may wish to indent the lines to show that this is poetic speech.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts are more literally</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The command <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> by the decree of the watchers,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the verdict <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> by the word of the holy ones</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The Aramaic text does not explicitly include the verb “is.” In some languages that may be natural and acceptable. In other languages it may be natural to supply verbs or translate the nouns “decree” and “word” as verbs. Most English versions supply one or more verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This sentence <u>is</u> by the decree of the angelic watchers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the decision <u>is</u> a command of the holy ones. (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The sentence <u>is</u> by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones. (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For <u>this has been decreed</u> by the messengers;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>it is commanded</u> by the holy ones. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The observers <u>gave</u> this command;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the holy ones <u>declared</u> the sentence. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">See also the suggestions in the notes that follow.</p><h4>4:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This decision is the decree of the watchers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “The watchers proclaim this verdict.</p></li><li><p>¶ “We the watchful angels announce what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has decided,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This decision is the decree of the watchers:</strong> This verse part refers back to the decision that the messengers had just announced to the king in his dream. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>is the decree of</em> is a noun meaning “by the decree of.” A <em>decree</em> is an official order or decision. There are several ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Such is the sentence proclaimed by the watchers (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The observers gave this command (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The guardians have announced the decision (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We<sup>(excl)</sup> who are watchers proclaim this punishment</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The sentence is by the decree of the watchers. (ESV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this using the form that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>This decision:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>decision</em> implies a formal verdict or judgment. The messengers were announcing the verdict against someone. The content of the verdict was given in 4:14–16 in the form of angelic commands. Other ways English versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This sentence (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this punishment (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to say who made the decision or verdict. In those languages you may indicate that it was God. He told the messengers what to say. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> decision</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the watchers:</strong> See the Notes on “watcher” at 4:13b. Note that the word is plural here. The messengers or watchers spoke about themselves in the third person, emphasizing a formal statement. In some languages it may be necessary to make it clear that the watchers were speaking of themselves by using a first-person pronoun. See the note above on Paragraph 4:17. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> <sup>(excl)</sup> the watchers</p></blockquote><h4>4:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the verdict declared by the holy ones,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These angels declare this punishment</p></li><li><p>and how <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will punish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 4:17b begins with the common connector that is often translated as “and.” Here it introduces a clause that says the same thing as 4:17a but in a different way. This was common in Hebrew and Aramaic poetry. The BSB has not translated this connector. Introduce this next command in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the verdict declared by the holy ones:</strong> God’s holy angels <em>declared</em> the <em>verdict</em> by giving the commands recorded in 4:14–16. It may be natural to make this clearer by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The holy ones declare <u>this</u> verdict</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The holy ones have announced <u>this</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">this is</span> the sentence pronounced by the holy angels</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the holy ones:</strong> See the Notes at 4:13b. This expression is a synonym of “watchers” in 4:17a. In this context, it refers to the same angelic beings as coming from God and belonging to God. So it may again be natural to use a first-person plural pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we,</span> the holy ones</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> holy ones</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the verdict:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>verdict</em> is a synonym of the word “decision” in 4:17a. It refers to the decision of a judge that someone is guilty and will receive punishment. Use the expression that is natural for such a decision. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the sentence (REB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:17a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The two clauses in 4:17a and 4:17b have the same meaning and refer to the same thing. In some languages it may be more natural to combine them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s watchful angels announce this verdict</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This punishment is given at the command of the holy angels. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that the living will know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that every living person may know that the Most High God is lord/king over all earthly kingdoms.</p></li><li><p>God&apos;s purpose is to show everyone that he, the Supreme One, rules over all the nations of the world.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The purpose of the angels’ decree was that everyone would know that God is sovereign over all men.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> here introduces the purpose of the decree, that is, of the punishment. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the purpose of this decree is that (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be possible to speak of an object like a decree as having a purpose. It may be more natural to follow the CEV and indicate result:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It will show to all who live that… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Since the decree was given by God through his holy angels, its purpose was the angels’ purpose and ultimately God’s purpose. So it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the angels</span> ordered this so that…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> ordered this decree so that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the living will know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind:</strong> The holy angels wanted all people to recognize that God has power over all the nations and peoples of the world. He rules over all earthly kings and rulers. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let all people everywhere know that the Supreme God has power over human kingdoms (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everyone may know that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will show to all who live that God Most High controls all kingdoms. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the living:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the living</em> means “all living beings.” In this context it refers primarily to human beings, who are able to know and understand who God is. There is no contrast implied with dead human beings. See how you translated this word in the singular in 2:30b. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all people everywhere (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will know:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>know</em> here means realize or understand. People will know something they did not know before. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>may understand (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>may learn (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>may recognize</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind:</strong> This is what God wanted people to understand: that he is in control over all the earth and is more powerful than any human authority.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Most High:</strong> See the Notes at 4:2b. Here, however, the expression does not occur with the word “God.” In some languages it may be necessary to make the word “God” explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the Supreme God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God Most High (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Most High God (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>rules over:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>rules</em> is literally “powerful, mighty” or “lord over.” English versions translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>rules (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>has power over (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>controls (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the kingdom of mankind:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>the kingdom of mankind</em> is more literally “the kingdom of man,” in the singular. It probably refers to human rule in general. That is, it refers to all the many kingdoms that exist or have existed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>human sovereignty (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>human kingdoms (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>every kingdom on earth (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the kingdom:</strong> See the Notes at 4:3c. The rulers of nations may be called kings, emperors, or have other titles such as president or chancellor. It is good to use a word that refers to any human unit of government ruled by a single powerful man.</p><h4>4:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and gives it to whom He wishes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He can give authority to rule the kingdoms to whomever he wants,</p></li><li><p>He can choose/place anyone he wants to be their king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and gives it to whom He wishes:</strong> The phrase <em>gives it to whom He wishes</em> here indicates that God is able to give authority over nations to whomever he wants. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he can give them to anyone he chooses (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God gives those kingdoms to anyone he wants (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and chooses for their rulers whoever he wants</p></blockquote><h4>4:17e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>setting over it the lowliest of men.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>choosing/appointing even the least important man to be their king.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If he wishes,</span> he can make the most insignificant person their ruler.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>setting over it the lowliest of men:</strong> This expression indicates that there are no limits for God. He can choose unlikely people, people of humble backgrounds, to rule nations. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even to those who are least important (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He places the lowest of people in charge of them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He can even choose the most humble man</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>setting over:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>setting</em> literally means “raises” (NJB). In this context, the phrase <em>setting over</em> means to make someone ruler of a nation. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>appoint over (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>place…in charge (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the lowliest of men:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>lowliest</em> means “humble.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 2001</span></span> In this context, it probably refers to people of low social status. Other ways to translate this include</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who are least important (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who are most inferior<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>GeCL97</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the most insignificant of men<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>La Bible du Semeur</span></span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:17d–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">4:17d–e indicates that God is <u>able</u> to choose people of low rank to rule nations. He has full power to appoint whoever he wishes, including a poor or low-status person. In some languages it may be natural to indicate the unexpected nature of such a choice by following the GNT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he can give them to anyone he chooses—<u>even</u> to those who are least important (GNT)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:17a–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Aramaic, as in the BSB, 4:17a–e forms one long sentence. In some languages it may be natural to break this up into several shorter sentences. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><sup>17a</sup>The guardians have announced this decision. <sup>17b</sup>The holy ones have announced this <sup>17c</sup>so that every creature will know that the Most High has power over human kingdoms. <sup>17d</sup>He gives them to whomever he wishes. <sup>17e</sup>He can place the lowest of people in charge of them.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004018\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004018\"><h3>Paragraph 4:18</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Nebuchadnezzar asked Daniel to interpret his dream.</p></div><h4>4:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ That was the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, dreamed.</p></li><li><p>¶ I, Nebuchadnezzar the king, have told you my dream.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw:</strong> The king summarized what he had just been telling Daniel.

(RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, dreamed (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have told you my dream.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>This is the dream:</strong> In this context the Aramaic pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>This</em> refers <u>back</u>, to the contents of the dream in 4:13–17. In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>that</u> was the dream (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I, King Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> The king mentioned his name to emphasize his authority and the importance of what he was about to ask. If it is unnatural in your language for a ruler to state his name like this, you may have another way to express this same emphasis.</p><h4>4:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And you, Belteshazzar, must interpret it for me,</p></li><li><p>I want you, Belteshazzar, to explain its meaning,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>Now</em> here introduces the king’s command to Daniel. The king required Daniel to explain the dream he had just described to him. Introduce this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So now</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Belteshazzar:</strong> The king addressed Daniel by his Babylonian name.

The king commanded Daniel to interpret his dream because none of the other wise men were able to do it. Introduce this reason in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>none of the wise men of my kingdom can interpret it for me:</strong> The king had already called his various experts to him to explain the dream.

(GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>none of the wise men of my kingdom can do so (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea using a negative verb.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004019\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004023\"><h3>Paragraph 4:19–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Daniel began to interpret the king’s dream.</p></div><h4>4:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For a time, Daniel, who was also known as Belteshazzar, was perplexed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ For a short while/time Daniel, that is, Belteshazzar, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">stood there</span> horrified/appalled.</p></li><li><p>¶ For a few minutes, Daniel, whom I had named Belteshazzar, was too shocked by the dream <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to answer</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For a time, Daniel, who was also known as Belteshazzar, was perplexed:</strong> Daniel did not immediately obey the king’s command. He was deeply disturbed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>For a time:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>a time</em> refers to a brief time.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 2000–2001.</span></span> Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for a while (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>For:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> here introduces Daniel’s response and a new phase in the account. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Then (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Daniel, who was also known as Belteshazzar:</strong> This is background information. The author had previously mentioned Daniel’s Babylonian name in 4:8b and 4:18b. Translate this repeated background information in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was perplexed:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>perplexed</em> has been interpreted in two main ways in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “disturbed, appalled.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another possibility is “was momentarily stunned” (GW).</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was severely distressed (NRSV) <em>(RSV/NRSV, GNT, NASB, ESV, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “confused, puzzled.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was terribly confused (CEV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, NJPS, CEV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) is recommended. Daniel was very unhappy at what he heard. He was dismayed, shocked, or horrified. This interpretation fits the context of 4:20 better and is followed by the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to indicate what disturbed or distressed Daniel. You make wish to supply “the dream” as the subject of the clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The dream</span> troubled Daniel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The king’s dream</span> shocked Daniel.</p></blockquote><h4>4:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and his thoughts alarmed him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He thought about the dream and felt terrified.</p></li><li><p>As he thought about it, he was very frightened.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and his thoughts alarmed him:</strong> This expression has a similar meaning to 4:19a. Daniel was deeply disturbed when he thought about the dream. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his thoughts terrified him (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>what he was thinking frightened him (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>worried by what he was thinking (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his thoughts:</strong> This Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>his thoughts</em> refers to what Daniel thought about the meaning of the dream. The NLT says explicitly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>frightened by the meaning of the dream (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>alarmed:</strong> See the Notes at 4:5b. The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>alarmed</em> is an approximate synonym to the verb in 4:19a. Daniel was horrified and alarmed by the meaning of the dream.</p><h4>4:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream and its message alarm you.”</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> the king told him, “Do not be shocked by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my</span> dream, Belteshazzar. Do not be afraid of what it means. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Tell me.</span>”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> The BSB has supplied the connector <em>So</em>. The Aramaic does not indicate the connection between 4:19b and 4:19c. Most English versions have no explicit connection. You should introduce the king’s response to Daniel in a way that is natural in your language. For example</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the king said:</strong> Here the king’s proclamation begins to refer to the king in the third person. Some English versions continue to use the first person, as in 4:2, 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I told him (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to make the reference clear by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> the king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>said:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>said</em> is literally “answers and tells.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some English translations change from third person to first person. For example, the GW has: “I told him.” The CEV has: “But I said.”</span></span> The two verbs of speech emphasize that the king was about to say something important. If this is unnatural in your language, you may use one verb like the BSB does. However, try to keep the same emphasis.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Belteshazzar:</strong> The king addressed Daniel by his Babylonian name. See the Notes at 4:8b, 4:18b, 4:19a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do not let the dream or its interpretation alarm you:</strong> The king ordered Daniel not to be frightened because of the dream or because of the meaning of the dream. Translate this negative command in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not let the dream or its meaning make you afraid (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>don’t be alarmed by the dream and what it means (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>alarm:</strong> This is the same verb as in 4:19b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:19c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The king wanted Daniel to tell him what his dream meant. He did not state this explicitly in this verse part, but it is implied. The king was trying to reassure Daniel. He was implying that he would not be angry at Daniel if the meaning was not a good one. In some languages it may be natural to make some of this implicit meaning explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not be alarmed by the dream, Belteshazzar, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whatever</span> it means. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Tell it to me.</span></p></blockquote></div><h4>4:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“My lord,” replied Belteshazzar, “may the dream apply to those who hate you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Belteshazzar answered, “My king, I wish that the dream referred/applied to those who hate you.</p></li><li><p>¶ Belteshazzar replied, “Master, it would be good/preferable if the dream was about your enemies,</p></li><li><p>¶ Belteshazzar replied to the king, “Sir, I am sorry that the dream is for you, not for your enemies!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“My lord,”:</strong> Daniel addressed the king by the title <span data-bnType=\"implied\">My lord</span>. This is a title of respect. Daniel addressed the king as someone important who had authority over him. If you have a title like this in your language, you can use it here. Other ways English versions translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My master (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>replied Belteshazzar:</strong> Daniel responded to the king. Here he is called by his Babylonian name.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>may the dream apply to those who hate you:</strong> Daniel was implying that he knew that the dream applied to the king, and that the meaning was not a good one. The dream symbolized something bad that was going to happen to the king. Daniel wished that this bad thing would happen to the king’s enemies, rather than to the king himself. However, the context implies that Daniel was certain that it would happen to the king.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider how it is natural in your language to talk about something that the speaker desires but knows is not true. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I wish the dream were about your enemies. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How good it would be if the dream applied to your enemies.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It would be a good thing if this dream was about your enemies! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But it is not.</span></p></blockquote><h4>4:19e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:19e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and its interpretation to your enemies!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I wish that its meaning/interpretation <span data-bnType=\"implied\">referred/applied</span> to your enemies.</p></li><li><p>if its meaning/message was for your opponents, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not for you</span>.</p></li><li><p>I regret that it means that something <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bad</span> will happen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span> rather than to your foes!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and its interpretation to your enemies!:</strong> The common Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces another way of saying the same thing as the previous clause.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>its interpretation to your enemies!:</strong> This is a short way of saying “if only the meaning of the dream applied to your adversaries!” Daniel wished the meaning/message of the dream concerned or referred to Nebuchadnezzar’s enemies. Other ways English versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I wish its meaning were for those who are against you! (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I wish that the dream meant that your enemies would experience these things!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>to your enemies:</strong> The context implies “rather than to you” or “and not to you.” Daniel wished the dream referred or applied to the king’s enemies <u>instead of</u> to the king. He knew it applied to the king but did not wish to state this clearly. In your translation, it is good to leave this implied. However it is important to check that your readers will understand the implication. In some languages it may be natural or necessary to make this implied information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I wish the dream was about those who hate you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and not about you</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>I wish the events foreshadowed in this dream would happen to your enemies, my lord, and not to you! (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:19e–f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">4:19e and 4:19f basically mean the same thing. If it is unnatural in your language to repeat information like this, you may be able to combine the two clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I wish the dream had been against your enemies. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

The order of these clauses creates suspense. This ordering also places the emphasis on the last clause, 4:22a, “you, O king, are that tree!” In some languages, however, it may be more natural to present this information in a different order. The Notes will suggest some ways you may do this. For example, it may be natural to begin with the point of comparison:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The tree that you saw in your dream was you, O king. That tree grew and became strong.</p></blockquote><h4>4:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The tree you saw</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As you were dreaming,</span> you saw a tree.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In your dream,</span> you saw a tree.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The tree you saw:</strong> See the Notes at 4:10b. The king had seen a tree in his dream, and this tree is the main topic of the dream. Introduce this topic in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You saw a tree in your dream (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You described</span> a tree that you saw in a dream.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now concerning the tree you dreamed about</p></blockquote><h4>4:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that grew large and strong, whose top reached the sky</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It grew tall and strong.

Translate in the same or a similar way here. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a complete sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It grew large and strong, and its top reached to the sky.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In your dream</span> this tree grew to become strong and tall, so tall that it seemed to touch the sky.</p></blockquote><h4>4:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and was visible to all the earth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>People could see the tree from anywhere on earth.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It grew so high that</span> everyone in the world could see the tree.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was visible to all the earth:</strong> See the Notes at 4:11b.

The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004019\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004023\"><h3>Paragraph 4:19–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Daniel began to interpret the king’s dream.</p></div><h4>4:22a–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 4:22a–d is in poetic form. The parts c-d are in parallelism to parts a-b. 4:22c–d repeats the meaning in 4:22a–b but is more specific.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup>It is you, O king, who have grown <sup>b</sup>and become strong.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>c</sup>Your greatness, has grown and reaches until heaven <sup>d</sup>and your dominion to the ends of the earth.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Aramaic poetry uses figurative language. The Notes will explain the meaning of the figures of speech in 4:22 and will give some suggestions about how best to translate this verse.</p><h4>4:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you, O king, are that tree!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And, sir, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as for</span> that tree—it is you!</p></li><li><p>That tree <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the dream</span>—it represents you, Your Majesty!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you, O king, are that tree!:</strong> This verse part is the climax toward which 4:19–21 has been building. The BSB uses an exclamation mark to give it emphasis. Emphasize this statement and mark it as a climax in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you, O king:</strong> See the Notes at 2:4b, 2:29a. Daniel addressed the king with respect. Languages often have special ways to address a king or other important people in authority. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O king (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>you, O king, are that tree</em> emphasizes the pronoun <em>you</em>. The tree in the dream represented the king. Indicate this comparison in a way that is natural in your language. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is you (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That tree is you (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For you have become great and strong;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As the tree grew great,</span> so you have grown great. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As the tree became strong,</span> so you have become strong.</p></li><li><p>Your fame/glory has increased. You have grown in power/might.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For you have become great and strong:</strong> This is more literally “you have become/grown great and you have grown/become strong.” Daniel compared the king to the tree. This verse part indicates the point of comparison: Just like the tree became great/tall and strong, so did the king. However, Daniel used the verbs “grow/become great” and “grow/become strong” in two different ways. The king did not grow big and tall in size like the tree. Instead, it was the king’s fame and reputation that became great. People all over the known world respected and honored him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is natural to use the same verb for the king and the tree, you may do that here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is more natural to use two different verbs to describe what happened to the king and the tree, that is also acceptable. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As the tree</span> <u>grew</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great and strong,</span> so you have <u>become</u> great and strong.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>have become great:</strong> In some languages you may have to indicate in what way the king had become great. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Your reputation has increased.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>You have become very important</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>and strong:</strong> Just as the tree became strong, so the king had become strong. Daniel again used the same verb in two different ways. Daniel did not mean that the king increased in physical strength. He meant that the king’s authority and power to rule increased.</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If it is natural to use the same verb for the king and the tree, you may do that here.</p></li><li><p>If it is more natural to use different verbs to describe what happened to the king and the tree, you should do that here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and as the tree</span> <u>grew</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">strong,</span> you also <u>became</u> strong</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages you may have to indicate in what way the king had become strong. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your kingdom has become powerful</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have increased/grown in power and authority.</p></blockquote><h4>4:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>your greatness has grown to reach the sky,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You have become as great as anyone ever could.</p></li><li><p>You have become more and more important so that now everyone in the world knows how important you are.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your greatness has grown to reach the sky:</strong> In this verse part, Daniel explained what he meant in 4:22b when he said that the king had grown or “become great.” He used figurative language to explain this. This expression probably means that the king’s reputation had become greater than that of any other king. Everyone on earth knew how important he was. There were no limits to his fame. There are two ways to translate this figurative language:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>keeping the figure of speech. You may use either <em>sky</em> or “heaven,” whichever you used in 4:11a. See the note there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your greatness has increased and reaches to heaven (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your glorious reputation has reached heaven (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your royal majesty reaches sky-high<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Message</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>translating the meaning of the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are greater than any mortal man</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your fame is worldwide</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your greatness:</strong> The word <em>greatness</em> here refers to the king’s fame, reputation, or importance.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>has grown:</strong> See the Notes on “have grown” at 4:22b.</p><h4>4:22d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Your kingdom has become so powerful that now you rule everywhere on earth.</p></li><li><p>You have become more and more powerful until now you rule over people who live in the farthest places.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth:</strong> Daniel explained what he meant in 4:22b when he said that the king had become “strong.” The king now ruled everywhere, to the farthest places on earth. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your power reaches the most distant part of the world. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have authority over the farthest places of the world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You rule over people who live everywhere on earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dominion:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>dominion</em> is a synonym to “kingdom.” Like the word “kingdom” it can have different meanings. In this context it can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rule (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>power to rule</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>empire (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You rule</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the ends of the earth:</strong> See the Notes at 4:11b. The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>the ends of the earth</em> is an idiom which means “everywhere on earth.” If you have another expression or an idiom in your language that has this meaning you can use it here.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:22c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate 4:22c–d using just one verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your greatness <u>reaches</u> to heaven, and your authority to the ends of the earth.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:22b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be natural to repeat the information in 4:22b–d. If that is true in your language, you may be able to combine the four parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your reputation has become so great that everyone on earth knows about you. Your power has increased so much that you rule over people who live in the farthest places.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your glorious reputation has reached heaven, and your kingdom covers the earth. (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004019\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004023\"><h3>Paragraph 4:19–23</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Daniel began to interpret the king’s dream.</p></div><h4>4:23a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:23a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And you, O king, saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">And then</span> Your Majesty, you saw a watcher, an angel, who was coming down from heaven.</p></li><li><p>¶ “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">In the dream,</span> my king, you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> saw one of the holy angels coming down from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God in</span> heaven. He was alert and watchful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And you, O king, saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven:</strong> Daniel began to interpret the second part of the king’s dream (see 4:13). In the Aramaic text this verse part is connected to the previous verse with a word that the BSB translates as <em>And</em>. This introduces the topic of this verse. Other ways to begin this verse include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So next Your Majesty saw one of God’s messengers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for the king seeing a holy sentinel coming down from heaven (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then you saw a holy angel come down from heaven (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Introduce this second part of the dream in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the dream you also saw…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And you, O king, saw:</strong> See the Notes at 4:13a. In the Aramaic text Daniel addressed the king in the third person: “the king saw.” If this is not natural in your language you may use the second person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Also, your majesty, you saw (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O king, you saw (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You saw (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a watcher, a holy one:</strong> See the Notes on these two phrases at 4:13b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 4:13b, the two expressions refer to the same being. If this is not clear, you may wish to combine them into one expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an angel (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a holy angel (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>coming down from heaven:</strong> In his dream the king saw the angel descending from the sky. This was where he understood God to have his dwelling. The angel was coming from God. See the Notes at 4:13c, and translate here as you did there.</p><h4>4:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and saying: ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He commanded, ‘Cut down<sup>(plur)</sup> the tree and destroy it!</p></li><li><p>He declared, ‘The tree must be cut down and destroyed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and saying:</strong> Daniel then quoted what the angel had said in the king’s dream. Translate in a way that is natural in your language for introducing a quotation within a quotation. You may wish to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He said (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He commanded that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the General Comment on 4:23.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Cut down the tree:</strong> See the Notes at 4:14a. Translate in a way that clearly refers back to that command.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and destroy it:</strong> In Daniel 4:14a–b the holy one gave specific commands: “chop off its branches,” “strip off its leaves,” and “scatter its fruit.” Here Daniel summarized what the watcher had said in one short command. In some languages it may emphasize the idea if it is translated as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Destroy it! (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>destroy:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>destroy</em> is a general word that can refer to ruining buildings, kingdoms, or people. Try to use an expression that can refer to ruining or destroying both trees and people.</p><h4>4:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but leave the stump with its roots in the ground, and a band of iron and bronze around it, in the tender grass of the field.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Leave<sup>(plur)</sup> the stump in the field of grass.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But leave the stump and its roots in the ground. Secure it with an iron and bronze chain in the grass of the field. (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>4:23d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:23d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Make<sup>(plur)</sup> him become wet from the dew.</p></li><li><p>He will/must become wet from the dew.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven:</strong> The BSB has changed here from using the pronoun it/its to using the pronoun <em>him</em>. The dream begins to refer to the king rather than to the tree. The Aramaic text does not make the change clear; it is gradual. Several English versions make the change at this point. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and let him be wet with the dew of heaven (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some versions continue with to use the pronoun “it/its” in this verse part. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let it get wet with the dew from the sky. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let it become damp with the dew of the sky. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let it be drenched by the dew (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider where it is most natural to make the change. You may wish to follow your national or major-language version here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>Let…be drenched</em> is a passive command. See the Notes at 4:15c and see how you translated it there. There are several ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and let him be bathed with the dew of heaven (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let him become wet with dew. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let the dew fall on this man. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>4:23e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:23e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and graze with the beasts of the field</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Make<sup>(plur)</sup> him live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">outdoors</span> with the wild animals.</p></li><li><p>He will/must make his home <span data-bnType=\"implied\">outside</span> with/like the wild animals/beasts.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and graze with the beasts of the field:</strong> See the Notes at 4:15d. At this point the angel seems to be speaking of a human rather than a tree. This person was to live outdoors, in the “tender grass of the field,” like an animal. It may be helpful to follow the GNT and make the location explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let him live <u>there</u> with the animals (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the beasts of the field:</strong> The same Aramaic word for animals is used as in 4:15d, but here there is also the phrase <em>of the field</em>. See how you translated the word there.</p><h4>4:23f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:23f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>till seven times pass him by.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He must stay this way for seven periods of time.’</p></li><li><p>He will/must live like this for seven years.’</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>till seven times pass him by:</strong> See the Notes at 4:16c. Follow the same interpretation here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for seven time periods (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:23</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part contains an embedded quotation. Daniel reported what the holy one had said in the king’s dream. In some languages it may be natural to translate this embedded quotation using indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The holy one said that the tree must be cut down and destroyed. Its stump however, was to remain in the ground, bound with iron and bronze. The dew, he said, must make him wet. He was to live with the wild animals for seven time periods.</p></blockquote></div>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004024\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004026\"><h3>Paragraph 4:24–26</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Daniel interpreted for the king the events of his dream.

Introduce the interpretation in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages no connector will be necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You will be driven away from mankind:</strong> The Aramaic expression is more literally “they will be chasing you from among men.” The BSB translates this as a passive clause. The GW also uses a passive verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will be forced away from people (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they (indefinite) will force you to live away from people<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>La Bible du Semeur has: “On te chassera du milieu des humains.”</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people will banish you from human society</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The subject is not in focus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from mankind:</strong> In this context, the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mankind</em> refers to people in general.

Here again it has the stronger sense of recognize or understand. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until you realize (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until you have learned (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>until you acknowledge</em> means “until the time comes when you acknowledge.” When Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged that God was the Supreme King, then the seven periods of time would be over and the situation would change. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>then you will learn (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then you will admit (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before you understand (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind:</strong> The king would finally realize that God was the ultimate ruler of the earth. He controlled all things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Most High:</strong> See the Notes at 4:2b. In this context, however, as in 4:24b, the expression does not occur with the word “God.” In some languages it may be necessary to make the word “God” explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Supreme God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God Most High (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Most High God (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rules over:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>rules</em> is literally “powerful, mighty,” or “is lord over.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (1996) cites Daniel 4:17, 25, 32, 5:21 with this sense. See also GeCL97; BFCL88.</span></span> Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rules (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has power over (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>controls (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>over the kingdom of mankind:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>the kingdom of mankind</em> is singular. It is more literally “the kingdom of men” and refers to human rule in general. See 4:17c. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human sovereignty (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human kingdoms (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every kingdom on earth (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>kingdom:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>kingdom</em> is used twice in 4:3c. See the Notes and your translation of this verse part.</p><h4>4:25g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:25g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and gives it to whom He wishes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that he is able to give these kingdoms to whomever he wants.</p></li><li><p>and he decides who is going to rule them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and gives it to whom He wishes:</strong> See 4:17d. In this context the verb <em>gives</em> indicates that God is <u>able to give</u> human kingdoms to anyone he wants. God decides who should rule. See how you translated 4:17d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he can give them to anyone he chooses (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>chooses their rulers (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>it</em> probably refers to the idea of human sovereignty, human kingdoms. Refer back to this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those kingdoms (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to whom He wishes:</strong> See the Notes at 4:17d. The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates <em>He wishes</em> in this context means “decides, chooses.” God is free to appoint anyone to rule.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:25f–g</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In your translation of 4:25f–g it is good to distinguish between the final authority of God and the temporary and lesser authority of human rulers. Avoid saying something like “God rules all human kingdoms and he chooses as ruler whoever he wants.” Instead, you should distinguish between the two types of authority by saying something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God Most High controls all earthly kingdoms and chooses their rulers (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Most High has power over human kingdoms and…gives them to whomever he wishes (GW)</p></blockquote></div>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004024\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004026\"><h3>Paragraph 4:24–26</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Daniel interpreted for the king the events of his dream. He explained what the dream foretold.</p></div><h4>4:26a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:26a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As for the command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The command that the stump and its roots remain/stay in the ground</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the angel</span> ordered that no one should dig up the stump and/or roots of the tree.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As for the command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots:</strong> This verse part introduces the third part of Daniel’s interpretation. See the Notes at 4:23c. Here Daniel identified the part of the dream he was about to interpret. The BSB translates the Aramaic connecter that begins this verse as <em>As for</em>. The NJB translates the Aramaic connector this way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>And</u> the order “Leave the stump and roots of the tree”… (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This command stands in contrast to the previous commands. Part of the tree was to remain standing. Some versions therefore use a connector that indicates contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>But</u> he gave orders not to disturb the stump and roots (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>But</u> the stump and roots of the tree were left in the ground. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Connect these verse parts in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the command:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>the command</em> is more literally a verb, “they said.” The pronoun “they” is indefinite. However, in verse 15, the king said it was the angel who gave the order. So you can translate:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it was commanded (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The angel ordered… (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The holy one commanded…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to leave the stump of the tree with its roots:</strong> See the Notes at 4:15a. This is the content of the command.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The text does not say who the holy one told to do this. The agent of the action is not in focus. If this is not natural in your language, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that they (indefinite) leave the stump in the ground</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that no one should dig up the stump in the ground</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that the stump should stay in the ground</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:26a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this command as direct speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the order, “Leave the stump and roots of the tree”… (NJB)</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:26b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:26b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>your kingdom will be restored to you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>indicates/signifies that you<sup>(sing)</sup> will receive your kingdom back.</p></li><li><p>This means that you<sup>(sing)</sup> will again rule as king of/in Babylon,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions supply the word “means” or the phrase “This means” at the beginning of this verse. The Aramaic does note contain either of these but because 4:26b explains the meaning of 4:26a you may need to follow the example of these English versions and supply this implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This means… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your kingdom will be restored to you:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>will be restored</em> is more literally “will remain/endure for/to you.” In some languages it may be possible to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will continue to rule</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages however a literal translation might indicate that Nebuchadnezzar would rule without ever stopping. And in this context the verb “will remain/endure” refers to the fact that Nebuchadnezzar would <u>again</u> rule the kingdom or empire of Babylonia. He would become king of Babylon once more. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your kingdom will be given back to you (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will receive your kingdom back again (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it is certain you will rule again</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you will become king again (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will let you become king again.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your kingdom:</strong> See the Notes on <em>kingdom</em> at 4:3c. In this context, <em>kingdom</em> refers to the king’s authority to rule over the Babylonian empire.</p><h4>4:26c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:26c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This will happen when you<sup>(sing)</sup> realize/recognize that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> in heaven rules <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everywhere/earth</span>.</p></li><li><p>after/once you<sup>(sing)</sup> understand that God is the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greatest/highest</span> ruler.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven rules:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>as soon as you acknowledge</em> introduces the condition for the fulfillment of the previous clause. It refers to a time in the future when the king would <em>acknowledge</em> that God is the true King. See also 4:25f where the same phrase is used. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>once you recognize that God is lord over all</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you acknowledge that God rules all the world (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you recognize that God is the highest lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as soon as you acknowledge that:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>as soon as you acknowledge that</em> is more literally “when you will know that.” Other ways to translate this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>after you learn that (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>after you recognize (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the time that you learn that (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Heaven rules:</strong> The phrase <em>Heaven rules</em> means that God has authority over all human kingdoms. See the Notes at 4:17c. The same verb is used here. But here Daniel used the name of the place, <em>Heaven</em>, instead of the name of the person who lived there.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 113) notes that this is the only place in the Old Testament where this figure occurs. It is later used in the books of Maccabees and in the New Testament.</span></span> In many languages it will be more natural to say explicitly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who rules from heaven is in control (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God in heaven has true/final authority</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to say explicitly what or whom God rules. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God rules all the world (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God rules <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everywhere/everyone</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one in heaven rules your kingdom (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:26b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 4:26b and c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>26a</sup>The command to leave the stump with its roots in the ground means that <sup>26c</sup>once you acknowledge that God is sovereign, <sup>26b</sup>you will receive your kingdom back.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>26a</sup>The command to leave the stump and its roots in the ground indicates/signifies that <sup>26c</sup>after/when you recognize/admit that God rules <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all</span>, <sup>26b</sup>you will again rule your country.</p></blockquote></div>",

Based on his interpretation of the dream, Daniel hoped the king would accept his advice and repent from his sins. See the Notes at 2:6a and 2:9e. Introduce Daniel’s concluding advice in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is why (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So then (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>may my advice be pleasing to you:</strong> The Aramaic clause is more literally “Let my advice be acceptable to you,” as in the RSV. Daniel was expressing a polite request. He asked the king to do what he was going to recommend. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Please accept my advice (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Please listen to me (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>follow my advice (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my advice:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>my advice</em> means, “the counsel I am going to give” or, “what I recommend that you do.” Daniel gave this advice immediately after, in 4:27b–c. In some languages it may be natural to make it clear that he was referring to future advice by saying something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the following advice</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what I am about to say<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O king:</strong> See the Notes at 2:4b, 2:29a, and 4:22a.

(CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Stop sinning, do what is right (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Break away from your sins:</strong> In this context the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>Break away</em> has two possible meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It can mean “break away from something,” that is, “stop doing something.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BDB: “to tear away, break off.” See Cornelis Van Dam. <em>prq</em> TDOTTE III: 694. Van Dam says, “In Aram. the root can also signify separating oneself from sin.” Baldwin (p. 114) cites Genesis 27:40 and Exodus 32:2 as support that the phrase means, “to break with old habits.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Stop sinning (NLT) <em>(BSB, RSV, NJB, GW, NCV, GNT, NLT, CEV, KJV, NASB, ESV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It can mean “atone for.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>LXX, S, Vg, NEB, Collins, p. 212. HALOT has “to remove, wipe away.” The LXX has: “to redeem.” However, see also Lucas, p. 101. Lucas explains that the verb <em>prq</em> can mean “redeem” when the object is the thing redeemed. That is not the case here. Similarly, Goldingay, p. 81.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Atone for your sins (NRSV) <em>(NJPS, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Renounce your sins (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>break with your sins (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Turn from your sins (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>your sins:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>sins</em> is a general term for acts that do not please God. You may be able to translate this as an action.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>sinning (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>doing what is wrong<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>GeCL97.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by doing what is right:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>by doing what is right</em> is more literally “by righteousness.” The term “righteousness” here refers to righteous living, behavior that pleases God. In this context this includes generosity, justice, and fulfilling one’s duties and responsibilities. Daniel told the king to replace his sins with these good deeds. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as an independent clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and do what is right (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and start living right (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Put an end to doing evil things. Be kind to the poor/needy.</p></li><li><p>Stop doing wrong things. Start doing good to those who are wretched.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and from your iniquities:</strong> The verb “renounce” or “break away from” is implied from 4:27b. In some languages it may be necessary to supply a verb here so that the meaning is clear. If that is true in your language, you may use the same verb as in 4:27b or a close synonym. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Stop doing wicked things (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>iniquities:</strong> This is a synonym to “sinning” in 4:27b. It refers to doing wrong things, evil deeds.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harry F. van Rooy, <em>ʿwh</em> NIDOTTE 6:340.</span></span> English versions have:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wickedness (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>crimes (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wicked things (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not have a synonym for sin, you may be able to use the same word twice. Daniel said the same thing in two different ways in order to emphasize it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by showing mercy to the oppressed:</strong> The phrase <em>by showing mercy to the oppressed</em> indicates what the king <u>should</u> do. Daniel told him to replace his iniquities with mercy. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and be kind to the poor (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by being kind to the oppressed (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The expression <em>showing mercy to the oppressed</em> is a specific example of “doing what is right” in 4:27b. It means to act in a merciful way toward people in need. It implies giving them what they need, rather than just thinking of them in a kindly way. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be merciful to the poor (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>show kindness to those in need</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the oppressed:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the oppressed</em> is a general word referring to poor people, those lacking the basic necessities of life. Other ways to translate this idea in English include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the poor (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the needy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those in want</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:27b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 4:27c repeats the same idea as 4:27b but is more specific. It explains 4:27b by giving a specific example of righteousness or right behavior. In some languages it may be more natural to combine these two parts of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>27b-c</sup>Stop sinning and start living right. Be kind to the poor.</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It may be that then you will continue to be successful.”</p></li><li><p>Perhaps then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will allow</span> you to keep on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">living/ruling</span> with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> prosperity/success.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity:</strong> Daniel said that the king could continue to prosper if he turned from his sins. There are two interpretations of this expression:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces a possible result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Perhaps then you will continue to prosper. (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, KJV, RSV/NRSV, GW, NLT, REB, NCV, NJPS, NASB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It introduces a certain result. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then you will continue to be prosperous (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions. The Aramaic text suggests the idea of doubt or possibility rather than certainty.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your prosperity may be prolonged (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Perhaps your prosperity will be prolonged. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>there will be an extension of your prosperity:</strong> The abstract noun <em>prosperity</em> refers to the idea of being successful in some way: depending on the context, happy, healthy, powerful, or respected.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT. Lucas (p. 99) translates “well-being.” This is the same word that was used in 4:4 to describe the King’s state before the dream.</span></span> In this context, it refers primarily to Nebuchadnezzar’s reign in Babylon, his power and fame. In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you might continue <u>to be successful</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you may continue <u>to</u> prosper <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as ruler</span></p></blockquote>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004028\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004030\"><h3>Paragraph 4:28–30</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Nebuchadnezzar described in the third person what happened to him twelve months later.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004028\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004030\"><h3>Paragraph 4:28–30</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph Nebuchadnezzar described in the third person what happened to him twelve months later. In some languages it may be more natural to include a first-person pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All this happened to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span>, King Nebuchadnezzar….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you decide to translate using the first person, you will need to continue doing so throughout this paragraph.</p></div><h4>4:30a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Is this not Babylon the Great, which I myself have built by the might of my power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It functions as an exclamation or strong statement. The king did not expect an answer. He was boasting to himself as he admired what he had done. There are several ways to translate this verse:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is this not magnificent Babylon, which I have built as a royal capital by my mighty power and for my glorious majesty? (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an exclamation, or an exclamation with a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Just look at this wonderful capital city that I have built by my own power and for my own glory! (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look how great Babylon is! I built the royal palace by my own impressive power and for my glorious honor. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look at this great city of Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal residence to display my majestic splendor. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement or statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have built this great Babylon as my royal home. I built it by my power to show my glory and my majesty. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>4:30a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:30a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The king boasted to himself: “There is the great city of Babylon.</p></li><li><p>I said to myself: “Babylon is a magnificent city!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the king exclaimed:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>exclaimed</em> is literally “answering and saying.” See the Notes at 4:19c. The two verbs of speech indicate that the king was about to say something important. It appears that the king was alone at the time and was boasting to himself as he looked at the beautiful city of Babylon. His boast was in the form of a rhetorical question. Introduce this boastful question in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the king boasted to himself:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king reflected and said (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was saying to myself (CEV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Similarly, the GeCL97.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Is this not Babylon the Great…?:</strong> In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a positive statement or exclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is the great city of Babylon!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look how great Babylon is! (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Just look at this great city of Babylon! (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Babylon the Great:</strong> The king admired Babylon by saying that it was <em>Great</em>. Use a word appropriate for praising a city for its beauty, size, and strength. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>magnificent Babylon (NRSV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:30b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:30b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which I myself have built by the might of my power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I designed it as my capital city</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have built it</span> by my own great power to show everyone how glorious and important I am.”</p></li><li><p>I had it built to be worthy of me, a king. I in my great strength caused it to rise/exist! It shows what a glorious/amazing king I am!”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I myself have built…as a royal residence:</strong> The emphasis is on the pronoun <em>I</em>. However, the king did not build the city by himself in a physical or literal sense. He may have planned it and designed some of the buildings and gardens himself, and then ordered his workers to build them. There are at least two ways you can translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the verb literally:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I built it as a place for me to live as king</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Add the implied information of who actually built the city. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I myself <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ordered</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my workers</span> to build it as the place where I, the king, should live.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate that the king was the cause of the action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have caused it to be built for my residence</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my workers</span> to build it to be the royal city</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as a royal residence:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates <em>as a royal residence</em> is literally “a house of the kingdom” (KJV). In this context it probably refers to the city of Babylon as a whole. It is good to translate this using an expression that refers to the town where the king lives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as my capital city (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as my royal home (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to be the royal city</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the might of my power…and for the glory of my majesty:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar boasted that the beautiful city of Babylon displayed his power and majesty. It was his achievement. He wanted to receive all the praise and credit for it. He wanted all who saw it to recognize that he was a powerful and important ruler. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to display my power and might, my glory and majesty (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to show how very powerful I am and how worthy of honor</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by the might of my power:</strong> The expression that the BSB translates as <em>by the might of my power</em> indicates that Nebuchadnezzar thought that he was able to build the city because he was powerful. The city was evidence of his power. Its existence displayed how powerful he was. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>using my great strength</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because I am so strong and powerful</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>might of my power:</strong> In the Aramaic this phrase is literally “the strength of my might.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT. The same two words occur in 2:37 but in the opposite order.</span></span> The two words “strength” and “might” are close synonyms. Used together they emphasize the king’s pride in his power. Different ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>mighty power (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>my power and might (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>by my own mighty strength (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and for the glory of my majesty:</strong> This expression tells why the king built the city of Babylon: the king wanted to show how important he was. The two words <em>glory</em> and <em>majesty</em> are close synonyms and used together they emphasize the king’s pride in his greatness. There are different ways you can translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using two nouns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to show my glory and my majesty (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a noun phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and for my glorious honor (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to display my majestic splendor (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a clause with a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that people will honor me greatly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when they see what I have done</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that people will think/know I am very great/important</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that people will give me the respect of which I am worthy</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>glory:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> here means “dignity, honor.” Some languages may not have an abstract term like this. If that is true in your language, you may need to express this idea using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>People will honor/respect me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>my majesty:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>majesty</em> is a synonym to “glory.” Nebuchadnezzar wanted to receive honor and respect for his greatness. In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>People will understand/see how important I am.</p></blockquote>",

This is a figure of speech. The king heard someone speak to him from heaven. The text implies that it was God or his angel who spoke. In some languages it may not be natural to say that <em>a voice</em> spoke. If this is the case in your language, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Someone spoke from heaven</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A heavenly being said</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I heard these words from heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The word <em>heaven</em> here refers to the place where God lives.

Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The kingdom has departed from you. (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are no longer ruler of this kingdom.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004031\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004032\"><h3>Paragraph 4:31–32</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">A voice from heaven told Nebuchadnezzar that he would receive punishment for his pride.</p></div><h4>4:32a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:32a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You will be driven away from mankind</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> will be forced to go/live far away from people</p></li><li><p>People will banish/send you<sup>(sing)</sup> from their towns/society.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You will be driven away from mankind:</strong> See the Notes on this expression at 4:25a.

The <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em> explains that it is best not to translate this as “People will make you eat grass” because the king would not be near other people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Pael participle masculine plural.

The BSB has compared Nebuchadnezzar to just a single male head of cattle.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until you realize that the Most High has power over human kingdoms (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then you will acknowledge that the Supreme God has power over human kingdoms (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Most High:</strong> See the Notes at 4:2c; 4:17c; 4:25f. In this context, however, the expression does not occur with the word “God.” In some languages it may be necessary to make the word “God” explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God Most High (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Most High God (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rules over:</strong> See the Notes at 4:25f. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>rules</em> is literally “powerful, mighty,” or “is lord over.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (1996) cites Daniel 4:17, 25, 32, 5:21 with this sense. See GeCL97 and BFCL88.</span></span> Modern versions translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has power over (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>controls (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is sovereign over (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the kingdom of mankind:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the kingdom of mankind</em> is singular. It is more literally “the kingdom of men,” as in the RSV, and it probably refers to human rule in general. See the note on 4:25f and translate it here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human sovereignty (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human kingdoms (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every kingdom on earth (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:32f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:32f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and gives it to whom He wishes.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And he is able to give human/earthly authority to anyone he wants.”</p></li><li><p>He chooses whoever he wants to rule.”</p></li><li><p>He decides who is going to be their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">earthly/human</span> king.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and gives it to whom He wishes:</strong> God can cause anyone to rule a kingdom.

While the king lived out in the open, his hair grew long. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As time went by (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He lived this way until (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and during that time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle:</strong> This Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle</em> is literally “his hair like eagles grew big/great.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>grew like:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>grew</em> is a general word that means “grow big.” In this context it refers to hair that grows long and wild, shaggy and unkempt. Use an expression that is natural in your language to refer to hair that is not cut for a long time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grew as long as (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his hair became shaggy like (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>like the feathers of an eagle:</strong> The Aramaic text does not mention <em>feathers</em>. However, the word is implied from the context and the BSB has supplied it. An <em>eagle</em> is a large flesh-eating bird. It has a large wing span and long feathers. In some cultures, people may not be familiar with eagles. In that case, you may need to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>use the term for a similar large bird. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like a vulture’s feathers</p></blockquote></li><li><p>use a general term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like the feathers of a huge bird</p></blockquote></li><li><p>translate the meaning of the comparison.

The king’s nails grew long, sharp, and curved like birds’ claws. In some cultures, people may only know about small birds and may not be familiar with birds that have long claws. In that case, you may have to translate the meaning without using this comparison. Examples of different ways to translate this expression include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his nails grew as long as birds’ claws (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his nails <span data-bnType=\"implied\">grew long,</span> like the claws of a large bird</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his nails became extremely long</p></blockquote>",

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004034\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004035\"><h3>Paragraph 4:34–35</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the king once again described what happened in his own words.

See the Notes at 4:16b-c, 4:25f. English versions have translated this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When the time was over (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At the end of the seven time periods (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When the seven years had passed (GNT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>GeCL97; BFCL88.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I, Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> See the Notes at 4:4a. The king mentioned his name to emphasize who he was and the importance of what he was about to say. In some languages it may be unnatural for someone to state his name like this. In those languages there may be another way to express this same emphasis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, the king,</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I…looked up to heaven:</strong> This is a figure of speech. It means to pray and seek God’s help. In this context, the expression implies that the king changed his attitude and recognized that God was the greatest ruler and king. He humbled himself and acknowledged God’s authority. It is important that people understand this implied meaning. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then I looked up to heaven (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I prayed to God in heaven (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I looked/turned to God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for help</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heaven:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>heaven</em> can refers to the sky, the heavens, or to the place where God lives.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GNT says: “I looked up at the sky.” However, the word has the extended sense of “the place where God lives.”</span></span> In this context the two meanings are both relevant. Nebuchadnezzar prayed looking up, toward the sky, because that was where he believed God lived.</p><h4>4:34b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:34b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and my sanity was restored to me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">As a result,</span> I became able to think clearly/normally again.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> restored my mind.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> healed me so that I could think like a human again.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces a result clause. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As a result</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my sanity was restored to me:</strong> See the Notes at 4:16a–b. The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>my sanity was restored</em> is more literally “my reason returned to me,” as in the RSV. It indicates that Nebuchadnezzar began to think like a human being again, and it implies that it was God who allowed this to happen. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My reason was restored to me (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was restored to my right mind (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My sanity returned (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my mind came back to me (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was able to think clearly again</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my sanity:</strong> See the Notes at 4:16a-b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1920 has “understanding.” The word occurs at Daniel 2:21; 4:34–37; 5:12.</span></span> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>my sanity</em> can also be translated as “my understanding” or “my reason” (RSV). Here it refers to the ability to think clearly and rationally, like a human being. Once again the king was able to think like a person and not like an animal. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an action.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and I could think normally again (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God caused me to think normally again</p></blockquote><h4>4:34c–35</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The author wrote Daniel 4:34e–35 in poetic style. In 4:34e–35 there are four pairs of clauses. The second part of each pair repeats the meaning of the first line in different way.</p><h4>4:34c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:34c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then I praised the Most High,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore I praised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> Most High.</p></li><li><p>So I blessed/glorified the Supreme <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>/One.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>Then</em> here introduces the result of 4:33a–c. The king praised God because God had allowed him to think like a human again. You can also translate introduce this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>therefore</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I praised the Most High:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>praised</em> is literally “blessed.” See the Notes at 2:19b. When humans bless God, they express praise, appreciation, thanks, and honor to him. You can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I thanked the Most High (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I blessed the Most High (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I gave/offered praises to the One/God who is over all</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Most High:</strong> See the Notes on “the Most High God” at 3:26b and 4:2b and <em>the Most High</em> at 4:17c, 4:24b, and 4:25f. This expression is a title. It describes God as having universal authority.</p><h4>4:34d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:34d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I honored and glorified Him who lives forever:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I thanked and praised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> who lives forever.</p></li><li><p>I greatly/highly praised the eternal One/<span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I honored and glorified Him who lives forever:</strong> In this verse part, the king used two other words that mean “praise.” See the notes on 2:23a, where two similar Hebrew words are used (in reverse order). The king used a total of three different verbs in order to emphasize how much he wanted to praise God. In some languages it may be natural to show this emphasis in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <u>highly exalted</u> the one who lives forever</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Him who lives forever:</strong> The phrase <em>Him who lives forever</em> is a title for God. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> , who lives for ever</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on Daniel 4:34c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be natural to repeat the same information in two clauses. The reader may think that the king was praising two different beings. If this is true in your language, you may be able to reorder the two parts and combine information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>34c,d</sup>I praised, honored and glorified the Most High God, the one who lives forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>34c-d</sup>Then I said, “God the Most High is the ever-living one! He is the one to whom I give praise, glory, and honor!”</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:34e–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 4:34e–f is also in poetic form. 4:34f says the same thing as 4:34e but in a different way. Note also that Daniel 4:34e–f is almost the same as Daniel 4:3b–c.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The only difference is that the word “dominion” and “kingdom” are in opposite lines.</span></span></p><h4>4:34e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:34e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“For His dominion is an everlasting dominion,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For he has authority to rule forever!</p></li><li><p>He will rule forever,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> This verse part begins with an Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>For</em>. In this context this connector introduces the reason why the king praised God. That is, it introduces the reason why God is worthy of praise. Some English versions leave this connector untranslated and the relationship between 4:34d–c implied. Introduce 4:34e in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His dominion is an everlasting dominion:</strong> The dominion or kingdom of God will last forever. There will never be a time when he will no longer rule his people. In some languages, you may not have an abstract expression like <em>dominion</em>. It may be more natural to translate this using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God reigns forever!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will always rule <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his people</span>!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>everlasting:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>everlasting</em> means “for all future time.” It refers to all ages yet to come. God’s kingdom is everlasting. It has no end. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will last forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will never end</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dominion:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>dominion</em> is a synonym of “kingdom.” See the Notes at 4:3c.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 4:3b–c the author reverses the two synonyms.</span></span> In this context it means: “God will have authority” or “God will rule/reign.”</p><h4>4:34f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:34f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and His kingdom endures from generation to generation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will reign over every generation of people!</p></li><li><p>king/sovereign over each <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new/future</span> generation of people!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His kingdom endures from generation to generation:</strong> This line repeats the meaning of 4:34e using different words. This repetition emphasizes the idea that God will rule for all time. Although people die and whole generations pass away, God will continue to rule. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will rule from one generation to the next.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will reign throughout all the lifetimes of human beings.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kingdom:</strong> See the Notes at 4:3c. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>kingdom</em> here refers to the act of ruling. God will rule for generation after generation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from generation to generation:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>generation</em> refers to an age group—grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren and so on. Each of these groups is a <em>generation</em>. The king declared that God would rule over each new age group that is born. In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from one human lifespan to the next</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one lifetime after another</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every baby that is born, and all their descendants</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:34d–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be natural to repeat the same information in the two clauses. If this is true in your language, you may be able to combine the two clauses into one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>34d-e</sup>and he will rule each generation of people forever</p></blockquote></div>",

For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004034\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004035\"><h3>Paragraph 4:34–35</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, the king once again described what happened in his own words. He told how he changed his attitude. He acknowledged that God was the ruler over all people.</p></div><h4>4:35a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 4:35a–b is in Aramaic poetic style. The first part states that God is more important and more powerful than all the people on earth. 4:35b further emphasizes this idea: God has control over all the angels in heaven and over all the people who live on earth.</p><h4>4:35a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:35a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All the peoples of the earth are counted as nothing,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Compared to the Most High God</span>, all the people who live on earth are completely powerless/insignificant.</p></li><li><p>How powerless/weak are all the inhabitants of the earth!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All the peoples of the earth are counted as nothing:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar was emphasizing God’s power. This verse part includes an implied comparison: all the peoples of the earth, their power and glory, are like nothing<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some ancient texts say “like/as nothing” rather than “like/as not.” In many languages there may be no difference in translation between the two options.</span></span> <u>compared to God</u> and his power and glory. In some languages it may be natural to make this comparison explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All the people of the earth are nothing <u>compared to him</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways of understanding this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The king was making a statement about <u>his own</u> attitude. He realized and stated that all the people of earth have no power in comparison to God’s power. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everyone who lives on earth is nothing compared to him (GW) <em>(GW, REB, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The king was making a statement about <u>God’s</u> attitude. God considered all the people in this world as insignificant compared to his mighty power.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See also the TH of Daniel.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He looks on the people of the earth as nothing (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To him the nations are far less than nothing. (CEV) <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Several other translations are ambiguous (BSB, NET, RSV/NRSV, NJB). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The king recognized that all human power was nothing to God’s power. Avoid implying that God does not care about people at all, or that he views them as worthless.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the peoples of the earth:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the peoples</em> is more literally “those who live.” The king was referring to every human being. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the inhabitants of the earth (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If a literal translation suggests that some people live not on earth but elsewhere, you may need to leave the phrase <em>of the earth</em> implicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human beings</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>are counted as nothing:</strong> The verb <em>are counted</em> is passive. Following interpretation (1) in the previous note, it can be translated in at least two ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are seen to be nothing</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>count for nothing</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are not truly important (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are insignificant</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>4:35b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:35b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and He does as He pleases with the army of heaven and the peoples of the earth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He does whatever he decides with angels in heaven and with people here on earth.</p></li><li><p>God has authority over both the angels in heaven and the people who live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">here</span> on earth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and He does as He pleases with the army of heaven and the peoples of the earth:</strong> This verse part indicates that God has power over all beings, those in heaven and those on earth.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He does whatever he wishes with the army of heaven and with those who live on earth.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He does whatever he wishes (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he does according to his will (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God does what he wants (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>as He pleases:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>as He pleases</em> is another form of the verb the BSB translates as “He wishes” in 4:17d, 4:25g, 4:32f.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1962.</span></span> In this context, the word implies deliberate action or choice. God acts exactly as he chooses to act. He does whatever he decides to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the army of heaven:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB literally translates as <em>the army of heaven</em><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1875. See also Daniel 3:20.</span></span> probably refers, in this context, to the supernatural beings who live with God in heaven. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>angels in heaven (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and the peoples of the earth:</strong> See the Notes at 4:35a. The same phrase is used here. Other ways English versions translate this expression are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the inhabitants of the earth (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everyone on this earth (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who live on earth (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:35c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:35c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>There is no one who can restrain His hand</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No one can stop him from doing something.</p></li><li><p>No one is powerful enough to prevent God from acting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as he chooses</span>.</p></li><li><p>There is no one who can oppose the Most High God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There is no one who can restrain His hand:</strong> This is the first clause of the fourth pair of clauses in the king’s speech. The phrase <em>His hand</em> is a metaphorical way of referring to God’s power. This entire clause is a figure of speech indicating that no one can stop God from doing as he chooses. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one can stop his powerful hand (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning in a non-figurative way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no one who can oppose him (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one can stop him or challenge him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When God does something, no one can change it (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate the meaning in the way that is most natural in your language. In some languages the use of the figure <em>His hand</em> may not be natural. And in some languages it will cause your readers to assume that God has a physical body with physical hands. If this is the case in your language, you should translate the meaning of the figure.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>can restrain His hand:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>can restrain</em> literally means “strike.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT. 1914.</span></span> When someone strikes someone on the arm, it hinders or stops them from doing something. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>slaps his hand (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>4:35d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:35d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No one can ask him, “Why did you do that?”</p></li><li><p>Nor does anyone have the right to ask him why he did something.</p></li><li><p>and no one can question/criticize his actions/motives.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>or</em> here introduces a second thing that people cannot do. They cannot rebuke God for what he chooses to do. Translate this connector in a natural way in your language. In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and</u> says to him… (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>say to Him, ‘What have You done?’:</strong> No human being or supernatural being has the right to rebuke God for his actions. No one has the right to demand an explanation. They <u>can</u>, but God does not have to answer. There is no one with the right to judge God, no one to whom he is obliged to explain his actions. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>say to him, “What do you mean by doing these things?” (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>or say to him, “Explain why you have done this.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>say to Him:</strong> What follows is a question. So in some languages it may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ask him (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>question him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>‘What have You done?’:</strong> This is a question demanding that God explain why he acted as he did. It is not respectful or humble. Try to translate it in a way that is judgmental and arrogant. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Why did you do that?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Explain your actions!</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:35d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse part contains a quotation within a quotation.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.

When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence.

The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004036\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004037\"><h3>Paragraph 4:36–37</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">After the king repented, he was able to think and act like a human again.</p></div><h4>4:36a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The Aramaic text on 4:36 can be interpreted in two main ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It indicates that when the king’s sanity returned, he received back his position as king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When my sanity returned, my honor, my majesty, and the glory of my kingdom were given back to me. (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that when the king honored God, two things happened: his sanity returned, and he became king again. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At that time my sanity returned to me. I was restored to the honor of my kingdom, and my splendor returned to me. (ESV) <em>(NET, NRSV/RSV, NJB, ESV, REB, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">The two interpretations are not very different. The difference is more one of emphasis. If you must choose between them, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). 4:34b has already told how the king’s sanity returned. This happened when he first looked up to God in heaven (4:34a). This verse refers back to that event and indicates that because of it Nebuchadnezzar was able to receive his royal throne back again.</p><h4>4:36a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:36a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>At the same time my sanity was restored,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ When/As God restored/healed my mind,</p></li><li><p>¶ So I began to think normally/clearly again. At the same time</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>At the same time my sanity was restored:</strong> The expression that the BSB translates as <em>At the same time my sanity was restored</em> refers back to 4:34b. This was the time when the king looked up to heaven (4:34a) and acknowledged that God had authority over the kingdoms of men (4:34–35). Other ways to translate this idea include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When my sanity returned to me (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I began to think clearly again, and right/soon after that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>At the same time:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>At the same time</em> is literally “at the/that time.” The BSB has supplied the word <em>same</em>. In this context the phrase refers to the same general time period. The events were closely linked and followed soon after one another.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my sanity was restored:</strong> This refers to the time when the king began to think like a human being again. See the Notes at 4:34b. Translate it here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my mind came back to me (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my reason returned to me (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I could think normally again (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:36b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:36b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my honor and splendor returned to me</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>people again began to honor me as king.

People were in awe of the great things I did.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my honor and splendor returned to me:</strong> This is a passive clause. It indicates that Nebuchadnezzar received back the <em>honor</em> and <em>splendor</em> that he had previously had. God caused people to honor him once more. It may be more natural in some languages to use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I received once again great honor and power</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God caused people to honor and admire me again.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God gave back my great honor and power. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my honor:</strong> See the Notes at 4:30b. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>honor</em> here refers to how important and great the king was in the view of other people.

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>officials (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nobles:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>nobles</em> refers to influential people or dignitaries in the Babylonian court.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1978.</span></span> Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>officers (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:36e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:36e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I was restored to my throne,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I again received the right to rule over my kingdom.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> restored to me the authority to reign as king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over Babylon</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I was restored to my throne:</strong> The Aramaic text of this verse part is more literally “and concerning/over my kingdom, it was established.” English versions agree that this indicates that Nebuchadnezzar again began to reign over Babylonia.

There are two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a passive verb, as the BSB has done.

These Notes are based on the BSB, which is based on the Aramaic text called the MT (Masoretic Text). However, the early Greek translation known as the Septuagint is different from the Aramaic text in many places in Daniel 4. Scholars are uncertain why the two are so different. It may be that the Greek translators worked from an Aramaic text that was different from that of the MT. The Notes will discuss the differences between the two texts for certain important passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers of the BSB and most English versions are different from the verse numbers in the Aramaic text. The NJPS and NJB are two exceptions. They follow the verse numbers in the Aramaic text.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (p. 107) notes that the chapter divisions in the present Aramaic text were not necessarily those of the original text.</span></span> The difference in numbering can cause confusion when citing verses in different translations. For example, Daniel 4:1 in the BSB is 3:31 in the NJPS and NJB. Daniel 4:4 is 4:1 in the NJB and NJPS, and so on. When these Notes cite verses in the NJPS and the NJB, they will give both the verse numbers in those versions and the corresponding BSB verse numbers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Versions give different headings to Daniel 4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s second dream (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a tree (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A letter from Nebuchadnezzar about his insanity (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural that the heading be a full sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a second dream</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar dreamed about a tree</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nebuchadnezzar wrote a letter about how he became insane</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. <u>Change of Speaker</u>: In Daniel 4, the person who tells the story varies between the king and the narrator. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">A. In 4:1–18 the king told what happened to him in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">B. In 4:19–27 the narrator told the story of how Daniel interpreted the king’s dream.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">C. In 4:28–33 the narrator told what happened to Nebuchadnezzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">D. In 4:34–37 the king again spoke directly in the first person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Notes will inform you when there is a change of speaker and suggest how to translate these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. <u>Repetition</u>: When Daniel interpreted the king’s dream (4:19–27), he repeated parts of what the king had previously told him (in 4:10–16). Later, when the narrator told what happened to the king (4:28–33), he repeated what Daniel had said would happen (in 4:25). This kind of repetition creates suspense in the story. Repetition also helps to emphasize the main theme of the account. For example, at the end of the account, the king repeated information from the beginning (4:3, 34). This information is the theme of the chapter: God is sovereign over human rulers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. <u>Synonyms:</u> The author liked to use synonyms, different words with the same or similar meaning. In some cases, he used synonyms to emphasize an idea. For example, in 4:37 the king used three synonyms in the same sentence to emphasize the idea of praise. In some languages this may not be natural. The Notes will suggest other ways you can translate synonyms.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. <u>Commands</u>: In the dream, the angel made a number of commands. The text does not usually say to whom the angel was giving these commands. Sometimes the angel commanded non-living objects to do something. In all these cases, the angel was speaking a message from God. And when God commands that something happen, it will certainly happen. In some languages it may not be natural to use commands in this way. If that is true in your language, you may be able to translate these commands as authoritative declarations. The Notes will give examples of how you may do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">5. <u>Poetic Parallelism:</u> The author of Daniel 4 liked to use poetic form to communicate ideas. In Aramaic poetry, authors often used pairs of clauses to say the same thing in two different ways. This type of poetry has many different functions. Sometimes the author used poetry to emphasize themes. Other times he used poetry to mark the climax of a section. This kind of poetry may not be natural in your language. The Notes will describe the function of the poetic speech in Daniel. They will also suggest some options on how you might translate this type of poetry in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">6. <u>Form</u>: The author wrote Daniel 4 in the form of a royal proclamation. This proclamation form gives authority to the account. The style of the proclamation is similar to that of a letter, and the beginning of the chapter is similar to other Aramaic letters. The king first identifies himself. Second, he indicates to whom he is writing, that is, those he intends to read his letter. Third, he greets his readers. In your language, people may have a different way of identifying the author or addressee of a letter. The Notes will suggest some options on how to translate this letter style.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">7. <u>Key Terms</u>: Two key terms in Daniel 4 are “earth” and “heaven.” Both words have more than one meaning. The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “earth” can mean either “ground,” “land,” or “world.” The Aramaic word that the BSB generally translates as “heaven” can mean either “sky” or “where God lives.” In 4:26 the author used the word “Heaven” to refer to God himself. The author plays on these two words and their meanings to highlight the main theme of the chapter: “God in heaven rules over the affairs of men on earth.” The Notes will explain the meaning of these two key terms in each context.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027004036\" data-endVerseId=\"1027004037\"><h3>Paragraph 4:36–37</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">After the king repented, he was able to think and act like a human again.</p></div><h4>4:37a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:37a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and honor and glorify the King who rules in heaven.</p></li><li><p>¶ That is why, I, the king, greatly/highly praise and honor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> who reigns in heaven,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>Now</em> is an adverb that indicates time. See also 2:23c, 3:15a. In this context, it also introduces a result clause. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. Other ways English versions translate this idea are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So now (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That’s why I say (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I, Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> See the Notes at 4:4a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The king spoke in the first person in Daniel 4:1–18.</span></span> The king mentioned his name to emphasize the importance of what he was about to say. If it is unnatural in your language for someone to state his name in this way, you may have another way to express this same emphasis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, the king,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven:</strong> The king used three words to emphasize how greatly he honored God. In some languages it may be unnatural to use three synonyms like this. If this is the case in your language, you may be able to use one or two verbs with the same meaning. It is important to keep the same emphasis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with my whole heart I praise God, who rules in heaven.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I give highest praises to the King who rules in heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>praise:</strong> See the Notes at 2:23a; 4:34c, and see how you translated this word there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>exalt:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>exalt</em> means “lift up, praise.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glorify:</strong> See the Notes at 4:34d. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>glorify</em> is a synonym to “praise” and “exalt.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the King of heaven:</strong> King Nebuchadnezzar called God <em>the King of heaven</em>. You can also say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king who rules in heaven (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, who rules in heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>heaven:</strong> In this context, the word <em>heaven</em> refers to the place where God lives, the supernatural realm.</p><h4>4:37b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:37b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for all His works are true</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because everything that God does is right</p></li><li><p>for God does everything according to what is true</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> introduces three reasons why the king praised God. Introduce these reasons in a way that is natural in your language. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all His works are true:</strong> God always acts in a way that is good and right. He never makes mistakes or fails to act justly. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Everything that God has done is right</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God does everything according to what is right.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all His works:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB literally translates as <em>all His works</em> refers to the things that God does or has done, his activity. You can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all that God does</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everything he does (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all his deeds/actions</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>true:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>true</em> means, in this context, “in accordance with what is right or true.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>right (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>GeCL97</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>4:37c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:37c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and all His ways are just.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and all his actions are just</p></li><li><p>and just/fair.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 4:37c is in parallelism to 4:37b. The two parts express different aspects of the same meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and all His ways are just:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>His ways</em> is literally “his paths.” It is used figuratively to speak of God’s activity in the world. In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the way God does things is just</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>just:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>just</em> is a close synonym to “truth” in 4:37b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Aramaic word here is <em>diyn</em>. HALOT, 1852 has: “justice.” The KJV has: “judgment.” However, the latter does not fit the context.</span></span> Here it has the sense of “fair.” English versions translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>right (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fair (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:37b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to combine these two parts into one:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b-c</sup>Everything that God does is right and just.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b-c</sup>All God’s deeds are completely just/fair.</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:37d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:37d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And He is able to humble those who walk in pride.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And he is able to humble those who live with a proud heart/mind.</p></li><li><p>He humiliates those who act in an arrogant way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates <em>And</em> here introduces the third reason why the king praised God. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who walk in pride:</strong> The verb <em>walk</em> here refers to a customary or habitual manner of living. God is able to humble anyone and everyone who thinks and acts in an arrogant, prideful way. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who behave arrogantly (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>anyone who is full of pride</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in pride:</strong> In this context, the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>pride</em> has a negative sense. The word describes a person who thinks he is more important than he is. In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea using an adverb or adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>arrogantly (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with arrogant behavior/attitude</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>thinking themselves great/big</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is able to humble:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>He is able to humble</em> is literally “he is able to make low.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he can humiliate (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">God is not just <u>able</u> to humble proud people, but he actually does so. If a literal translation would mean that God is only <u>able</u> to do so, it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he brings down those who live in a high/arrogant way</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God will humiliate proud people</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:37d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the phrases in 4:37d.

He wrote about how King Belshazzar gave a big banquet and made use of the sacred treasures from the Jerusalem temple. Belshazzar saw a hand writing a mysterious message on the wall. Only Daniel was able to explain the message, that God was about to punish Belshazzar.

From other historic sources we know that Cyrus, the king of Persia, attacked the Babylonian army during the 7th month of the year 539 B.C. On the 15th day of that month, they attacked the town of Sippar and King Nabonidus fled. The next day Cyrus’ army entered the city of Babylon without any battle and killed its ruler, Belshazzar.

In some languages it may be natural to indicate first when these events happened. The word <em>Later</em> is not in the Aramaic text but the BSB has supplied it to indicate to the reader that the events that follow took place after the previously recorded events. The events in chapter 5 took place about thirty years after the events of chapter 4. Nebuchadnezzar had died in 562 B.C. This episode takes place in 539 B.C. So you may wish to supply a time phrase such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A number of years later (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>One time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Later when Belshazzar was king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>King Belshazzar held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles:</strong> The king of Babylon ordered his servants to prepare a banquet for his guests. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Belshazzar organized/prepared a big feast for a thousand of his high officials.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Belshazzar invited a thousand noblemen to a great banquet (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>King Belshazzar:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>King Belshazzar</em> is literally “Belshazzar the king.” This is the first time the text has referred to this person. Your language may have a special way to introduce new people into a story.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>King:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>King</em> here refers to the son of the king, who was ruling in the king’s place. Belshazzar was probably acting as the king in the capital, while his father was living in another area of the empire. Use the normal word that you have used for king elsewhere in the book of Daniel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>great:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>great</em> here means “big, large, generous.” There was a lot of food and drink for the guests to enjoy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>feast:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>feast</em> literally means “bread.” Here it has the extended meaning of a meal. Use a word appropriate for a fine meal that a king might provide to important people on a special occasion. English versions also say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>festival (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>banquet (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a thousand of his nobles:</strong> The king may have had more than a thousand nobles. He invited one thousand of them to eat a meal at his palace. The number <em>a thousand</em> may be a round number for an impressive crowd rather than an exact head count.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>nobles:</strong> The Aramaic title that the BSB translates as <em>nobles</em> refers to important men who participated in the king’s court. See the Notes at 4:33. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>lords (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>noblemen (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>highest officials (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he drank wine with them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The king drank wine there in the presence of his guests.</p></li><li><p>He <span data-bnType=\"implied\">celebrated and</span> began to drink wine with the other men.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and he drank wine with them:</strong> <em>wine</em> was an alcoholic drink that people made from a fruit called grapes. People usually drank wine on special occasions, especially when there was a celebration or feast. If your culture is not familiar with wine, see the options of how to translate this expression in the Notes at 1:5a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with them:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>with them</em> is more literally “in front of” or “in the presence of.” However, this does not mean that the king was the only person drinking wine. He probably sat at a high table facing the nobles as he drank wine along with them all.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>them:</strong> The Aramaic literally says “the thousand,” referring to the noblemen mentioned in 5:1a.

Belshazzar was enjoying the wine, probably at the end of the meal. Possibly he was drunk and was not thinking clearly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NRSV says, “Under the influence of the wine….” and the CEV says, “He got drunk.” This is possible but is not stated by the author.</span></span> However, this is not stated clearly and it is best to leave this as just a possibility. For example, in English one can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>While Belshazzar was enjoying the/his wine</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a translation like that of the BSB may suggest that Belshazzar was drinking alone. If that is the case in your language, it may be necessary to say, like the GNT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>While they were drinking (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As he drank the wine</p></blockquote><h4>5:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he ordered his servants to bring to him the gold and silver vessels</p></li><li><p>he called for the gold and silver cups/bowls</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>gave orders</em> is literally “said in a decree.” Belshazzar made an order or decree that his servants bring him certain goblets made of silver and gold. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Belshazzar commanded that they bring in the vessels of gold and silver (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Belshazzar issued an order to bring in the gold and silver vessels (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and ordered his servants to bring in the gold and silver cups (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the gold and silver vessels:</strong> Workmen or artisans had made these <em>vessels</em> from <em>gold and silver</em> metals. Some of the vessels were made of gold and others were made of silver. It is implied that they were therefore beautiful and valuable. If people do not use or value gold and silver in your culture, you may:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>borrow terms from the national language. It is important that your readers understand that these metals were valuable and beautiful. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>vessels of valuable metals/materials called gold and silver</p></blockquote></li><li><p>describe these metals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>vessels made from the most beautiful and precious metals</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the treasures</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gold:</strong> See the Notes at 2:32a. This was the most precious and valuable metal that people had at that time. It was easy for people to bend and shape gold. As a result, people used gold to make coins, jewelry and different vessels.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>silver:</strong> Silver is a pale colored metal that is lighter and less valuable than gold, but still precious. In the Ancient Near East, silver was a standard of trade and a symbol of wealth. People used silver to make jewelry, coins, and decorations.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>vessels:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>vessels</em> is a general word. It can refer to a variety of different containers. In this context, it refers to containers that hold liquids. The Hebrew priest had used these containers to offer sacrifices to God. See the Notes at 1:2b. English versions translate this term in different ways.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>cups (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>cups and bowls (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>goblets (NIV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that his father/grandfather Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p>that his predecessor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">King</span> Nebuchadnezzar had removed/looted from God’s house in Jerusalem.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem:</strong> This clause refers to something that had happened over forty years before. There had been many sacred treasures in the temple. The Hebrew people had used them in their religious ceremonies. Nebuchadnezzar had ordered his men to remove some of these sacred treasures from the temple and to bring them to Babylon. See 1:2b–d. Some of these items, “the gold and silver vessels,” Belshazzar now ordered to be brought to him in the hall of feasting.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Nebuchadnezzar his father:</strong> The relationship between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar is not certain. It appears that Belshazzar was the son of King Nabonidus, who had married Nebuchadnezzar’s daughter. So in this context the word <em>father</em> can mean both “predecessor” and “ancestor” (here, grandfather).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to translate the word father here:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If your readers will understand that the term <em>father</em> can have this extended meaning, you can use it here.</p></li><li><p>You may translate it as “predecessor.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his predecessor Nebuchadnezzar (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You may translate it with a word referring to an ancestor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>had taken from the temple in Jerusalem:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>had taken</em> refers back to an action that took place forty years before the main narrative. It indicates that King Nebuchadnezzar had commanded his soldiers or servants to carry these treasures out of the temple and back to Babylon. Other ways to translate this include</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had carried off from the Temple in Jerusalem (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ordered</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his men</span> to take/steal from the Jerusalem</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had looted/confiscated from the house of God in Jerusalem</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the temple in Jerusalem:</strong> This phrase refers to the building where Jewish people worshiped God and offered sacrifices. God was present there in a special way. See the key term “temple” in KBT.</p><h4>5:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that the king could drink from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He ordered this so that he, together with his nobles/officials, wives, and concubines, could use them to drink from.</p></li><li><p>King Belshazzar wanted to be able to drink from these sacred cups/bowls—he himself and his leading/important men, his wives, and his secondary/lesser wives.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that the king could drink from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines:</strong> The king wanted to display and use the religious treasures from God’s temple. He wanted his guests to admire them and admire him for possessing them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>so that:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> here introduces a purpose clause. Introduce Nebuchadnezzar’s purpose in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He wanted to… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the king:</strong> The phrase <em>the king</em> here refers to Belshazzar himself. In some languages it may be natural to use a pronoun here. But make sure that it is clear that the pronoun refers to Belshazzar, not to Nebuchadnezzar. The GNT uses the pronoun “he.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>could drink from them:</strong> It was an act of disrespect and sacrilege to drink from the holy cups and bowls in this way. The priests of God had dedicated these vessels to God, for service in God’s temple. Now Belshazzar wanted to use them for a drinking party. This showed that he had no respect for God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures readers might not understand that it was disrespectful to drink from the cups. It may be necessary to indicate or imply this by the way you translate <em>drink from them</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>might enjoy drinking from them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>might make use of them in their drinking</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>might put them to use themselves</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>along with his nobles:</strong> See the Notes on this title at 5:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his wives, and his concubines:</strong> These two groups of women, <em>wives</em> and <em>concubines</em>, together made up the king’s harem. They were all the king’s sexual partners and could not marry anyone else.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>his wives:</strong> The king’s <em>wives</em> had the higher status. They generally brought a dowry into the marriage, their children had full inheritance rights, and if the king died they kept a position of privilege.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>and his concubines:</strong> A “concubine” was a secondary wife. The relationship was permanent and recognized, but <em>concubines</em> had lower status than the official wives. They had fewer legal rights, and the children they bore to the king also had fewer rights. A “concubine” was often a female slave whom the king purchased or took captive in a war.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, scholars disagree as to the meaning of the Aramaic word used here:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <em>concubines</em>. That is, it means wives of secondary status. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his concubines (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, RSV/NRSV, ESV, GW, GNT, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means female entertainers or slaves who were not in an official or recognized relationship with the king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the women who sang for him (NJB) <em>(NJB, NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions. In some languages it may be natural to describe the role of concubine with a phrase such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>junior/lesser wives</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wives of second rank</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that had been confiscated from the temple (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>belonging to the house of God, the temple in Jerusalem (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that they had brought from God’s temple in Jerusalem</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the house of God in Jerusalem:</strong> See the Notes on “house of God” at 1:2b. This expression is a synonym of the word “temple.” The author repeated the idea in order to emphasize the sacred nature of the goblets and the disrespect Belshazzar was showing. In some languages it may be unnatural to repeat this information in this way. If this is the case in your language, you may combine the two expressions, as the BSB has done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s temple (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the building where they worshiped God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the temple where God was present</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Whatever option you choose, you should communicate that Belshazzar’s order was irreverent and showed disrespect for sacred things.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:3b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The repetition of the information about the gold goblets from 5:2 emphasizes the importance of the sacred goblets.

On the 15th day of that month, they attacked the town of Sippar and King Nabonidus fled. The next day Cyrus’ army entered the city of Babylon without any battle and killed its ruler, Belshazzar.

English versions have translated it in different ways. For example, it can refer to something that is:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>in front of something else. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>opposite the lampstand (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>near something else.

This is uncertain. A good option is to translate the implied meaning of this expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>where the light from the lamps was shining most brightly (GNT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GeCL97 has : « it was exactly in the place where the light of the lamp fell. »</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>where people could see it very clearly<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em>.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the lamplight</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the lampstand:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret the definite article <em>the</em> in this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The definite article may refer to a particular lampstand.

It included a throne room where the king met special visitors. There was a large courtyard in front of the throne and a special hall for banquets.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Palaces were very big and had beautiful, expensive furnishings and decorations. If people in your region are not familiar with palaces, you may be able to use a word or phrase that describes the residence of an important person. See the Notes at 1:4c.</p><h4>5:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As the king watched the hand that was writing,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The king watched it writing.</p></li><li><p>The king observed carefully while the hand wrote <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the letters</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As:</strong> The Aramaic text connects 5:5d to 5:5a–c with the common conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>As</em> and the RSV translates as “and.” Here it introduces what happened at the same time as the hand wrote on the wall. You should connect this verse part to the previous verse part in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the king watched the hand that was writing:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>watched</em> indicates continuous action. The king could see the hand all the time it was writing on the wall. The focus here is on the king, but he was probably not alone in what he could see. Avoid implying that he was the only one who could see the hand. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king watched as the hand wrote (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king could see it writing (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king himself saw the hand as it wrote (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the hand:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates <em>the hand</em> is literally “the palm of the hand.” However, anyone watching could not see the palm of the hand while the hand was writing. So most English translations interpret this as referring to the hand as opposed to the lower arm. The point seems to be that the hand was not attached to an arm.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lucas (p. 120) explains that the expression <em>pas yeḏah</em> “denotes the hand itself, as distinct from simple <em>yeḏah</em>, which denotes the lower arm and the hand.” He adds “that the word <em>pas</em> usually refers to the palm, but ‘palm of the hand’ would not make good sense here. The implication here seems to be that it was <em>only</em> the hand that was seen, with no arm visible.” See also Goldingay, p. 101, note 5b.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that was writing:</strong> The Aramaic verb form that the BSB translates as <em>was writing</em> refers to continuous action. Use a verb form in your language that describes continuous action in the past. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as it was writing</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:5a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in 5:5a–d.

The king watched it as it wrote on the plaster wall of his palace.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a-d</sup>Just at that time, the king saw a hand.

The BSB does not explicitly translate it. You should introduce what happened in response to the appearance of the hand in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his face grew pale:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>his face grew pale</em> is more literally “his brightness changed.” See the Notes at 2:31; 4:36b. Here it refers to the king’s face. You should use an expression that describes the way a person’s face changes when they receive a sudden shock and become afraid. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the king’s face changed color.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His face turned white (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Languages may describe this change in different ways. It may be necessary to indicate why the king’s face changed color. See the General Comment on 5:6a–b for ways to do this by reversing or combining the information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and his thoughts so alarmed him that:</strong> The Aramaic text that the BSB translates as <em>his thoughts so alarmed him</em> is more literally “his thoughts alarmed him.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Belshazzar was very frightened (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his thoughts terrified him (NRSV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:6a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 5:6a–b.

So this probably indicates that the king lost strength and could no longer stand up. The expression implies that the king was very afraid. There are different ways to translate this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his legs gave way beneath him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his legs became weak (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the strength went from his legs (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>5:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and his knees knocked together.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and his knees began to knock together.</p></li><li><p>and his knees began to shake/tremble.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and his knees knocked together:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>his knees knocked together</em> indicates that the king’s legs were shaking from fear. His legs trembled and so his knees kept bumping or “knocking” together. This action symbolized that the king was very afraid. Translate this so that this is clear. Other ways to say this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His knees knocked together in fear (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his knees began to shake (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His knees trembled</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, this action may not be natural and may not clearly imply that the king was afraid.

He probably ordered his servants to tell these advisers to come to him in the palace. In some languages it may be natural to indicate that the king did not speak to the advisers in person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king shouted for the enchanters, astrologers, and fortune-tellers <u>to be brought</u> before him.

They were also skilled at solving mysteries. You should try to use the same word that you used in 2:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>diviners:</strong> The meaning of the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>diviners</em> is uncertain.

Another way to say this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he declared</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king proclaimed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to these wise men of Babylon:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>these wise men of Babylon</em> is more literally “the wise men of Babylon.” In this context it refers back to all the experts whom the king had summoned in 5:7a. Refer back to this group of men in a way that is natural in your language. See the General Comment on 5:7a–b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word that the BSB translates as <em>wise men</em> here refers to royal advisers, experts who worked for the king.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Aramaic word is <em>ḥaḵim</em>.

You may wish to indicate in 5:7a that the various experts were members of the group called “the wise men of Babylon,” Then in 5:7b you may be able to refer to them using a pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup>The king summoned the wise men of Babylon—the enchanters, astrologers, and diviners. <sup>7b</sup>When they came in, he said to them….</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Whoever reads this inscription and tells me its interpretation</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“If any of you can read this writing and tell me what it means,</p></li><li><p>“<span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will reward</span> anyone who is able to read these words and interpret/explain their meaning.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Whoever reads this inscription:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>Whoever reads this inscription</em> implies that most people present, including the king himself, could not read the writing.

The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>will be clothed</em> is passive in form. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will be able to wear purple clothes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I/They will give him purple clothes/robes to wear</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>purple:</strong> In the Ancient Near East purple clothes were very expensive.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>These clothes were expensive because the purple color was obtained from the mollusks that lived in the eastern Mediterranean sea. It took approximately 8000 mollusks to produce one gram of purple dye.</span></span> Usually only kings and queens wore clothes that were purple. Check that your reader understand that wearing purple clothes was a sign of high status. In some languages it may be natural to supply this implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>purple robes of royal honor (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>robes of royal purple (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>purple clothes fit for a king (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and have a gold chain placed around his neck,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will place a gold chain around his neck/shoulders.</p></li><li><p>and a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">great</span> necklace made from gold.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and have a gold chain placed around his neck:</strong> This phrase tells the second reward the king promised to give to the person who interpreted the message. The Aramaic text does not include a verb and more literally says “and a necklace of gold on his neck.” The BSB has supplied the passive verb “have…placed.” If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will receive a golden necklace/chain for his neck</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will give him a gold chain to wear around his neck.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gold chain:</strong> A <em>chain</em> made from gold was very expensive. The king would give a gold chain if he wanted to honor someone in a special way. In some languages, a literal translation of <em>chain</em> might suggest imprisonment or punishment. In those languages it may be necessary to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>use a word for an ornamental chain. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>necklace (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>collar (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>include the implied information that the <em>gold chain</em> was for beauty and honor.

In some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>placed on his shoulders</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will wear across his shoulders</p></blockquote><h4>5:7f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And I will make him the third highest/ranking ruler in the kingdom.</p></li><li><p>He will be appointed as the third most powerful ruler in the kingdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom:</strong> This clause describes the third reward that the king promised to whoever interpreted the message: the king would make him third in rank in the kingdom. This is a passive clause. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will appoint him as the third highest ruler in the kingdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>third highest ruler:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret this expression. It can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>He would be the third highest ruler. The highest ruler was the king, the second highest was either his son or the queen mother, and this man would be the third in rank. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the third in power in the kingdom (GNT) <em>(BSB, NRSV, NIV, GNT, CEV, NCV, GW, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>He would be one of three rulers.

It probably refers to the entrance of the various wise men into the very room where the lamp was shining and the words were visible. Perhaps the king had got up from the banquet hall and gone outside the room to wait for and speak to the wise men in the previous verse. Now they entered the dining hall to see what the writing was. There is implied information here: after entering, the wise men looked at the writing on the wall. In some languages it may be natural to imply this by indicating that the wise men approached the writing.

In this context, the two ideas are close in meaning. In some languages, it may not be necessary to translate the connection in an explicit way. The idea may be implied from the context. Here are some ways to indicate this connection:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The queen mother heard the noise made by the king and his noblemen and entered the banquet hall (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the king’s mother, who had heard the voices of the king and his royal guests, came into the banquet room.

In Aramaic the word that the BSB translates as <em>the queen</em> is the first word in the sentence. The NIV follows the Aramaic order to show this emphasis:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The queen, hearing the voices of the king and his noble (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to add this emphasis in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The queen <u>herself</u> heard the king and his nobles speaking</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Hearing the outcry of the king and his nobles:</strong> The BSB has supplied the word <em>Hearing</em>. The Aramaic is more literally “<u>because of</u> the voices of the king and nobles,” as in the NASB. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>outcry</em> is a general one meaning “words, things, matters.” In this context it implies that the men were talking loudly. The queen could probably hear enough of their words to understand what was happening. And she could hear that they were alarmed and worried. It is good to translate in a way that implies this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hearing their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">raised</span> voices</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the outcry of the king and his nobles:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>outcry</em> has a broad meaning of “words, matters, things.” In this context it refers to the loud discussion that the king and his lords were having. The queen could hear them talking and even shouting. She could hear the panic in their voices, and enough of the subject to understand what was happening. English translations express different parts of this meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the discussion of the king and his lords (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the noise made by the king and his noblemen (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the king and his officials talking (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to use an expression that indicates or implies both that the queen could hear the subject matter, and that the voices were loud. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hearing the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">loud</span> discussion of the king and his nobles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When she heard the king and his nobles talking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like this</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Hearing their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">loud</span> voices</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the queen:</strong> The text does not identify who this person was. Scholars suggest that she was either Belshazzar’s mother<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>According to Heroditus, the mother of Belshazzar was Nitocris the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar.</span></span> or Nabonidus’ mother, that is, Belshazzar’s grandmother.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Josephus. The mother of Nabonidus was named Adda-guppi. She was born in 650 and lived to the age of 104.</span></span> The title could refer to Belshazzar’s wife, but 1:2 says that Belshazzar’s wives were already present at the banquet. If you have a general title for a queen, it is good to use that here. But if you must be more specific, it is recommended that you use a title that refers to the mother of the queen. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the queen mother (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to include a footnote saying that the text literally has “queen.” If you choose to translate with a general word for “queen,” you should include a note that says that this title here probably referred to the mother of the king. The mother of the king at this time was probably Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and wife of Nabonidus.</p><h4>5:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>entered the banquet hall.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so she came into the banquet hall.</p></li><li><p>the queen mother entered the room where <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king and his nobles/officials</span> were eating/feasting.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>entered the banquet hall:</strong> The queen entered the large room where the king and his guests were eating and drinking. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the queen entered the banqueting hall (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>came into the banquet room (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“O king, may you live forever!” she said.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>She said, “King Belshazzar, may you live for ever!</p></li><li><p>She addressed the king with respect, “Your Majesty, I wish you good health!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“O king, may you live forever!” she said:</strong> The Aramaic text says “the queen said.” The Aramaic language often repeats a person’s name or title when it first introduces them in a story. In some languages it may be more natural to follow the BSB and use a pronoun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O king, may you live forever!:</strong> This was a common way people greeted the king. It is a figure of speech. It indicates that the speaker respected the king and wished him a long and healthy life. See 2:4b. Use a greeting that is natural in your language and expresses this same meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Long live the king!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Aramaic this is a second-person command addressed to the king. Some English versions follow this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>O king, live forever! (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your Majesty, may you live forever (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a form that is natural in your language for showing respect and honor to someone in authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>said:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to identify to whom the queen was speaking. She was speaking to Belshazzar the king, who was probably her son. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She said to Belshazzar (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Do not let your thoughts terrify you, or your face grow pale.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not be afraid. There is no need to look so white/frightened!</p></li><li><p>You do not have to look so pale and frightened! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Cheer up!</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not let your thoughts terrify you:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>Do not let your thoughts terrify you</em> is literally “Do not let your thoughts alarm you.” See the Notes at 5:6a, where the same verb phrase occurs. The queen was telling the king not to panic or be afraid. She was implying that everything would be all right. In translating this, remember that the queen was probably the mother of the king. Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t be…afraid about this (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Please do not be so disturbed (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no need to panic.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a positive expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Relax.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Calm down.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or your face grow pale:</strong> See the Notes at 5:6a. Here the text is more literally “Do not let your brightness be changed.” The queen told the king that he need or should not look so frightened. She implied that it was not necessary because there was nothing to be afraid of. Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and don’t turn pale (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Please do not…look so pale</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no need to turn so white!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may seem very strange to command someone not to change color. If that is true in your language, you may have to translate in a more general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Please do not look so frightened.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>There is no need to be so afraid/upset.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Cheer up!</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:10d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine the two commands into one clause. Put the two ideas in the order that is most natural in your language and makes the meaning clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Please do not panic and turn pale.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You do not have to turn white with fear!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should/need not let yourself look so alarmed/upset.</p></blockquote></div>",

She knew someone who could solve the problem. In the Aramaic text, as in the BSB, this connection is left implicit. But in some languages it may be natural to introduce this clause with a word or phrase meaning “for” or “because.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For</span> in your kingdom there lives a man who…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There is a man in your kingdom:</strong> In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of the words in this clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is in your kingdom a man (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In your kingdom there is a man (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For living in your kingdom is a man</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in your kingdom:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>kingdom</em> in this context refers to the territory that the king ruled. This man lived in the land of Babylonia.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who has the spirit of the holy gods in him:</strong> The word <em>gods</em> is plural. The Babylonians believed in many gods. See the Notes at 4:8c. The queen believed that Daniel had received special wisdom from the gods. There are different ways to translate this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the spirit of the holy gods lives in him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to whom the holy gods have given their spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the holy/sacred gods have given him their power/wisdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spirit:</strong> See the Notes at 4:8c. This expression here probably refers to wisdom or power/ability. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>special powers (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the holy gods:</strong> See the Notes at 4:8c. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>holy</em> here describes the gods as completely different and separate from people. They belong to the supernatural realm. Here are some ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gods, who are completely separate/different from human beings (TH)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gods, who live above/afar</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gods on high</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>gods:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>gods</em> is plural. It refers to more than one god. The queen, like the other Babylonians, believed in many gods.</p><h4>5:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In the days of your father</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the time/days when your father/grandfather <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Nebuchadnezzar</span> ruled,</p></li><li><p>When your predecessor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">King Nebuchadnezzar</span> was king,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the days of your father:</strong> This is a general expression that refers back to the time when Nebuchadnezzar was king. This was several decades before. You can translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When your father was king (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the time of King Nebuchadnezzar</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When Nebuchadnezzar was reigning/ruling</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your father:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>father</em> can refer to a father, grandfather, male ancestor or even to a predecessor. In this context it is clear that the queen was referring to Nebuchadnezzar. However, Nebuchadnezzar was not Belshazzar’s father. He may have been his grandfather. That is, he may have been the father of the queen mother herself. See the notes on 5:10a. Here are some ways you may translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>You may refer to Nebuchadnezzar by name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>During Nebuchadnezzar’s reign (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When Nebuchadnezzar, was king</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You may use an expression for a predecessor, that is, someone who was king at some time before Belshazzar. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You may refer to <em>your father</em> if this word can have a more general meaning of “ancestor” or “predecessor.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your father (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, it is natural to refer to the name of the person, the first time they are mentioned in a story. But either of the other options is also possible.</p><h4>5:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he/we<sup>(excl)</sup></span> realized that this man had insight and understanding.

He was as wise as the gods themselves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods:</strong> This is a passive clause. It indicates that King Nebuchadnezzar (and others in power at that time, perhaps including the queen herself) realized that Daniel was a very wise man. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. The subject may be either Daniel himself, as in the BSB, or his gifts/abilities. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was known for a perception, intelligence and wisdom comparable to that of the gods (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. Various subjects are possible. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king</span> found/saw that he had insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the gods</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span> <sup>(excl)</sup> realized/discovered that he was sensible, intelligent and as wise as the gods themselves</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this man showed good sense, knowledge, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this in a way that is natural in your language. Here are some other possibilities:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This Daniel…was found to have knowledge, judgment, and an extraordinary spirit. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This man showed himself to have insight and understanding. He was wise like the gods.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this man was known to be as smart, intelligent, and wise as the gods themselves (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>insight:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>insight</em> is related to the word meaning “light.” Here it used figuratively to refer to the ability to understand the true meaning/significance of things.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT (1927) gives the definition “illumination of the mind.”</span></span> Other ways English versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good sense (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>understanding (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>perception (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to include some implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>insight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">into problems</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>intelligence:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>intelligence</em> is similar in meaning to the previous word. The <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em> explains that this word describes the “intelligence that enables a person to avoid errors or miscalculations.” English versions translate this expression in different ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good judgment (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>knowledge (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>understanding (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to supply an implied object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and understood <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mysteries</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wisdom like that of the gods:</strong> The Aramaic text compares the <em>wisdom</em> of Daniel to <em>wisdom like that of the gods</em>. Daniel’s wisdom was godlike, divine in quality or source. In some languages it may be natural to compare Daniel himself directly to the gods. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as though he himself were a god (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wise as the gods themselves (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>wisdom</em> is a close synonym of the previous two words. It refers to the practical ability to think, speak, and act in a good and sensible way. See the Notes at 2:20b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The same word is used in 2:20c, 23, 30; 5:11, 14; Ezra 7:25. The corresponding Hebrew word is found in Daniel 1:4b, 7.</span></span> In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>and he was able to make wise decisions</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the gods:</strong> The Babylonians, including the speaker, the queen, believed in and worshiped many gods. See the Notes at 5:4.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:11c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract terms “insight,” “intelligence,” and “wisdom” as adjectives or verb phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When your father Nebuchadnezzar was king, this man was known to be as smart, intelligent and wise as the gods themselves (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When King Nebuchadnezzar was ruling Babylon, this man showed that he could solve difficult problems. He could understand mysteries that others could not understand. He was able to make wise decisions.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages there may be two words or phrases that have the same meaning as the three Aramaic words. If that is true in your language, use those two words or phrases here.</p></div><h4>5:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners.

Indicate this in a way that is natural in your language. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So that (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar:</strong> See the Note at 5:11b. Translate here in a way that is similar to what you did there. The reader should understand that the same man is referred to here and in 5:11b. You may choose not to translate the phrase <em>Your father</em> explicitly if you have already translated this in 5:11b. Refer back to Nebuchadnezzar in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>appointed him chief of:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>appointed him chief</em> here indicates that Nebuchadnezzar gave Daniel the position of <u>head</u> or <u>leading</u> adviser. He put Daniel in charge of the other expert advisers. See the Notes at 2:48c. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made him head of (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>made master of (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>put this man in charge of (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners:</strong> See the Notes and Display at 2:2a for a similar list. This list of experts probably consists of examples of various kinds of experts in the occult. In some languages you may have only one or two terms that refer to people who do these things. If that is true in your language, you may be able to begin the list with a general term like “chief of all the experts, such as….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>magicians:</strong> See the Notes at 2:2a. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>magicians</em> is a term for people who use occult means to determine the future or to learn secrets. Most English versions translate it as <em>magicians</em>. However, in this context the word “magician” does not have the modern meaning of someone who performs illusions or who does tricks. Translate this term in the same way you did at 2:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>enchanters:</strong> See the Notes at 2:2a; 5:7a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See also 2:10c, 27b; 4:4; 5:11, 15.</span></span> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>enchanters</em> describes people who performed rituals in order to influence a person’s future. For example, sometimes they would try to cast a spell on someone by using a charm or magic. They also interpreted omens. You should use the same word you used in 5:7a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>astrologers:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB transliterates as <em>astrologers</em> is literally “Chaldeans.” It can have various meanings, depending on the context in which it is used. See for example the Notes at 1:4d. Here it refers to people who were experts in the occult and magical rites. They were also people who were skilled at solving mysteries. Use the same word that you used in 2:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and diviners:</strong> See the Notes at 2:27; 4:7a; 5:7a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The term <em>gzr</em> occurs in 2:27; 4:7a; 5:7,11. HALOT (1844) says that it can have the more general meaning “seer” or alternately “soothsayer,” “fortune teller.”</span></span> The meaning of the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>diviners</em> is uncertain. It may refer to people who used occult means to determine what would happen to someone in the future. Translate it in the same way you did at 5:7a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example:diviners (NJPS, NRSV, REB)-or-fortune tellers (GW, NLT)</span></span></p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:11d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a textual problem at the end of this verse. The Aramaic text repeats the phrase “your father the king.” English versions differ as to whether they include this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Some English versions do include the phrase (BSB, KJV, NLT, NIV84, NASB, ESV)</p></li><li><p>Most English versions do not include this phrase (RSV/NRSV, GW, REB, GNT, NCV, CEV, NJPS, NJB, NET, NIV11)</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">The phrase is probably original.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See HOTTP.</span></span> The repetition of the information adds emphasis to the fact that it was King Nebuchadnezzar who appointed Daniel to a high position. The BSB translates this repeated Aramaic phrase as “Your own father, the king.” Here are some other ways to translate this verse part with the repetition included:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and King Nebuchadnezzar your father—your father the king—made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astronomers (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And King Nebuchadnezzar your father, your father the king, appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and diviners (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and your father the king put him in charge of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this was by the order of</span> your father the king.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If this type of repetition is not natural in your language, you may omit it. However, try to express the same emphasis in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he was appointed chief of all…. by Nebuchadnezzar himself—yes, by your father the king!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and your great ancestor/predecessor made him head over all….

Daniel 5 describes what Belshazzar was doing on the last day of the Babylonian empire.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027005010\" data-endVerseId=\"1027005012\"><h3>Paragraph 5:10–12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The queen now entered the banquet hall and addressed the king.</p></div><h4>5:12a–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>did this because Daniel … was found to have an extraordinary spirit:</strong> There are two main ways to understand the function of the Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>because</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces the reason for the command to send for Daniel (5:12d).

The queen urged the king to summon Daniel because of Daniel’s many excellent qualities and abilities. The NJB is therefore used in the following notes on 5:12 and as the source line in the Display.</p><h4>5:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>did this because Daniel, the one he named Belteshazzar,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This man, Daniel, was given by the king the name Belteshazzar.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The name of this man was</span> Daniel, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but</span> the king gave him the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new/Babylonian</span> name “Belteshazzar.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) Since this man Daniel, whom the king had renamed Belteshazzar:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the NJB translates as <em>Since</em> here introduces the reason for a command that the queen was about to give. She began to explain why she wanted the king to send for Daniel. See the General Comment on 5:12 for another way to show this logical connection.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NJB) Daniel, whom the king had renamed Belteshazzar:</strong> See the Notes at 1:7b. Many years before King Nebuchadnezzar had given Daniel the Babylonian name Belteshazzar. English versions have translated this clause in different ways. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The king gave him the name Belteshazzar</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom the king named Belteshazzar (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause repeats information that was given in previous chapters. In some languages it may be more natural to present this information in a different way. For example, you may:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate this clause as a parenthesis within 5:12b.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This Daniel (whom the king renamed Belteshazzar)… (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate this clause at the beginning of the verse (5:12a).</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The King changed the man’s named from Daniel to Belteshazzar.

He was skilled/good</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) is filled with:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the NJB translates as <em>is filled with</em> is more literally “was found in him.” This is a passive verb. See 5:11c, where the same verb is used. Here are some other ways to translate it in this context:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>was found to have</u> an extraordinary spirit, as well as knowledge, understanding (BSB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. It may be necessary to use the present tense (“is” or “has”) rather than the past tense (“was found to have”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This man Daniel <u>is</u> extremely intelligent. He also <u>has/possesses</u> unusual ability and wisdom.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) such a marvellous spirit:</strong> In this context, the Aramaic phrase that the NJB translates as <em>a marvellous spirit</em> refers to great or unusual human intelligence. The English word <em>such</em> has been supplied by the NJB to create a natural style. It does not represent a specific word in the Aramaic. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a keen mind (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a sharp mind (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>very smart (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NJB) marvellous:</strong> The Aramaic word that the NJB translates as <em>marvellous</em> means “excellent, extraordinary.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) such knowledge:</strong> The Aramaic word that the NJB translates as <em>knowledge</em> also occurs in 2:21e and 4:34–36. It refers to the ability to discern things. Most English versions translate this as <em>knowledge</em>. In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea using a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he knows many things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he is able to discern things</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) intelligence:</strong> The Aramaic word that the NJB translates as <em>intelligence</em> also occurs in 5:11b. Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>understanding (BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>insight (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea using a verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He understands how…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he is skilled…</p></blockquote><h4>5:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems.</p></li><li><p>at interpreting dreams, explaining riddles, and solving <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all kinds of</span> problems.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) in interpreting dreams:</strong> Daniel was able to explain the meaning or symbolism of peoples’ dreams. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the ability to interpret dreams (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He can interpret dreams (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he can explain dreams (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) solving enigmas:</strong> Daniel also had the ability to explain the meaning of things that were hard to understand. The Aramaic word that the NJB translates as <em>solving</em> is a synonym to “interpret” and means “making known.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1871.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>solve riddles (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>explain riddles (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>(NJB) enigmas:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the NJB translates as <em>enigmas</em> literally means “things that have been closed up tightly.” In this context, it has the sense of a “puzzle” or “riddle.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1809.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>secrets (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>riddles (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) and unravelling difficult problems:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the NJB translates as <em>unravelling difficult problems</em> literally means “loosening of knots.” In this context, it is a figure of speech that means “solving difficulties.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 2003. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as “solve” is a pael participle <em>mišraʾ</em> . It literally means to “untie, loosen.” Here it means to “solve.” The Aramaic word that the BSB translates “difficult problems” is <em>qeṭar</em>. It means, “joint” or “knot.” Here it has the figuratively meaning, “difficulties.” See HALOT, 1069. The author may have used this phrase in a humorous or ironic way. In 5:6 the king was so alarmed that the “knots” of his hips were loosened. In 5:12 the king said that he had heard that Daniel could “loosen knots.” In some languages you may be able to translate this irony by translating the two phrases literally.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>untangle problems (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>solving difficult problems (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>explaining mysteries (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The author may have intentionally used this phrase in a humorous way, as a joke or pun. In 5:6 the king was so alarmed that the “knots” of his hips were “loosened.” Here the queen says that she has heard that Daniel can “loosen knots.” In some languages, you may be able to translate literally and maintain the pun. If that is unnatural, translate the meaning in a more direct way.</p><h4>5:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Summon Daniel, therefore, and he will give you the interpretation.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> tell Daniel to come to you and he will tell you what the writing means.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> you should send your servants to bring Daniel here and he will explain/interpret the meaning of the words/letters <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the wall</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Aramaic text connects this verse part to the previous verse part with an adverb that the RSV translates as “Now.” This connector here introduces the conclusion of the queen’s speech, her advice to Belshazzar. Here are some other ways to introduce the queen’s concluding advice:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) send for him:</strong> The queen encouraged the king to call for or send for Daniel. The king was not going to call or summon Daniel himself. So in some languages it may be natural to indicate this by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Send <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your servants</span> to get Daniel…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Tell them (indefinite) to bring Daniel here</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is more natural and polite in your language to use a passive verb, you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let Daniel be summoned</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(NJB) he will be able to tell you what this means:</strong> The Aramaic text is literally “and he will declare the interpretation.” In some languages it may be natural to indicate what Daniel was to interpret, that is, what the word <em>this</em> represents. For example::</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he will tell you what the writing means (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will tell you what the writing on the wall means (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:12d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in 5:12d and translate the queen’s advice at the end of her speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12d</sup>He will be able to tell you what the writing means. You should send for him.</p></blockquote></div>",

From other historic sources we know that Cyrus, the king of Persia, attacked the Babylonian army during the 7th month of the year 539 B.C. On the 15th day of that month, they attacked the town of Sippar and King Nabonidus fled. The next day Cyrus’ army entered the city of Babylon without any battle and killed its ruler, Belshazzar.

When he arrived,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> and the RSV as “Then” here introduces a new stage in the action. The king did summon Daniel, and he arrived. Introduce this next event in the story in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages it may be natural to supply the implied information that the king did as the queen suggested. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is what the king did.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king summoned Daniel</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel was brought before the king:</strong> Daniel entered the king’s presence. In the Aramaic text, as in the BSB this is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to use an active verb and supply a subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they brought Daniel to the king (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king’s servants</span> brought Daniel to the king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">a messenger</span> ordered Daniel to come to the king, and he came</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before the king:</strong> This expression describes a situation where a person of lower status comes to a person of higher status or authority. Some English versions have:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>into the king’s presence (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>into the royal presence (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>5:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who asked him, “Are you Daniel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then the king said to Daniel, “So are you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that/the</span> Daniel</p></li><li><p>the king declared, “So you are Daniel, are you?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who asked him:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>asked</em> is literally “answering and saying.” This expression implies that the king was about to say something new or important. Try to show this in a way that is natural in your language. For example, you may be able to communicate the same idea with one verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king declared to Daniel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king addressed Daniel (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate the quotation that follows as a question, it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king asked him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Are you Daniel…?:</strong> Scholars have punctuated this clause in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a question. The king was asking Daniel for confirmation of his identity. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is your name Daniel….? (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, GW, NLT, GNT, NCV, KJV, NASB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>as a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So you are Daniel (NRSV) <em>(RSV/NRSV, CEV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The function of this speech is to confirm and emphasize Daniel’s identity. The king already expected to see Daniel and had received information about him. Consider how it is natural in your language for a person of authority, such as a judge, to receive confirmation of the identity of an inferior. Translate this using the form that is most natural in your language, either as a statement or as a question, real or rhetorical. The king was expressing surprise, curiosity, and perhaps even disdain.</p><h4>5:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who is one of the Jewish exiles whom my father King <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Nebuchadnezzar</span> brought <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as captives</span> from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of</span> Judah?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have heard that</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you are</span> one of those men whom my royal predecessor caused/forced to come here from their own <span data-bnType=\"implied\">country,</span> Judah.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah:</strong> The Aramaic text is more literally “one of the sons of the exile <u>of Judah</u> whom my father the king brought <u>from Judah</u>.” The BSB and several other modern translations have chosen not to repeat the place name <em>Judah</em>. The king probably repeated this name to emphasize Daniel’s low status. The king wanted to make Daniel seem foreign, unimportant. Try to reflect this emphasis in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>one of those Jewish exiles/deportees whom my father the king brought into the country</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one of the exiles:</strong> An “exile” is a person whom others have forced to leave his country. The Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar had taken many young Jewish men away from their homeland. See 1:1–5. Daniel was among these young men. The Babylonian soldiers had brought him to Babylon to serve the Babylonian empire and king. See the Notes at 2:25b. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of the Jewish exiles (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of those men whom our<sup>(excl)</sup> army captured</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of the captives (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my father the king brought from Judah:</strong> King Nebuchadnezzar’s army had conquered Judah and forced many Jewish youths to leave their homes and come to Babylonia. See the Notes at 1:3b. The king himself had not personally brought the exiles to Babylon. He had ordered his soldiers to bring them. In some languages it may be necessary to supply this implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king ordered his soldiers to bring</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom his soldiers brought back from Judah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom the king deported from Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The king deliberately focused on Daniel’s inferior status as an exile from Judah. This was in contrast to the status of King Nebuchadnezzar, whom he called his <em>father</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>my father the king:</strong> The actual relationship between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar is uncertain. It is possible that Belshazzar’s mother was Nebuchadnezzar’s daughter. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>father</em> may also mean “grandfather, ancestor, founder, predecessor.” See the Notes at 5:11b–c. Translate this here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>my predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If the word for <em>father</em> in your language can also mean “ancestor” or “predecessor” you can translate literally here. It may help to add a footnote that explains the possible meanings of “father” in Aramaic.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>from Judah:</strong> See the Notes on <em>Judah</em> in 1:1a. This name here refers to the kingdom of Judah. Judah was the homeland of Daniel and the other exiles.</p>",

See the notes there and translate in a similar way here. In some languages it may be natural to indicate how the king had heard about Daniel, that is, who had told him. It was the queen, who was probably his mother, who had told him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The queen</span> has told me that the spirit of the gods is in you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the spirit of the gods:</strong> There is a textual problem here. Scholars differ as to whether the original text said <em>the gods</em> or “the holy gods.” The two views are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The original text did not include the Aramaic word meaning “holy.” The MT does not include this word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the spirit of the gods (NJB) <em>(BSB, NASB, ESV, KJV, GW, NLT, REB, CEV, NCV, NIV, NJB, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The original text did include the word “holy” here, as well as in 5:11a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the spirit of the holy gods (RSV) <em>(RSV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), along with the MT and the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have the spirit of the gods (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the spirit of the gods lives in you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gods have given you their spirit</p></blockquote><h4>5:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that you<sup>(sing)</sup> can solve difficult problems and understand mysteries and that you are very wise.</p></li><li><p>She said/says that you<sup>(sing)</sup> are able to solve difficult problems and you can understand difficult things. She also said/says that you are able to make very wise decisions.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom:</strong> The Aramaic more literally says “and that insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom were found in you.” This is a passive clause very similar to 5:11c. See the Notes there, and translate in a similar way here. In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here, using a similar introductory phrase to that in 5:14a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have also heard</span> that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>insight:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>insight</em> is related to the word meaning “light.” In this context, it refers to the ability to understand the true meaning/significance of things. See the Notes at 5:11c. Other ways English versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>enlightenment (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>clear insight (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>perception (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to include implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>insight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">into problems</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>intelligence:</strong> See the Notes at 5:11c. The word is similar in meaning to “light.” The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>intelligence</em> refers to the ability to understand and explain difficult things. Other ways English versions translate this expression are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good judgment (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>knowledge (GNT, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>understanding (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to add an implied object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mysteries</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>extraordinary wisdom:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>extraordinary</em> is used in 5:12b-c. It means “outstanding, marvelous.” The king uses this word where the queen said “like that of the gods” (5:11c). English versions translate this phrase in different ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>marvelous wisdom (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>exceptional wisdom (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>excellent wisdom (NRSV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:14b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to translate abstract terms like “insight,” “intelligence,” and “wisdom” using adjectives or verbal clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and that you are perceptive, intelligent and extremely wise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The queen</span> also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">told me</span> that you can solve difficult problems and understand mysteries that other men cannot understand. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">She also said</span> that you are able to make very wise decisions.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted in the General Comment on 5:11, if you do not have three words similar to these, you may translate using two words or expressions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and that you are intelligent and very wise (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

Both refer to the various experts whom the king had mentioned in 5:7a.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the wise men:</strong> In some languages a literal translation of the phrase <em>the wise men</em> may imply a wrong meaning in this context. These were men who worked as advisers for the king. They were not ordinary men with special wisdom. See the note at 5:7b.

The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>to read</em> here implies the meaning “to read aloud.” The king wanted his advisers to read the writing aloud.

Historical records indicate that he married Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, and that Belshazzar was their oldest son.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the ancient Greek historian Herodotus and the Nabonidus Chronicles.</span></span> While Nabonidus was absent from Babylon during the last ten years of his reign, Belshazzar acted as king in his place.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 5 describes the last night of the Babylonian empire. From other historic sources we know that Cyrus, the king of Persia, attacked the Babylonian army during the 7th month of the year 539 B.C. On the 15th day of that month, they attacked the town of Sippar and King Nabonidus fled. The next day Cyrus’ army entered the city of Babylon without any battle and killed its ruler, Belshazzar. Daniel 5 describes what Belshazzar was doing on the last day of the Babylonian empire.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027005017\" data-endVerseId=\"1027005017\"><h3>Paragraph 5:17</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse introduces a new speaker, Daniel. Daniel declared that he could read and interpret the writing on the wall.</p></div><h4>5:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In response, Daniel said to the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then Daniel told the king, “Please just keep<sup>(sing)</sup> the/your gifts</p></li><li><p>¶ Then Daniel declared, “I do not want to accept these gifts.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In response:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>In response</em> here introduces a new stage in the narrative. Introduce this next event, Daniel’s response to the king, in a way that is natural in your language. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel said to the king:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>said</em> is literally “answering and saying.” In this context, this expression implies that Daniel was about to announce something new and important. In your translation, try to indicate that Daniel was about to say something important. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel declared</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel gave his answer to the king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the king:</strong> In Aramaic this expression is more literally “before the king” and implies that Daniel was speaking to someone who had a higher status than he did. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the presence of the king (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You may keep your gifts for yourself:</strong> Daniel spoke directly to the king. He told the king to keep his gifts. He did not want them. In some languages, people might consider it impolite to talk to a king in this way. It is good to translate this in a way that is direct but not rude. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is good/fine</span> for you to keep your gifts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I do not look for gifts from you (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Please keep those gifts for yourself.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to make it explicit that Daniel did not want the king’s gifts. You may need to supply something like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do not give those gifts to me.</span> Keep them.</p></blockquote><h4>5:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and give your rewards to someone else.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or give<sup>(sing)</sup> them to someone else.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> can give your rewards to someone else.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and give your rewards to someone else:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the function of this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It suggests an alternative to the previous clause. If the king did not want to keep the fine clothes and gold chain, he could give them to someone else. In this interpretation, the words “gifts” (5:17a) and <em>rewards</em> are synonyms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>or</u> give them to someone else (GNT) <em>(GNT, NRSV, NCV, CEV, NLT, REB, probably GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to a second action that the king should take. In this interpretation, there is a distinction between the “gifts” and the <em>rewards</em>. The king should keep the gifts but give the rewards to someone else. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and</u> give your rewards to others (NJB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NJPS, NET, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). See the Note below on <em>your rewards</em>. The NRSV is therefore used as the source line in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Daniel continued to speak plainly and directly. He made it clear that he did not want the king to pay or reward him for interpreting the writing. Some other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You can give your rewards to someone else. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I do not want them</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let someone else have/receive them.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Another man can have them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your rewards:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>rewards</em> is a rare word.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The form is odd, <em>neḇazbbeyaṯaḵ</em> which may come from <em>nebizbat beyṯaḵ</em> “the gift of your house.” Theodotion, the Vulgate, and the Syriac interpret it this way. See Goldingay, p. 102. The Aramaic word is <em>nebizbah</em>. See HALOT, 1924–25.</span></span> It is only here and in 2:6. In both places, it is used together with the word “gifts.” This suggests that they are close in meaning. Together the two words emphasize the number and quality of gifts. Several English versions use a pronoun here to make it clear that the word <em>rewards</em> is referring back to the word “gifts” in the previous verse part. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>them (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Nevertheless, I will read the inscription for the king and interpret it for him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, I will read the writing for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you<sup>(sing)</sup></span> the king, and I will tell you its meaning.</p></li><li><p>But I will read aloud the words on the wall, my king, and interpret them for you<sup>(sing)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Nevertheless:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>Nevertheless</em> in this context introduces a contrast. Daniel said he would interpret the writing <u>even though</u> he would not accept the king’s gifts. Translate in a way that most naturally shows the contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will read the inscription for the king:</strong> See the Notes at 5:7c. Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will read the writing for the king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will read the script for you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for the king:</strong> Daniel spoke to the king in the third person. This was a polite way of speaking to someone who had a high status and greater authority. This way of speaking created distance between the speaker and listener. If this kind of speech is not natural in your language, you can translate using the second person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will read this writing <u>for you</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will read this <u>to you</u>, my king.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces the second thing that Daniel said he would do. In some languages it may be natural to start a new sentence here and translate this connector as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will also</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>interpret it for him:</strong> See the Notes at 5:7c. Daniel was able and willing to explain the writing to the king. He continued to speak respectfully to the king, indicating his respect by using the third person. See the Notes above. If this kind of speech is not natural in your language, you may be able to translate using a polite second person pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tell you<sup>(plur)</sup> what it means</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:17</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>a</sup>Daniel declared to the king, <sup>c</sup>“I will read the writing and tell you what it means. <sup>a</sup>But you may keep your gifts. <sup>b</sup>Give your rewards to someone else.”</p></blockquote></div>",

Here are some possible models:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sir</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your majesty (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My lord, king (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a form that is natural in your language in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty:</strong> The Aramaic clause indicates that God had caused Nebuchadnezzar to become king of Babylonia. He gave him the right and power to rule. In some languages it may not be natural to say that a person can give an abstract idea like <em>sovereignty</em> to someone. Other ways to say this may include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Most High God gave a kingdom…to your father, Nebuchadnezzar (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Supreme God made your father Nebuchadnezzar a great king (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Most High God caused your father Nebuchadnezzar to become king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Babylon</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Most High God:</strong> See the Notes at 3:26b.

They are all positive words used to praise someone.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>greatness:</strong> See the Notes at 4:22c, 4:36f. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>greatness</em> includes the ideas of power and of importance. Try to include both ideas in your translation. In some languages it may be necessary to emphasize one or the other. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>might (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>power (REB</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>great/much authority</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> here means “dignity, honor.” See the Notes and Display at 2:37b; 4:30b.

He wrote about how King Belshazzar gave a big banquet and made use of the sacred treasures from the Jerusalem temple. Belshazzar saw a hand writing a mysterious message on the wall. Only Daniel was able to explain the message, that God was about to punish Belshazzar. That same night an army of Medes and Persians conquered the city and killed Belshazzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions give different headings to Daniel 5. These include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Handwriting on the Wall (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Writing on the Wall (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Belshazzar’s Banquet (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to write the heading in the form of a clause. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Belshazzar saw a hand write on the wall.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>King Belshazzar had/gave a banquet/feast.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions give headings to the subsections of Daniel 5. For example, the NLT has two headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Writing on the Wall (5:1)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel explains the writing (5:13)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The NRSV has three headings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Belshazzar’s Feast (5:1)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Writing on the Wall (5:5)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Writing on the Wall Interpreted (5:13)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should decide the number of headings that is best in your translation. The purpose of headings is to help readers to follow the events of the story. Headings also help the reader understand the relationships between the different parts of the story. You should try not to have more headings than necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Historical Background</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Nabonidus was the king of Babylon from 556 to 539 B.C. Historical records indicate that he married Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, and that Belshazzar was their oldest son.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the ancient Greek historian Herodotus and the Nabonidus Chronicles.</span></span> While Nabonidus was absent from Babylon during the last ten years of his reign, Belshazzar acted as king in his place.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 5 describes the last night of the Babylonian empire. From other historic sources we know that Cyrus, the king of Persia, attacked the Babylonian army during the 7th month of the year 539 B.C. On the 15th day of that month, they attacked the town of Sippar and King Nabonidus fled. The next day Cyrus’ army entered the city of Babylon without any battle and killed its ruler, Belshazzar. Daniel 5 describes what Belshazzar was doing on the last day of the Babylonian empire.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027005018\" data-endVerseId=\"1027005019\"><h3>Paragraph 5:18–19</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel summarized the lessons that King Nebuchadnezzar had learned from God in Daniel 4.</p></div><h4>5:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Because of the greatness that He bestowed on him, the people of every nation and language trembled in fear before him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He made King Nebuchadnezzar so great that people in every province and nation and language group were afraid of him.

People from every tribe and nation and who spoke every language were terrified of him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Because of the greatness that He bestowed on him:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Because of the greatness that He bestowed on him</em> indicates the cause of the following verse part. Due to, or as a result of, Nebuchadnezzar’s <em>greatness</em>, everyone feared him. Translate this logical relation in a way that is natural in your language. See the General Comment on 5:19a–b. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Because</u> God made him important (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Due to</u> the greatness that he bestowed on him (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God did such great things for him that (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the greatness that He bestowed on him:</strong> See the Notes at 5:18b. The text repeats information from 5:18b for emphasis. Languages translate repeated information in different ways. Translate this expression in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he made him so great that (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He was so great (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he caused him to become powerful</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>greatness:</strong> See the Notes at 5:18b. This abstract noun is the same Aramaic word that is also translated as “greatness” there. It is a general term that means power, importance, or high status. Here are some ways to translate it in this context:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>power (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>high position (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>such a great <span data-bnType=\"implied\">king</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the people of every nation and language trembled in fear before him:</strong> This clause expresses the result of 5:19a. One way to show this is to introduce this clause with a connector:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Therefore</u> all the nations….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>So</u> all the nations….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>so</u> great <u>that</u> people of all races and nations and languages trembled before him in fear (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this logical relation in a way that is natural in your language. See the General Comment on 5:19a–b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the people of every nation and language:</strong> The Aramaic text says “all the peoples, nations, and languages.” See the Notes at 3:4b. This is figurative language. The expression refers to people who came from every people group, who came from every nation, and who spoke every language. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People from every province and nation, and people who speak every language</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People from every tribe and nation and people who speak every language.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trembled in fear:</strong> The two Aramaic words that the BSB translates <em>trembled in fear</em> are literally “trembled and feared.” They are close synonyms and the repetition functions to emphasize the idea of fear. Other ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Trembled with fear (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shook with dread (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>were afraid of him and trembled (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to combine the two verbs into one intensive verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>were very frightened (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in fear:</strong> The people were afraid of the king because he had the power to punish them. See the Notes at 2:31.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before him:</strong> See the Notes at 5:13a. This expression describes a situation where a person of lower status comes to a person of higher status or higher authority. In this verse part the idea is already implied by the context. Many English versions do not translate it explicitly. Translate the idea of people being afraid of a powerful ruler in a way that is natural in your language.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:19a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to indicate the cause-result relationship between 5:19a–b using an expression meaning “so great that.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He made him <u>so great that</u> people of all races and nations and languages trembled before him in fear. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was <u>so great that</u> people of all nations, races, and languages were afraid of him and trembled. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of these two clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b</sup>People from every province, nation, and language trembled and were terrified by him, <sup>a</sup>because God gave him power. (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He killed whom he wished</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If he wanted to kill someone, he had him/them killed.</p></li><li><p>He put to death whomever he wished.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He killed whom he wished:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>wished</em> usually means “wish for, like.” In this context, the meaning is closer to “want” or “to choose.” Some other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those he chose</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those the king wanted to put to death (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those he wanted to kill (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This refers in a general way to anyone and everyone. In some languages it may be natural to use the singular form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If he wanted to kill <u>someone</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He killed:</strong> In this context the idea is not that the king <em>killed</em> them personally, but that he ordered his soldiers to execute them. So in some languages it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he ordered his servants/men to kill those people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he had his soldiers execute that person</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the Notes at 4:17c; 4:25f; 4:32e.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:19b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of the information in this verse part. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; (NIV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and kept alive whom he wished;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Anyone he wanted to let live, he let live.</p></li><li><p>He spared <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from death</span> whomever he wanted.</p></li><li><p>He allowed someone to live if he wanted him to live.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and kept alive whom he wished:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>kept alive</em> means “allow to live.” If Nebuchadnezzar wanted to forgive someone for even a serious crime, he forgave him. That person would not receive punishment. The soldiers would not kill/execute him. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and whom he wanted to keep alive, those people he kept alive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whomever he wished he spared alive (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom he would, he kept alive (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 5:19b, it may be natural to use a singular object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if he wanted to keep <u>someone</u> alive, he did (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If he wanted <u>someone</u> to live, he let <u>that person</u> live (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:19c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to reorder the information in 5:19c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those he wanted to spare , he spared (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whomever he wished he spared alive (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if he wanted to keep someone alive, he did (GNT)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:19b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine these verse parts into one clause. Order the ideas in the way that is natural in your language. For example, in English it is natural to put the idea of living first:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He chose whom he wanted to live and whom he wanted to die</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He could decide who lived and who died</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he exalted whom he wished</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If he wanted to promote someone, he promoted him/them.</p></li><li><p>He raised/honored whomever he wished.</p></li><li><p>he promoted whomever he wanted to promote. (GW)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he exalted whom he wished:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>exalted</em> is literally “make higher.” In this context it is used figuratively to mean “honor.” For example, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and whomever he wished he elevated (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom he would, he raised up (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 5:19b–c, it may be natural to use a singular object.

See how you translated 5:19b, c. You may wish to follow the same model here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and whomever he wished he elevated (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom he would, he raised up (ESV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:19e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and humbled whom he wished.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If he wanted to demote someone, he demoted him/them.</p></li><li><p>He disgraced/dishonored whomever he wished.</p></li><li><p>He humbled anyone he wanted to humble.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and humbled whom he wished:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>humbled</em> is literally “made low.” In this context it means “humiliated.” See the Notes at 4:37d (NJB 4:34). Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those he wanted to be less important, he made less important (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whomever he wished he humbled (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use a singular object.

In contrast to the time when the king ruled with great power (5:18–19), there came a time when God no longer allowed him to rule. Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when his heart became arrogant and his spirit was hardened with pride:</strong> Scholars have understood the Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>when</em> in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The connector introduces a temporal (time) clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when (RSV) <em>(BSB, ESV, KJV, RSV/NRSV, NIV, NJPS, GW, NLT, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The connector introduces a reason. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because his heart grew swollen with pride, and his spirit stiff with arrogance (NJB) <em>(NJB, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both aspects of the connection are true. God humbled Nebuchadnezzar <u>when</u> and <u>because</u> he became proud. If you have a way to express both ideas, that is good. If you must choose between the two options, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his heart became arrogant:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>his heart became arrogant</em> is more literally “his heart rose up.” This is an idiomatic way of saying that Nebuchadnezzar became proud or arrogant. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his heart was filled with pride</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he became proud (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>his heart:</strong> In the Aramaic language, the <em>heart</em> was the part of the body where people thought, made decisions, and felt emotions. There are different ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use an expression or idiom in your language to refer to the part of the person that thinks and feels. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his mind</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Refer to the person himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But when <u>he</u> became proud (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate this idea as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But when <u>he began to think</u> arrogantly/proudly</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and his spirit was hardened:</strong> The Aramaic text is more literally “and his spirit grew strong.” In this context, the word meaning <em>spirit</em> is a synonym for “heart.” Not only did the king become proud, but he also became strong or <em>hardened</em>. He became stubborn, obstinate, and inflexible. He determined to do whatever he wanted to do. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he refused to change his thoughts/thinking</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he became stubborn</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with pride:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>with pride</em> is more literally “to act presumptuously.” This verb occurs only here in the Old Testament. It probably describes the king as <u>behaving</u>/<u>acting</u> in an overconfident, arrogant way. His actions and behavior were in accordance with his prideful thinking. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he became…presumptuous (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that he became overconfident (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he behaved/acted in a proud/arrogant way</p></blockquote><h4>5:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he was deposed from his royal throne,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s rule/reign was brought to an end.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> removed the king from his position.</p></li><li><p>So he lost his right to rule,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">No Aramaic connector joins this clause to the previous one, and the BSB does not supply one. This clause indicates the result of 5:20a–b: Nebuchadnezzar was deposed because of his pride. Indicate this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he was deposed from his royal throne:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>he was deposed</em> means that Nebuchadnezzar was forced to give up his position as king. He was removed from his throne. That is, he could not longer sit on it to rule the country. This is a passive verb. Here are some ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was removed from his royal throne (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was taken off his royal throne (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the throne <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Babylon</span> was taken from him</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. God caused some unnamed people to force Nebuchadnezzar to stop ruling as king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God removed him from his royal position/throne.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God stopped him from ruling as king.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God caused them to remove him as king.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his royal throne:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>his royal throne</em> is literally “the throne of his kingdom.” This is a figure of speech. The royal throne was a symbol of royal power. It represented the king’s position as the ruler of the kingdom. Nebuchadnezzar was no longer allowed to rule as king over Babylon.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was…stripped of his glory (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was deprived of his glory</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb.

However, this idea is implied by the context. The phrase refers to Nebuchadnezzar’s great fame. People all over the known world had respected, honored, feared, and admired him. Now they did so no longer. In some languages it may be natural to use a verb to translate this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they did not honor him any longer</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same Aramaic word that means <em>glory</em> occurs at 2:6b, where it is translated as “honor,” 4:30b, and 5:18b.

The phrase refers to people in general. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from human society (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and his mind was like that of a beast.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He began to think <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and act</span> like a wild animal.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God caused</span> him to think <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and act</span> like an animal.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and his mind was like that of a beast:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>his mind was like that of a beast</em> is more literally “was made the same as the mind of an animal.” It indicates that God caused Nebuchadnezzar to begin thinking and acting irrationally, like an animal does. See the Notes at 4:16a–b and how you translated it there. In Aramaic this is a passive clause. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his mind was changed into an animal’s mind (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his mind was made like that of an animal (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb.

It simply means that he began to think irrationally and act as if he were an animal. Translate this expression in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his mind was like that of a beast:</strong> Here the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>like</em> indicates a comparison. Other ways to translate this to show comparison are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a mind <u>like</u> an animal’s mind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stopped thinking like a human and began thinking <u>like</u> an animal</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mind:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mind</em> is literally “heart.” In the Aramaic language, the heart was the place in the body where people thought, made decisions, and felt emotions. See the Notes at 4:16a, 5:20a, and 5:21b. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. For example</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>use the name of the body part that has this function in your language and culture:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>heart/stomach/liver</p></blockquote></li><li><p>use a verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He thought like…</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>beast:</strong> See 4:12c. The same Hebrew expression is used here. While in 4:12b this expression referred to wild animals, here it can refer to any animal. It is good to use a term that emphasizes the inferiority of animals over people as the BSB has done here.</p><h4>5:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He lived with the wild donkeys</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He made his home where wild donkeys live.</p></li><li><p>He had to live outdoors with wild animals,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He lived with the wild donkeys:</strong> The Aramaic text literally says, “his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys.” See the Notes at 4:15d, 4:25b. The king lived where wild donkeys live, far away from people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The <em>Translator’s Handbook on Daniel</em> suggests that the point of comparison is that just as the donkeys were wild and untamed, so the king acted wildly, in a uncivilized manner.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He lived where the wild donkeys lived</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He had to live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">outdoors</span> with wild donkeys.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The home/shelter of the wild donkeys became his home/shelter.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wild donkeys:</strong> In 4:25b Daniel said that Nebuchadnezzar would have to live with wild animals. Here Daniel identified one kind of those wild animals—the wild donkey, or wild ass. A donkey is an animal that resembles a horse but has longer ears and a shorter mane. People used these animals to carry heavy loads, because they were very strong.</p><h4>5:21d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:21d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and ate grass like an ox,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He ate grass like cattle do.</p></li><li><p>and he had to feed/graze on grass like an ox.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and ate grass like an ox:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>ate grass</em> is literally “they fed him with grass.” The subject is indefinite. See the Notes at 4:32c, 4:33c. In your translation, use a word for <em>grass</em> that refers to the type of food that cattle eat—wild grasses and grains—rather than lawn grass. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he had…to feed on grass like oxen (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>like an ox:</strong> The ancient farm animal known as the <em>ox</em> (plural “oxen”) had horns and was related to modern day cows. In this context, the word <em>ox</em> refers to cattle in general. See the Notes at 4:25c, 4:33c. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like cattle (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, use either the singular or the plural form, whichever is most natural in this context.</p><h4>5:21e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:21e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>His body became wet from the dew.</p></li><li><p>Dew from the sky made him wet.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>was drenched</em> means “to become wet.” The dew caused the king to become wet because he lived outside. He did not have any shelter. See the Notes at 4:15c, 4:25d, 4:33d. Here the verb describes a regular action in the past. Each morning Nebuchadnezzar became wet from the dew.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English translations begin a new sentence here. For example</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He became wet from dew (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Dew from the sky made his body wet (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the dew of heaven:</strong> See the Notes at 4:15c. <em>dew</em> refers to the moisture from the air that condenses at night and appears in the morning as little drops on plants and on the ground.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The expression occurs in Daniel 4:12, 20, 22, 30; 5:21.</span></span> If you do not have a word that means <em>dew</em>, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the water <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that appears in the morning</span></p></blockquote><h4>5:21f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:21f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He lived like this</span> until he realized/recognized that the Most High God has authority over all the kingdoms on earth.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This lasted/continued</span> until he admitted/confessed that the Most High God is ruler/king over every earthly/human kingdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the kingdom of mankind:</strong> See the Notes at 4:25f. This verse part indicates when the situation described in 5:21a–e came to an end. In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This lasted</span> until he acknowledged that the Most High God is lord over all kingdoms on earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These things happened to him until he learned his lesson: The Most High God rules over every kingdom on earth (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was forced to do this until he learned that the Most High God rules all kingdoms on earth (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>acknowledged:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>acknowledged</em> is the same verb as in 4:17c (“will know”) and 4:25f. In this context it means “accepted” or “came to know.” It refers to affirming something the king had previously denied. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he admitted (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he learned (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Most High God:</strong> The title <em>the Most High God</em> identifies the one true God as greater than all other beings that people worship. In your translation of this title, avoid implying that there exist other gods with less power. See the Notes at 3:26b and 4:2b. Translate it here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Supreme God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God Most High (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rules:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>rules</em> is more literally “is powerful, mighty” or “is lord over.” Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is sovereign (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has power over (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>controls (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the kingdom of mankind:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>the kingdom of mankind</em> is singular but because this phrase refers to all the kingdoms on earth some English translations translate this phrase in a way that indicates it includes all earthly kingdoms. See how you translated this in 4:25f. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human sovereignty (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human kingdoms (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every kingdom on earth (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:21g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:21g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>setting over it whom He wishes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He appoints whoever he wants to be their rulers.</p></li><li><p>He chooses/decides who will rule them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>setting over it whom He wishes:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>setting</em> literally means “raises” (NJB). In this context, it means “appoints” or “causes to rule.” God decides who should rule, and he makes that person the ruler. See the Notes at 4:17d–e. Other ways to translate this phrase include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>appoints over it whom he will (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>appoints anyone he desires to rule over them (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>over it:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>over it</em> refers back to all kingdoms on earth, all human rule, and every kingdom on earth. Use the pronoun that makes this clear. Or you may wish to follow the NCV and say explicitly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>over those kingdoms (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>whom He wishes:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>whom He wishes</em> means “decides, chooses.” See the Notes at 4:17e, 4:25g Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whom he will (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anyone he chooses (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:21g</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the verb phrases in this verse part.

His identity increased his responsibility and his guilt. Emphasize the king’s identity in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you, Belshazzar, who are his son, you have not humbled your heart (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you, Belshazzar, you who are king in Nebuchadnezzar’s line/place, you have not humbled yourself.</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>even though you knew all this.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even though you<sup>(sing)</sup> knew about all these events.</p></li><li><p>even though you<sup>(sing)</sup> knew <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what had happened to Nebuchadnezzar</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even though you knew all this:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>though</em> here introduces a concessive clause, a fact that makes the following statement surprising or unexpected. In spite of the fact that Belshazzar knew what had happened to Nebuchadnezzar, he was arrogant and did not honor God. Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>though you knew all this (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>although you knew all this (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in spite of knowing all this (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you knew all this:</strong> This clause tells why the king should not have acted this way. He knew the lesson that God had taught Nebuchadnezzar. The pronoun <em>this</em> refers in general to what Nebuchadnezzar had done and what had happened to him (5:18–21). In some languages it will be necessary to add this implied information.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you knew all that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">happened to Nebuchadnezzar</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you knew that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God had taught Nebuchadnezzar not to act arrogantly.</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:22a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses.

He wrote about how King Belshazzar gave a big banquet and made use of the sacred treasures from the Jerusalem temple. Belshazzar saw a hand writing a mysterious message on the wall. Only Daniel was able to explain the message, that God was about to punish Belshazzar. That same night an army of Medes and Persians conquered the city and killed Belshazzar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">English versions give different headings to Daniel 5.

The purpose of headings is to help readers to follow the events of the story. Headings also help the reader understand the relationships between the different parts of the story. You should try not to have more headings than necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Historical Background</u>:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Nabonidus was the king of Babylon from 556 to 539 B.C. Historical records indicate that he married Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, and that Belshazzar was their oldest son.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the ancient Greek historian Herodotus and the Nabonidus Chronicles.</span></span> While Nabonidus was absent from Babylon during the last ten years of his reign, Belshazzar acted as king in his place.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel 5 describes the last night of the Babylonian empire. From other historic sources we know that Cyrus, the king of Persia, attacked the Babylonian army during the 7th month of the year 539 B.C. On the 15th day of that month, they attacked the town of Sippar and King Nabonidus fled. The next day Cyrus’ army entered the city of Babylon without any battle and killed its ruler, Belshazzar. Daniel 5 describes what Belshazzar was doing on the last day of the Babylonian empire.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027005022\" data-endVerseId=\"1027005024\"><h3>Paragraph 5:22–24</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel continued speaking to King Belshazzar in 5:22, but he changed the topic.

The contrast is between what Nebuchadnezzar should have done (humbled himself, 5:22a) and what he actually did. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven! (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you have exalted yourself:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>exalted yourself</em> is literally “lifted/raised yourself.” This is an idiom that in this context means to challenge God’s authority. Here are some examples of ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have defied (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You rebelled against</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You turned against him (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord of heaven:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>Lord</em> is a title that people called an important person who had authority over them. For example, sometimes people addressed the king (4:16, 21) or God (2:47) with this title. In this context, it refers to God. Other ways modern versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord who rules in heaven</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the highest Lord<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>GeCL97.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God of heaven<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BFrCL88.</span></span></p></blockquote><h4>5:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The vessels from His house were brought to you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> gave orders to bring the vessels from God’s temple to you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to use</span>.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> commanded <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your servants</span> to bring you the sacred cups that the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jewish</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">priests</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">had used</span> in God’s temple.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The vessels from His house were brought to you:</strong> The Aramaic text is more literally “and they have brought the vessels of his house before you.” There are several ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the vessels of his house have been brought in before you (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Your servants</span> brought the vessels from God’s temple to you.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate that the king himself was the cause of the action.

See the Notes at 5:2b-c. Here are some other ways to refer to these items:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cups (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cups and bowls (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>utensils (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His house:</strong> This phrase refers to the building where the Jews worshiped and offered sacrifices to God in Jerusalem. God was present there in a special way. See the Notes on “temple” at 5:2c, 5:3a. For help on how to translate this term, see “temple” in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to you:</strong> The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>to you</em> in this context means “in front of you.” In some languages this information is implied by the context. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>here (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and as you drank wine from them with your nobles, wives, and concubines,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then you<sup>(sing)</sup> and your<sup>(sing)</sup> nobles/officials, your<sup>(sing)</sup> wives and your<sup>(sing)</sup> concubines drank wine from them,</p></li><li><p>Then you<sup>(sing)</sup> and your<sup>(sing)</sup> leading/important men/<span data-bnType=\"implied\">guests</span>, your<sup>(sing)</sup> wives and your<sup>(sing)</sup> secondary wives used them for drinking!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and as you drank wine from them with your nobles, wives, and concubines:</strong> In the Aramaic text the word <em>wine</em> is left implied. In many languages it is good to follow the BSB and supply the object <em>wine</em>. The king and his guests drank an alcoholic drink made from grapes using the sacred vessels as their cups. See 5:1b. Other ways to translate this clause include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then you and your royal guests, your wives, and your slave women drank wine from them. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You and your nobles and your wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces the next thing that happened. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions do not include an explicit connector since this idea is implied by the context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>drank:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates <em>drank</em> is a participle. Here it refers to an action that had been taking place for several hours. It may or may not have stopped by this time. Use the verb form that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have been drinking (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have drunk (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your nobles:</strong> These men were important officials and friends of the king. See the Notes on <em>nobles</em> at 5:1a and 5:2d. Translate it here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your lords (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your noblemen (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>officials (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wives:</strong> See the Notes at 5:2d. Translate here as you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and concubines:</strong> See the Notes at 5:2d.

The BSB does not explicitly translate this connector. Introduce this verse part in a way that is natural in your language. The two events (drinking the wine, 5:23c, and praising the false gods, 5:23d) happened at the same time. One way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>while</u> praising gods… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you praised your gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone:</strong> See the notes at 5:4b. The phrase <em>gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone</em> indicates that Belshazzar praised some idols that were made of silver, some other idols made of gold, others made of bronze, and so on. The people made their gods (idols) from, or out of, these materials. In order to make this clear, you may need to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You praised the gods that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">men</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">made/formed</span> from silver, from gold, from bronze, from iron, from wood, and from stone.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You praised gods made from silver, gods made from gold, and other gods made from bronze, iron, wood and/<u>or</u> stone.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you praised:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar and his guests had done this together. See 5:4a–b and the notes there. However, the Aramaic verb <em>you praised</em> is singular here. Daniel focused upon what the king had done. Try to keep this focus in your translation. If a literal translation would indicate that <u>only</u> the king had done this, it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">together with your guests,</span> you<sup>(sing)</sup> praised</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your gods:</strong> See the Notes at 2:11b; 5:4b. The Babylonians worshiped many different gods, all of them false. In some languages, the word “god” only refers to the one true God. If that is true in your language, you may have to use a different word for <em>gods</em> here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>evil spirits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the beings they worshiped</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>idols</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The NCV adds the implied information:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gods…that are not really gods (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gold:</strong> See the Notes at 5:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>silver:</strong> See the Notes at 5:2b</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bronze:</strong> See the Notes at 2:32c; 5:4b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>iron:</strong> See the Notes at 2:33a; 5:4b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wood:</strong> See the Notes at 5:4b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stone:</strong> See the Notes at 5:4b.</p><h4>5:23e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which cannot see or hear or understand.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even though these gods do not see, hear, or know anything.</p></li><li><p>These idols see nothing, hear nothing, and understand nothing!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which cannot see or hear or understand:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>which</em> refers back to the word “gods” in the previous verse part. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>these gods</u> can’t see, hear, or know anything (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>gods</u> that cannot see or hear and that do not know anything (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit that this was contrary to expectation. It was strange and useless to worship such gods. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>even though</u> they cannot see or hear or think (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cannot see or hear or understand:</strong> The Aramaic verbs that the BSB translates as <em>cannot see</em>, <em>hear</em>, and <em>understand</em> are more literally “are not seeing, hearing and knowing.” In this context the verb form expresses continuous or habitual action.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The verbs are participles.</span></span> Indicate this meaning in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which can neither see, hear nor understand (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>understand:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>understand</em> and the RSV as “know” here refers to any kind of thinking. In some languages it may be necessary to add an object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>understand <u>anything</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>know anything (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:23f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But you have failed to glorify the God</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But you<sup>(sing)</sup> did not honor God,</p></li><li><p>Yet you<sup>(sing)</sup> refused to give honor to the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But you have failed to glorify the God:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here introduces a contrast between what Belshazzar did in 5:23d–e, praise false gods, and what he should have done but did not do, honor the true God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you have failed to glorify the God:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>glorify</em> in this context means to praise and worship. The same Aramaic word occurs in 4:34 and 37. Here are some other ways to translate this expression:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have given no glory to the God (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have not given glory to God (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have not declared how great God is</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the God:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the God</em> has a definite article, <em>the</em>. Daniel focused on the unique identity of God. English versions, however, differ as to whether they use the article or not. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important that your translation does not imply that Daniel thought that there was more than one God. Translate in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> God</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:23f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be possible to indicate the contrast by emphasizing the word “God.” For example, in English the word “God” can be emphasized by placing it at the beginning of the clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God you have not honored</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:23g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who holds in His hand your very breath and all your ways.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he who gives you<sup>(sing)</sup> life and controls its course/events.</p></li><li><p>And it is he who has the power over whether you live or die. He determines/decides what will happen to you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who holds in His hand your very breath:</strong> The Aramaic words meaning <em>hand</em> and <em>breath</em> are both used figuratively. The word <em>hand</em> is used to mean “power.” The word <em>breath</em> is used to mean “life.” Consider if either of these metaphors are natural in your language. In many languages it may be natural to translate the meaning directly. Here are some ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who gives you breath (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>has power over your life (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who determines whether you live or die (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and all your ways:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>and all your ways</em> here indicates that God had power over all Belshazzar’s <em>ways</em> or paths. The word meaning <em>ways</em> is used figuratively. In this context it refers to what will happen to a person in the future. Here are some other ways to translate this idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everything that will happen to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your destiny (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the course/events of your life</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:23f–g</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to emphasize the contrast between the idols and the true God by reversing the order of 5:23f–g. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>23g</sup>But the God who has power over your life and all your ways—<sup>23f</sup>him you have failed/refused to honor.</p></blockquote></div>",

The word in the MT is pronounced “tekale,” with the first vowel short and the second long. It probably comes from a verb root meaning “weigh.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>PARSIN:</strong> This word could also have more than one meaning.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>TEKEL</em> means ‘weighed’: you have been weighed on the balances (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you have been weighed on the scales:</strong> This is a figure of speech, a metaphor. In Daniel’s time, people weighed coins, metals, or objects for sale, such as wheat. They did not weigh people. However, God said that he had <em>weighed</em> Belshazzar. This means that God had evaluated or judged Belshazzar. He did not judge him to see if he was too fat or too thin, but to test his heart and spirit. There are different ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>You can translate the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your weight has been determined/revealed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He/God has weighed you on his balance scales (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You can translate this expression as a comparison.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has evaluated you, like a merchant evaluates/weighs precious metal on his scale.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You can translate the meaning directly.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have been tested/evaluated</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this expression in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>you have been weighed:</strong> This is a passive verb. If it is more natural in your language to use an active verb, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God has weighed you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God has tested you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>on the scales:</strong> In the Middle East people used <em>scales</em> or balances to determine the weight of coins or precious metals. The balance usually had the form of a crossbeam the merchant hung from a hook or a cord. He then hung a pan from each end of the beam. He placed standard weights in one pan and the objects he wanted to weigh in the other pan.</p><h4>5:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and found deficient.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he has found/seen that you do not weigh enough.</p></li><li><p>and he has determined that you are not a good ruler.</p></li><li><p>and you have failed the test.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and found deficient:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>deficient</em> means “lacking, deficient.” This is a passive clause. Its full form is “and you have been found deficient.” God is the one who found Belshazzar <em>deficient</em>. He knew that Belshazzar was deficient or lacking in what it took to be a good ruler. If it is more natural in your language to use an active clause, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has found you wanting</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This continues the figure of speech in 5:27b. God found Belshazzar to be <em>deficient</em> in weight. That is, he was not heavy enough. This is a figure of speech. It refers to Belshazzar’s moral character, not to his physical weight. Belshazzar was insufficient or inadequate for the task of ruling. You can translate this figure of speech in several ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>You can translate the figure of speech:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and found to be too light (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have judged that you lack weight<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BFrCL88.</span></span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>You can indicate the meaning of the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and found you lacking <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in character/virtue</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and found not good enough (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and you have failed the test (similarly the NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>found deficient:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>found</em> is here used in a figurative way. In this context it means “determined, shown, judged to be.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has determined that you are inadequate</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has judged you to be insufficient</p></blockquote>",

From other historic sources we know that Cyrus, the king of Persia, attacked the Babylonian army during the 7th month of the year 539 B.C. On the 15th day of that month, they attacked the town of Sippar and King Nabonidus fled. The next day Cyrus’ army entered the city of Babylon without any battle and killed its ruler, Belshazzar. Daniel 5 describes what Belshazzar was doing on the last day of the Babylonian empire.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027005026\" data-endVerseId=\"1027005028\"><h3>Paragraph 5:26–28</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In these three verses Daniel interpreted the words on the wall. He explained what they meant.</p></div><h4>5:28a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:28a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>PERES means that your kingdom has been divided</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>‘Peres’ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means ‘division.’</span> There are divisions in your kingdom.</p></li><li><p>‘Parsin,’ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">or ‘divided,’</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means/indicates that</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will divide your kingdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>PERES:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB transliterates as <em>PERES</em> is the singular of the Aramaic word “Parsin” in 5:25b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Daniel may also have intended to make a play on the word <em>pares</em> which means Persia. The kingdom of Persia attacked and conquered Babylon that very night.</span></span> Daniel interpreted it as the verb that sounded like it, the verb that means “divided.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The verb is a perfect passive form.</span></span> It can also refer to half a shekel or half a mina.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this word in the same way as in 5:25b. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>You may transliterate the Aramaic word <em>PERES</em> or “parsin.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>parsin</em>: your kingdom has been <em>divided</em> (NJB) In the online version of the NJB, “parsin” and “divided” are not in italics. However, they may be in italics in printed versions. The words “divisions” and “Parsin/parsin” are in italics in the GNT, NLT, and CEV, cited just below. So in those cases the <em>codes are appropriate.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>You may translate the meaning of the word <em>PERES</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Divided—your kingdom will be divided (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>divisions</em>, your kingdom is divided up (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You may both transliterate and supply the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>Parsin</em> means ‘divided’ (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><em>parsin</em>, which means “divided” (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your kingdom has been divided:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>divided</em> means “break in two, divide, separate.” This was to happen that very night. God had decided this and it was certain to happen. Daniel referred to this future event as if it had already happened.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is the haphal perfect of <em>šelem</em>. HALOT (1996) suggests “to make an end of, finish, or to abandon.”</span></span> This was a special way that prophets talked when they proclaimed a message from God. Use the verb tense that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your kingdom will be divided (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your kingdom is being divided (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I declare/proclaim</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what God has decided</span>: the division of your kingdom!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>divided</em> does not mean that the Medes and the Persians would share the country with the Babylonians. It means that God would end the power of the Babylonian empire. Translate the meaning in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your kingdom is broken</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an active clause. God is the implied subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will divide your kingdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has decided to break your kingdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your kingdom:</strong> See also the Notes at 5:26b.

This was an event still to happen, in the very near future. So in some languages it may be natural to translate this using a future tense verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will be…given to the Medes and Persians (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. In some languages an active clause may be more natural. If that is true in your language, you may supply the subject “God” and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will give it to the Medes and Persians.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will allow the Medes and Persians to conquer it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Medes:</strong> The Medes were an Indo-European tribe that lived in the area that is now part of the modern country of Iran.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Persians:</strong> The Persians were a tribe that lived in the land that is now called Iran. They had previously been allies of the Babylonians. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>Persians</em> sounds like the word “PERES.” Some versions show this play on words by using italics for both words. Another option is to explain the play on words in a footnote.</p>",

These men would have authority in each local district or area. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps.

(GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Darius decided to appoint a hundred and twenty governors to hold office throughout his empire. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it pleased Darius to appoint:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>pleased</em> means “seemed good to.” In this context, the phrase implies that Darius decided to act in this way, and then he actually did so. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Darius decided it would be good to appoint (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Darius decided…and he appointed (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Darius:</strong> See the Notes at 5:31.

Here are some other ways to translate this idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to choose one hundred twenty governors (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>satraps:</strong> See the Notes at 3:2a. A “satrap” was an official who ruled over a region of the Persian empire.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Esther 1:1 mentions 127 provinces at the time of Xerxes (485–465 B.C.). From other ancient sources, there appeared to be between 20 to 29 satraps in the Persian empire at the time of Darius I (522–485 B.C.) The author may use the word “satrap” here in the wider sense of a provincial official. The term was used in 3:2 referring to the time of the Babylonian empire.</span></span> Use a term that is natural in your language for the title of such an official. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>governors (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>high officer (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to rule throughout the kingdom:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>to rule</em> is a general verb. The Aramaic phrase is more literally “who will <u>be</u> throughout the kingdom.” The satraps would live and rule spread out over the kingdom, each ruling one of the 120 provinces. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stationed throughout the whole kingdom (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to hold office throughout his empire (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who would be in charge of the entire kingdom (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>throughout the kingdom:</strong> The phrase <em>throughout the kingdom</em> here refers to the entire country that Darius ruled. See how you translated the kingdom in 5:31. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>throughout his empire (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>over his whole realm</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:1</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse implies that the 120 men ruled over 120 different parts of the kingdom.

The 120 satraps had to report to the three administrators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to indicate that the administrators were over the <em>satraps</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>administrators to supervise the high officers (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Darius put three other officials in charge of the governors (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were accountable:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>were accountable</em> means “were reporting to, were responsible to.” The satraps had to give a report of what they did and were responsible for the results. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to report to (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gave account (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>were to be responsible to (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that the king would not suffer loss:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> here introduces the purpose of the previous clause. The king’s purpose in appointing the three administrators was to protect his interests. He wanted to make sure that the satraps were honest and gave him all the taxes they collected. Here are some other ways to translate this purpose clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the king’s interests might not suffer (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the king wouldn’t be cheated (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The supervisors were to ensure that the governors did not try to cheat the king.

They also made sure that everyone paid their taxes and that no one cheated the king. See also the last clause in Ezra 4:13. Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that no one might cause the king trouble/loss</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that no one might cause difficulty for the king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that no one would cheat the king</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages it may be natural to use a positive expression.

Daniel did his work so well that the other officials became jealous of him. One day they asked the king to pass a law that forbade praying to anyone but him for a period of thirty days. The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him.

Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then (RSV/NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by his extraordinary spirit:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>by</em> here introduces a reason clause. There are at least two interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It connects to the previous clause and introduces the reason why Daniel was able to do better work than the other men. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because an excellent spirit was in him (RSV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV/NRSV, KJV, ESV, NJB, REB, NET, GW, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It connects to the following clause and introduces the reason why the king appointed Daniel.

(NLT) <em>(NLT, CEV, NCV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his extraordinary spirit:</strong> This phrase refers to Daniel’s intelligence and ability to learn and understand. See 1:17a. See the notes at 5:12b-c, where the same phrase occurs.

Translate in a way that is natural in your language. If you decide to translate the pronoun, make sure that it does not give a negative or derogatory meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps:</strong> Daniel was an excellent administrator. He was clearly superior to the other officials. Others—probably including the king—could see what good work he did. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Among all the administrators and satraps, it was Daniel who proved to be the best</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In that group of administrators and satraps, Daniel showed/displayed excellence</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel stood out among the administrators and satraps</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea as a comparison. Daniel showed himself <u>better than</u> the other officials. He did <u>better work than</u> they did. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>proved himself more capable than all the other high administrators and high officers (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>showed that he could do better work than the other supervisors or the governors (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did his work so much better than the other governors and officials (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>among the administrators and satraps:</strong> Daniel was one of the three administrators.

Daniel was one of a group of three administrators. So it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>than the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">two other</span> supervisors</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>than <span data-bnType=\"implied\">both of the other</span> high officials</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>and satraps:</strong> See the Notes at 6:1.

In spite of their efforts, the officials could not discover anything about Daniel that they could complain about to the king.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they could find no charge or corruption:</strong> See the Notes at 6:4a. Some English versions, such as the RSV and BSB, follow the Aramaic and repeat this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but they could find no ground for complaint (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But in many languages such a repetition may be unnatural. It may be more natural to translate this phrase in another way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they couldn’t find anything to criticize (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they could not find anything wrong (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but they couldn’t (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>they could find no charge or corruption</em> here indicates that it was clear to the officials that Daniel was not corrupt. He never took bribes or placed his own interests above his duties. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But they were unable to find any such damaging evidence (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They could find nothing to his discredit. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but they failed to find any malpractice on his part (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is important to <u>avoid</u> implying that the officials could not find corruption but that it was secretly present. The author was not saying that Daniel was able to hide his corrupt dealings. If a literal translation would give this wrong meaning, it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they found he had never acted corruptly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they found him to be incorruptible/honest</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>corruption:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>corruption</em> is also used in 2:9c, where the BSB translates it as “fraudulent.” It literally refers to something that is spoiled or bad. In this context it refers to accepting bribes and using public office for personal gain.</p><h4>6:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was found in him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They saw/realized that he was not corrupt.

It was because there were no faults in his behavior, public or private.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he was trustworthy:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>trustworthy</em> is also used in 2:45f.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Daniel 2:45f it is used as an adjective to describe Daniel’s interpretation. The RSV translates it “sure.” The GNT has “true.” The NJB has “exact.”</span></span> In this context, it describes Daniel as honest and dependable. Here are some other ways to translate this idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he was faithful (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel was reliable (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and no negligence or corruption was found in him:</strong> This is a passive clause. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and no error or fault was found in him (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and did not do anything wrong or dishonest (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one could accuse him of laziness or dishonesty.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was not guilty of any negligence or corruption.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Similarly, the NET.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>no negligence or corruption:</strong> The Aramaic text says “any negligence and corruption.” Use the order and grammatical form that is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>neither corrupt nor negligent (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>corruption:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>corruption</em> refers to self-serving behavior, acting for personal gain rather than the common good. See the Notes at 6:4c-d. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>corrupt (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>dishonest (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>negligence:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>negligence</em> refers to a habit of working in a careless and lazy way. A negligent person is one who does not fulfill their duties and responsibilities. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>lazy (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>irresponsible</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:4d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is more natural to translate all of 6:4d in a positive way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because he was honest and faithful and did everything he was supposed to do (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span> <sup>(excl)</sup> the royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are all agreed, presidents of the realm, magistrates, satraps, councillors and governors (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars are uncertain of the exact function of each of these officials. They are also unsure if the names are listed according to rank. The main point is that the text refers to all the important members of the administration, the government officials. In some languages you may not have so many different names for officials. In that case you may have to translate a shorter list and use more general terms for officials. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All of your officials, leaders, advisors and governors (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All of us who administer your empire—the supervisors, the governors, the lieutenant governors, and the other officials (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>royal administrators:</strong> This term refers to the high officials who supervised the satraps. Not including Daniel, there were only two of them. See the Notes at 6:2a. Translate the term here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>chief officials of the kingdom<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Nouvelle Version Segond, the BFrCL88 is similar.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>administrators (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>supervisors (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prefects:</strong> The prefects were also government officials but their specific role is uncertain. See the Notes at 3:2a. Translate the term here in the same way you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>advisors (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>magistrates (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>satraps:</strong> See the Notes at 6:1 and 6:2a. Translate the term here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>governors (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>advisers:</strong> See the Notes at 3:24b, 3:27a.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The same word is used in 3:24b, 27a, 4:36.</span></span> Translate here as you did there.

Translate here as you did there and at 3:27.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have agreed:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates <em>have agreed</em> means “have taken counsel together.” Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are in agreement</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have taken counsel and all are agreed (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are unanimous</p></blockquote><h4>6:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce a decree</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that you, the king, should make a new law that everyone must obey:</p></li><li><p>you to make a new law and enforce it strictly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that the king should establish an ordinance:</strong> The officials asked the king to make a new law. They spoke in a polite way in order to influence the king to do what they wanted. Only the king had the authority to make a law official. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that Your Majesty should issue an order (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king should make a statute (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you should make a law (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ordinance:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>ordinance</em> here refers to a law that was to be in effect for a specific period of time. Use a term that can refer to a temporary order such as this one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>decree (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>edict (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>law (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and enforce a decree:</strong> This phrase explains more about the law. The officials wanted to be able to punish those who disobeyed it. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that will be strictly enforced (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and enforce it strictly (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for everyone to obey (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>decree:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>decree</em> refers to a law that prohibits something.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1821. The word occurs in 6:8,10,13,15.</span></span> You can translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>interdict (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>ban</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prohibition</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, make sure that you do not imply that the men were talking about two laws. The term <em>decree</em> refers to the same law as the word “ordinance” in the previous clause. In some languages it may be better to use a pronoun that refers back to the law in the previous clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and enforce <u>it</u> strictly (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>6:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that for thirty days anyone who petitions any god or man</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For the next thirty days, anyone who prays to a god or man/human</p></li><li><p>For the next month, no one may pray to any god or person</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Daniel 6:7c the officials told the king what the law should say. In some languages it may be good to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The decree should state… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Give orders… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that for thirty days anyone who petitions any god or man:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>petitions</em> is literally “requests a request.” In this context, it means “prays a prayer.” There are two ways to indicate the content of the decree:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>You can state this positively:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that whoever prays to anyone (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You can state it negatively:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no one should pray to…</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The Persians used to pray both to gods and to people who represented gods, like the king. In some languages it may not be natural use the verb “pray” in this way. If that is true in your language, you may have to use a different verb for “pray” as the BSB has done. Some other ways to do this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no one may request anything</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whoever asks for anything (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for thirty days:</strong> This phrase indicates that this new law would be in force for thirty days. After that time, it would no longer apply.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>any god:</strong> See the Notes at 2:11b; 5:4, 2:23a. The Persians worshiped many different kinds of gods. In some languages, the word <em>god</em> only refers to the one true God. If that is true in your language, you may have to use a different term here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to any divine/supernatural being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to any spirit</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to anyone/anything we worship</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>man:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> here refers to people in general.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>person (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>6:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>except you, O king,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>other than to you, our king,</p></li><li><p>but only to you, the king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>except you, O king:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>except</em> introduces the one exception to the law. People could make their prayers and requests to the king. The officials intended to compliment the king by treating him like a god.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Goldingay (p. 128) notes that the Persian king was not thought of as divine in the same way as the Egyptian Pharaoh was thought of by his people. However, in the court, people showed him respect in a ceremonial way as one would show respect to a god. The king was considered as a manifestation or representative of deity as well as a mediator with deity.</span></span> Other ways you can translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>except to your Majesty (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>other than you, O king (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a positive statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They may/must pray to you alone, our king.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Only to you may they pray, O king.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. See the General Comment on 6:7c–e.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O king:</strong> Use a form that is natural in your language to show respect to an important person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sir/Sire</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Honorable one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our<sup>(excl)</sup> king</p></blockquote><h4>6:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will be thrown into the den of lions.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>is to be tossed/pushed into the den of lions.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If he disobeys,</span> he must be punished.

The king’s men would force the offender to enter the den where lions were kept. It is implied that the lions would certainly kill and eat him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>will be thrown</em> is passive. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they (indefinite) will throw him/them into the den of lions</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">your soldiers</span> will cause them to fall into the pit where lions live</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be thrown:</strong> In this context, the verb <em>be thrown</em> indicates that the men would lift the offenders up and drop them into the den. In some languages, you may have to use a different verb. Translate this idea in a way that is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be dropped</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be forced to enter</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be caused to fall</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the den of lions:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>den</em> here refers to a large room below the ground. There was probably an opening at the top where food could be dropped to the lions. The king kept lions here as a way to execute criminals. In some languages it may not be natural to translate the definite article <em>the</em> since the author has not referred to this <em>den</em> before. You can translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a pit (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a large hole</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>lions:</strong> The lion is a large and powerful animal of the cat family. It has a brownish yellow skin and a tufted tail, and the male has a shaggy mane. Lions hunt and kill other animals for food. The king punished people by throwing them into the pit where he kept lions. The lions would kill and eat the people. In some languages, people may not be familiar with lions. If that is true in your language, see KBT for different ways to translate unknown terms.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:7a–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This is a long and complex sentence. In some languages it may be natural to break it into two or more shorter sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup>All the officials, governors, satraps, advisers and mayors agree that <sup>7b</sup>the king should make a statute and enforce a decree. <sup>7c</sup>The decree should state that for the next 30 days whoever asks for anything from any god or person <sup>7d</sup>except you, Your Majesty, <sup>7e</sup>will be thrown into a lions’ den.

(CEV)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:7</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>c-e</sup>The law should state that they will throw into the lion pit anyone who prays to any god or person except you, the king, during the next thirty days,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>b-e</sup>Give orders, King Darius, that for the next thirty days this law will be in force: your soldiers will throw to the lions anyone who prays to any god or human except you.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:7c–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The content of the decree is given as indirect speech. In some languages it may be more natural to give the content directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The decree should say this: ‘Anyone who prays to any god or human being except for King Darius shall be thrown into the lions’ day. This is in force for thirty days.’</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>should issue the following decree: For thirty days no one is to pray to any god or human being apart from King Darius.

The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>changed (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, KJV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). No one was allowed to revoke, cancel, or annul the laws of the Medes and the Persians. No one, not even the king, had the authority to put an end to the authority of these laws. See also Esther 1:19a and Esther 8:8c Use the expression that is natural for bringing a law to an end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>revoked (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put an end to</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which no one can repeal/annul</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cannot be repealed:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>cannot</em> is an emphatic negative. Emphasize the impossibility of repealing the law in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in no way be repealed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use a strong positive expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>must remain in force</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are firmly established</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:8</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to combine some of the information in this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8a</sup>So let your Majesty issue and sign this law. <sup>8b,d</sup>Then it will be unchangeable and irrevocable, <sup>8c</sup>like the other laws of the Medes and Persians.</p></blockquote></div>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But when Daniel learned that the law had been signed, he went home and knelt down as usual… (NLT) <em>(NRSV, CEV, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p><h4>6:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now when Daniel learned that the document had been signed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But when Daniel heard that the king had signed the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new</span> law,</p></li><li><p>¶ Daniel heard the news/report about the law</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now when:</strong> In this context the common Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>Now when</em> introduces what happened next in the narrative. See the note above on 6:10a–b. Introduce what Daniel did in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel learned that the document had been signed:</strong> The Aramaic text does not say how <em>Daniel learned</em> that the king had signed the law. Someone probably told Daniel the news. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. It is usually best not to explain how Daniel <em>learned</em> this information. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel knew that the document had been signed (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel realized that a written decree had been issued (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel heard about the law (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the document had been signed:</strong> See the Notes at 6:8a and 6:9, where the same Aramaic phrase is used. However in some languages it may be natural to vary the wording and use a more general expression as some English versions do. The king signed the decree in order to show that he authorized and approved it, and by so doing he issued and published it. The decree was not published in the modern sense of being printed. It was written by hand and read aloud to the population. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the decree had been published (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a written decree had been issued (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB translates this as a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to translate it as an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king had issued/signed the document</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>document:</strong> See the Notes at 6:8a.</p><h4>6:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he went into his house,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he went back to his house.

There on the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">flat</span> roof there was a room</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he went into his house:</strong> Daniel entered his own house. It is implied that at the time he heard the news he was somewhere else, but we do not know where.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:10a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of the information in 6:10a, b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10b</sup>Daniel went home <sup>10a</sup>when he heard that the king had issued the new law.</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>where the windows of his upper room opened toward Jerusalem,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>there were windows that opened towards Jerusalem.</p></li><li><p>with windows that faced in the direction of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Jerusalem.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his upper room:</strong> Daniel’s house had a flat roof. On one corner of his roof there was a room. It had windows and a door. There were stairs that allowed a person to walk up to the room on the roof. In some cultures, people may not be familiar with this type of house and do not build rooms above other rooms, or on roofs. Refer to such a room in a way that is clear and natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the roof-chamber (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his upper chamber (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>room on top of a house (TH)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>opened toward Jerusalem:</strong> This phrase describes Daniel’s house. It is background information. It indicates that customarily the windows were open in the direction of the holy city of Daniel’s God. Jewish people normally prayed facing Jerusalem. And, it is implied, since the windows were open, Daniel’s enemies would be able to see him praying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>An upper room in his house had windows that opened in the direction of Jerusalem (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In an upstairs room of his house there were windows that faced toward Jerusalem (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to make explicit who <em>opened</em> the windows. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he opened the windows that faced Jerusalem</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is best if you can describe the windows as already open and not mention who opened them. See also the note below on <em>opened toward Jerusalem</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>toward Jerusalem:</strong> The windows were on the side of the building that faced west. This was in the direction facing the city of Jerusalem, which was west of Babylon.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:10a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB follows the Aramaic text and leaves as implicit the information that Daniel entered this upper room:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed <sup>10b</sup>he went into his house. <sup>10c</sup>And windows in his upper room were facing toward Jerusalem.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions, including the BSB, follow the Aramaic order and leave the same information implicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a-c</sup>When Daniel learned that the order had been signed, he went home. In an upstairs room of his house there were windows that faced toward Jerusalem. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a-c</sup>When Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went to his house. An upper room in his house had windows that opened in the direction of Jerusalem. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You may leave the information that Daniel entered the upper room implicit if that is clear and natural in your language. However, if you do this, make sure that it is clear in the next verse part that Daniel was praying in front of the open windows. The NIV, rather than leave it as implicit, supplies the information in 6:10b and indicates that Daniel went to his upstairs room:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, <sup>10b</sup>he went home to his upstairs room <sup>10c</sup>where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. (NIV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:10d-e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God:</strong> This describes a regular, habitual action. This happened each day for some time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prayed, and gave thanks to his God:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>prayed, and gave thanks to his God</em>, is more literally “and was praying and was praising.” The author used two verbs to describe what Daniel did. Daniel prayed to God and praised/thanked him. In this context, these are not two different actions but two verbs referring to the same action.</p><h4>6:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">There</span> three times each day he knelt down to pray,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In front of those windows</span> Daniel knelt and prayed every morning, noon, and evening.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and three times a day he got down on his knees:</strong> This clause leaves implicit the idea that Daniel got down on his knees in front of the windows, or where he could look toward Jerusalem. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Three times a day he knelt <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Three times a day he knelt down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before those windows</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Three times a day he knelt down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and looked toward Jerusalem</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and three times a day:</strong> Each day, Daniel knelt to pray at three different times, probably morning, noon, and night. Translate this idea in the way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Three times each/every day</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he got down on his knees:</strong> The Aramaic clause is literally “kneeling on his knees.” When Daniel prayed, he knelt down on his knees. This was the way he showed that he honored and respected God. In some cultures people may pray in a different position, such as prostrate on the floor. However, if Daniel had been lying on the floor, his enemies would not have been able to see him. So if kneeling is an unnatural position for prayer in your culture, you may wish to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he got ready to pray according to the Jewish custom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he positioned himself to pray</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he knelt down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as all the Jews did</span></p></blockquote><h4>6:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and gave thanks to his God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>praising his God</p></li><li><p>He thanked God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for all his blessings/kindness</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to his God:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to his God</em> is literally “in front of his God” or “in the presence of his God.” The phrase implies meekness before someone who was in authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to use a possessive pronoun with God (<u><em>his</em></u> <em>God</em>). If that is true in your language you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the God whom he worshiped</p></blockquote><h4>6:10f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as he had done before.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as was his regular custom.</p></li><li><p>in the same way as he had done before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king passed the law</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as he had done before:</strong> This is a comparison. Daniel acted <u>in the same way</u> as he had before. He had been in the custom of praying three times a day before his open window. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as he had always done (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as was his custom (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He had always praised God this way. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>he had done</em> describes a habitual action in the past. Use the verb tense that is appropriate in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just as he always used to do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the same way that he always did</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:10</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses, giving the background information first. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10c</sup>Daniel had an upstairs room in his house which had windows that faced Jerusalem. <sup>10d</sup>Three times a day he would kneel down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in front of those windows</span> and pray and praise God. <sup>10a</sup>When Daniel knew that the king had signed the new law, <sup>10b</sup>he went to his house and prayed there, <sup>10e</sup>just as he had always done before.</p></blockquote></div>",

The officials acted in a certain way because of what they had seen. Introduce this action in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they approached the king:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB literally translates as <em>approached</em> implies, in this context, that the subject was approaching someone of higher status and importance.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1972.</span></span> If you have a special verb that has this meaning, you can use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and asked:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>asked</em> here introduces the act of speech in a general way. In this context, it may be natural to use a more specific verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>talked to the king (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and reminded him (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>about his royal decree:</strong> The phrase <em>his royal decree</em> indicates the topic of the officials’ conversation with the king.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his royal decree:</strong> There are two ways to understand the function of the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>royal</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “of the king” and refers to the decree that the king had made. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king’s decree (KJV) <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, NASB, GW, NET note)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a form of address for the king and introduces the officials’ speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O king! (NRSV) <em>(RSV/NRSV, ESV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Aramaic text does not contain quotation marks, so it is difficult to be certain. You may wish to follow your national language version. Either option may involve some unnatural repetition. In some languages it may be natural to avoid this repetition by using a personal pronoun here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and spoke to the king about <u>his</u> decree (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>decree:</strong> See the Notes at 6:7b. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>decree</em> refers to a law that prohibits people from doing something.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Aramaic word is <em>ʾesar</em>. HALOT, 1821 has “prohibition.”</span></span> It implies that if a person disobeyed the king, he would be punished.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:12a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to supply the reason the men went to the king. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all of them went together to the king to accuse Daniel. They said… (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:12b–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Did you not sign a decree that for thirty days any man who petitions any god or man except you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It functions as a polite way to remind the king of the law that he had signed. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>have you not issued an edict that any person who, within the next thirty days, presents a petition to any god or human being other than your majesty is to be thrown into the lion-pit? (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty, you signed an order that for the next thirty days anyone who requested anything from any god or from any human being except you, would be thrown into a pit filled with lions. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the form that is most natural in your language in this context.</p><h4>6:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Did you not sign a decree that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Your Majesty, is it not true that you have signed a law that</p></li><li><p>“Your Majesty, recently you signed a ban.

In some languages it may be more natural to use direct speech. See the General Comment on 6:7. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>did you not sign this law: ‘No one may pray to any god or man other than His Majesty and anyone who disobeys is to die in the lions’ den’?</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:12b–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it will be more natural to translate this rhetorical question using two or more shorter sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Didn’t you sign a law that says no one may pray to any god or human except you, O king? Doesn’t it say that anyone who disobeys during the next thirty days will be thrown into the lion’s den?

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king answered (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king agreed (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>According to the law of the Medes and Persians:</strong> See the Notes at 6:8c.

Some English versions do not translate the connector (GW, CEV). This is acceptable, as long as the meaning is implied in the text. Introduce the next event in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they told the king:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>they told the king</em> is literally “they answered and saying before the king.” See the notes on 5:17a and 6:10d. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they responded to the king (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They replied (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>6:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, shows no regard for you, O king,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Daniel, one of the exiles/captives from Judah, is not respecting/obeying you, Your Majesty.</p></li><li><p>“Sir, the man Daniel whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your soldiers captured and</span> brought here from Judah is ignoring you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Aramaic text there is a connector introducing 6:13b. This connector is often translated as “that.” In this context there are two ways to interpret it:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It introduces direct speech. Therefore in English it does not need to be explicitly translated. <em>(BSB, GW, NRSV, ESV, REB, NET, GNT, NCV, NIV, NJPS, NASB)</em></p></li><li><p>It is a demonstrative. It refers to Daniel and may imply a negative opinion of him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that Daniel (RSV) <em>(KJV, RSV, CEV, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, shows no regard for you, O king:</strong> The men brought their accusation. They said that Daniel was not listening to or obeying the king. He was not following the king’s order. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, is not paying attention to you, O king (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your Majesty, Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, refuses to obey your order (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, does not respect Your Majesty (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one of the exiles from Judah:</strong> See the Notes at 2:25b. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of the captives from Judah (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>exiles:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>exiles</em> is literally “sons of the captivity.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>beney ḡaluṯaʾ</em> “sons of deportation, exile.” HALOT, 1845. See also 2:25, 5:13.</span></span> In some languages it may be natural to translate the idea “captivity” as an action and add implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>one of the men whom the army captured and brought here from the country of Judah</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>shows no regard for you, O king:</strong> The officials complained that Daniel was ignoring the king and his authority. See the Notes at 3:12c. In some languages it may be natural to translate this with a positive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is ignoring you (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>O king:</strong> See the Notes at 6:6b. The officials addressed the king with respect.</p><h4>6:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or for the decree that you have signed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He does not obey/follow the order/law that you have signed.</p></li><li><p>He refuses to obey the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new</span> ban/prohibition that you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just</span> approved.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or for the decree that you have signed:</strong> Daniel was failing to obey the king by failing to obey his <em>decree</em>. So the Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>or</em> here introduces an explanation of the previous clause. In some languages it may be natural to indicate this by beginning a new sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is not obeying the decree that you issued.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have used a positive verb in 6:13b, like the NLT, it may be necessary to use a connector meaning “and” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is ignoring you <u>and</u> your law (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the decree that you have signed:</strong> For the Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the decree</em> see the Notes at 6:7b. It refers to a law that prohibits or bans something. In some languages it may be necessary or natural to use a more general word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your law (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the edict (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the order you issued (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 6:8a, there are two ways to interpret the Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>you have signed</em>. Follow the same interpretation here as you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context, signing the decree showed that the king gave it his authority. He approved of it and would enforce it. If signing a law does not have this implication in your culture, you may wish to use a more general expression. For example</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the ban that you issued</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the prohibition you have approved</p></blockquote><h4>6:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He still makes his petition three times a day.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He prays three times each day.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Instead,</span> he continues to pray <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to his God</span> three times every day.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Aramaic text connects 6:13d and 6:13c with the common connector that the RSV translates as “but.” In this context it introduces a contrast. Daniel did not obey the law. <u>Instead</u>, he continued praying to his God. The BSB does not use a connector but indicates this contrast by supplying the word “still.” You should connect this verse part to the previous verse part in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He still makes his petition three times a day:</strong> See the Notes at 6:10d. The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>makes his petition</em> is literally, “requests a request.” Use an expression that is natural for referring to daily private prayers. In some languages it may be natural to indicate to whom Daniel prayed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel still prays <u>to his God</u> three times every day. (NCV)</p></blockquote>",

The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him.

Daniel did his work so well that the other officials became jealous of him. One day they asked the king to pass a law that forbade praying to anyone but him for a period of thirty days. The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him.

In this context scholars have interpreted it in different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces the next event in the narrative. The king gave the order and his men carried it out. In some languages you may be able to use a different connector.

Either interpretation is acceptable. It is important that your readers understand <u>both</u> that the king gave the order <u>and</u> that the order was carried out. Translate in a way that makes this clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So King Darius gave the order, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions’ den.

Probably the meaning is that he was brought <u>from</u> his home and <u>to</u> the king and the place where the lions were kept. In some languages it may be necessary to supply some of this information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel was brought <u>out</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel was brought <u>to him</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and threw him:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces the next event in the narrative. Having brought him, the king’s men threw Daniel into the den of lions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>threw him into the den of lions:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>threw</em> here indicates that the men pushed Daniel from above so that he fell into the den.

Some commentators therefore interpret this as a statement of confidence in the God of Daniel. However, it could also be a word of comfort. See the NET: “The king consoled Daniel.”</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your God, whom you continually serve, will rescue you. (NET) <em>(NET, KJV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The king hoped and prayed that God would save Daniel.

If that is true in your language, you may say, following the NCV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God you serve all the time (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>continually:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>continually</em> is only used here and in 6:20.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 2004.</span></span> In this context, it implies that Daniel was faithful in worshiping God. He did not ever worship other gods. He worshiped God alone. That is, he worshiped God exclusively. Here are some other ways to translate this idea:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>faithfully (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>so loyally (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deliver you:</strong> The king prayed and hoped that God would protect Daniel and save him from being killed by the lions. The same Aramaic verb is used in 6:14b. However, you may need to translate it differently here. Daniel was already being punished, but the king hoped he would not die. This verb also occurs with this meaning in 3:15f, 6:28. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rescue you (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>save you (NCV)</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den:</strong> A stone was placed over the opening to the lion pit so that Daniel could not try to escape. This verse part contains two passive verbs, <em>was brought</em> and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was</span> <em>placed</em>. In some languages it may be more natural to use one or more active verbs.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a large rock was pushed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>over the mouth of the den:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mouth</em> here means “entrance, opening.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>den:</strong> See the Notes at 6:7e.</p><h4>6:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then the king sealed the rock and stamped the seal with his royal ring and with the rings that belonged to his nobles/officials</p></li><li><p>The king then put a seal on the rock and marked the seal with his royal sign and also with the signs of his important/leading men.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces the next event in the narrative.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The king and his nobles sealed the stone and stamped their marks on the seal.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sealed it with his own signet ring:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>signet ring</em> here refers to a mark that the king put on the closed door of the den.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The king had a ring or cylinder with a small design or initials that he used to mark documents as official.</span></span> Someone probably stretched a piece of cord or cloth across the rock and fastened it to the rock with wet clay. The king then used his signet ring to mark the clay.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Or it could have been a special cylinder.</span></span> If anyone tried to move the rock, they would break the cord and ruin the mark. This way the king and his officials would know if someone tried to open the hole during the night.

You may want to put an explanation in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and the rings of his nobles:</strong> The Aramaic text has the singular form here: “the ring of his nobles.” Each noble probably had one seal or ring each. Therefore, either the singular or plural may be appropriate. Use the form that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to avoid the repetition of the word “ring/rings” by using a pronoun here.

Daniel did his work so well that the other officials became jealous of him. One day they asked the king to pass a law that forbade praying to anyone but him for a period of thirty days. The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him.

The Notes will give some suggestions on how to translate words or phrases that are repeated.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. Verbs of Speech: The author sometimes used more than one verb of speech to introduce a quotation. In some languages, this may not be natural. The Notes will offer some options on how to translate these verbs.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. Synonyms: The author liked to use synonyms or near synonyms to refer to the same idea. For example: 6:7–9 (ordinance, law, decree); 6:14 (rescue, delivering); 6:26 (kingdom, dominion); 6:27b (signs, wonders).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He returned to his palace (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>palace:</strong> See also the Notes at 4:4b, 4:29; 5:5c. This was the special house where the king lived. It was probably very luxurious. If you have a word for this type of house, you can use it here. Other ways to say this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king’s big house</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king’s beautiful rich house</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his official residence.</p></blockquote><h4>6:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and spent the night fasting.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>All night long he did not eat any food.</p></li><li><p>He refused to eat any food the rest of the night.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>spent the night fasting:</strong> This king usually ate when he came home in the evening. However, that night the king was worried about Daniel and he refused to eat anything. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>without food (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to start a new sentence here.

In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an active clause. The Aramaic form of the verb indicates that the king himself refused <em>entertainment</em>.

English versions translate it in different ways. For example:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>it refers to any kind of entertainment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>diversions (RSV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NASB, ESV, NET, GNT, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>it refers to food or drink.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>concubines (NJB) <em>(REB, NJB, GW, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>it refers to music. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>instruments of music (KJV) <em>(KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is likely that the king’s entertainment normally included women who made music and danced for him. However it is not certain that this is what the author was referring to here. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It is more general than the other options.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the footnote in the NET.</span></span> Try to use an expression that refers to entertainment in general, including that provided by drinking companions, women, and musicians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He spent the night alone.</p></blockquote><h4>6:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and sleep fled from him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he was not able to sleep.</p></li><li><p>and he did not get any sleep.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and sleep fled from him:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces another thing the king did not do that night. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that night the king did not eat, receive entertainment, <u>or</u> sleep</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sleep fled from him:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB literally translates as <em>sleep fled from him</em> is a figure of speech. The author described sleep as if it were a person who ran away. Translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. You may have a different idiom that expresses the same idea.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:18</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in 6:18a–d.

The BSB has left the name “Daniel” untranslated. You should indicate that the king went to the lions’ den to speak to Daniel in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When he got there, he called out anxiously (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>When he reached the den:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>When he reached the den</em> is more literally “and as he approached the den.” This clause repeats the mention of the den from the previous verse. In some languages it may not be natural to repeat this information again. If that is true in your language, you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When he got there (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As he approached (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he cried out in a voice of anguish:</strong> The Aramaic verbs of speech that the BSB translates as <em>cried out</em> are literally, “called out…. and the king answering and saying.” In some languages it may be more natural to use one verb of speech, as the BSB has done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he cried out anxiously to Daniel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he called out in anguish (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>cried out:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>cried out</em> means “yelled, shrieked.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>shouted (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in a voice of anguish:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a voice of anguish</em> is literally “a sound of pain/sadness.” The king sounded worried and distressed. In some languages in may be natural to describe the king himself, or the king’s action, rather than his voice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>anxiously (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>in anguish (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>6:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Daniel, you servant of the living God!

Has that God rescued you from the lions?”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O Daniel, servant of the living God:</strong> The king addressed Daniel as the <em>servant</em> of the true God. In this context, the word <em>servant</em> refers to someone who served God by worshiping and obeying him. In some languages it may be natural to translate this noun using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel, you serve/worship the living God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the living God:</strong> The phrase <em>the living God</em> describes God as truly existing and alive. By implication he is powerful to act and able to act to help his servants. This phrase is also used in Matthew 26:63, John 6:69, Deuteronomy 5:26, Joshua 3:10, and 1 Samuel 17:26. See how you translated it there. In some languages, it may be redundant to describe God as <em>living</em>. If that is true in your language, you may have another way to express this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the true God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the God who lives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">forever</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?:</strong> This is a real question. The king was desperate. He asked Daniel if he was still alive. See how you translated 6:16d. Other ways you can translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has your God that you always worship been able to save you from the lions? (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Was your God, whom you serve so faithfully, able to rescue you from the lions? (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your God, whom you serve:</strong> In some languages it may not be natural to use the possessive pronoun <em>your</em> with <em>God</em>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths (NLT) <em>(NLT, REB, NIV, GNT, CEV, NCV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>God himself</u> both sent the angel and shut the lions’ mouths. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My God sent his angel and shut the lions’ mouths (NRSV) <em>(BSB, RSV/NRSV, KJV, NASB, ESV, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">God acted to protect Daniel through the angel he sent. The angel did God’s will and fulfilled his intention. So either way of translating this is acceptable. You may wish to follow the major language version in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My God:</strong> In some languages it may not be natural or correct to use the possessive pronoun <em>My</em> with the word <em>God</em>. If that is true in your language, you may simply say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The God I worship</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His angel:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates <em>His angel</em> refers to a supernatural being who served God. The same word occurs in 3:28b. See “angel” in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>shut the mouths of the lions:</strong> This is a figure of speech. The phrase means, “prevented the lions from eating Daniel.” Many versions keep the same figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to close the lions’ mouths (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who sealed the lions’ jaws (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and closed the lions’ jaws<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>GeCL97.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he sent an angel to keep the lions from eating me (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They have not hurt me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The lions did not hurt me</p></li><li><p>so that they did not harm me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They have not hurt me:</strong> The Aramaic text begins this verse part with a connector that introduces a result clause. Because God sent his angel to shut the lions’ mouths, Daniel was not hurt. The BSB leaves this idea implied, but in some languages it may be natural to say explicitly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>so that</u> they have not harmed me (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> they have not injured me</p></blockquote><h4>6:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for I was found innocent in His sight,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because God judged me innocent.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God did this</span> because he knew I was not guilty.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> here introduces the reason why God rescued Daniel. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He did this because (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was found innocent in His sight:</strong> The Aramaic phrase is literally, “before him innocence was found to me.” This is a passive clause. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he considered me innocent (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he judged me innocent (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he knew that I was not guilty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>innocent:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>innocent</em> here indicates that God saw that Daniel had not done wrong or evil. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>blameless (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not guilty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in His sight:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>in His sight</em> means, “in front of” or “in the presence of.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>HALOT, 1967. See 6:10e, where the same word is included in the phrase that the BSB translates as “to his God.”</span></span> The phrase implies that Daniel was living in view of someone (God) who was more important than he. Daniel knew that God was always watching him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions omit this phrase because the meaning is implied by the context. Translate in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>6:22d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:22d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I have done no wrong against you, O king.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Also, I have never wronged you, my king.”</p></li><li><p>Moreover, I have never committed any crime against you, sir.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here joins 6:22c with 6:22d. English versions interpret it differently.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The connector introduces an additional comment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and moreover (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and also (NRSV) <em>(BSB, RSV/NRSV, NIV, REB, KJV, NASB, ESV, NET, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The connector gives a second reason why God shut the lions’ mouths. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and because (GNT) <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) is recommended. In some languages, this idea is implied by the context. For example, some English versions do not explicitly translate the connector (CEV, NCV, GW). Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have done no wrong against you:</strong> See the Notes at 6:22d. The phrase <em>against you</em> implies that the king had higher status and was more important than Daniel. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nor have I done any harm to you (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have not wronged you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have never done anything to hurt you (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wrong:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>wrong</em> refers to any sort of hurt or damage, whether physical, financial, emotional, or material. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>injury (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>harm (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O king:</strong> See how you translated this at 6:6b.</p>",

Everyone could see that Daniel was unharmed. In your translation, be sure that it is clear that <em>no wounds whatsoever were found</em> because there was no wound. Daniel was unharmed. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as an active clause.

The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him.

This is a figure of speech. It means “who had accused/denounced Daniel.” This phrase refers to the officials and administrators who told the king that Daniel was breaking the law by praying to God. See 6:13. Note that their accusation was not literally “false.” Daniel had in fact been praying to his God. The accusation, however, was made out of envy and concerned an unjust law.

The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as a passive verb, <em>were brought</em>, is literally active, “they brought,” The subject “they” is indefinite. The king’s men, the king’s soldiers, went to the homes of these officials, and forced them to go to the lions’ den. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb.

See how you translated the same verb in 2:34c, 2:40b, 2:44d, where the same verb is used of the stone <u>shattering</u> the image. The text implies that the lions were very hungry.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I wish you peace and prosperity (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I wish you great peace and wealth (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Modern English greetings do not give the exact same emphasis as the Aramaic one. This was not a casual greeting but a formal one. It is good to use a formal, official expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I extend my greetings to you all.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I trust that you all are flourishing/prospering.</p></blockquote>",

Daniel did his work so well that the other officials became jealous of him. One day they asked the king to pass a law that forbade praying to anyone but him for a period of thirty days. The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him.

This paragraph tells of King Darius’ reaction to Daniel’s rescue. He wrote a letter to the people in his kingdom, honoring Daniel’s God.</p></div><h4>6:26a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:26a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I hereby decree</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">King Darius</span> make the following law:</p></li><li><p>I declare/command the following:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I hereby decree:</strong> See the Notes at 3:29a. The Aramaic expression that the BSB translates as <em>I hereby decree</em> is literally “from before me is set a command.” Emphasis is on the phrase “from before me.” It was the king himself who gave the command. Other ways English versions translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I command (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I decree (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hereby order the following:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>decree:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>decree</em> in this context means “command.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>ṭeʿem</em> “command.” HALOT, 1885.</span></span> It also occurs in Daniel 3:10a, 3:29a, and 4:6a.</p><h4>6:26b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:26b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that in every part of my kingdom, men are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Everyone in my kingdom is to fear Daniel’s God and revere him,</p></li><li><p>Everyone whom I rule must tremble with fear and awe before the God whom Daniel worships.</p></li><li><p>Everyone in my kingdom must fear and respect the God whom Daniel serves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in every part of my kingdom:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in every part of my kingdom</em> is more literally “in all the dominion of my kingdom.” In this context it refers to all the land where the king ruled. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>throughout my kingdom/realm</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>throughout my empire (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>everywhere I rule</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The decree was sent to <u>all the people</u> in every area of his kingdom. In some languages it may be necessary to make this idea explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>among all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span> over whom I rule</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span> in my kingdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>men are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel:</strong> The Aramaic clause is literally, “there shall be trembling and fearing before the God of Daniel.” The two verbs meaning “tremble” and “fear” occur together both here and in 5:19a, where the BSB translates them as “trembled” and “fear.” See the notes there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The king was commanding that everyone should recognize the power of the God whom Daniel worshipped. They should honor him highly. English versions translate this in different ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>with two verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fear and respect (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>with one verb or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tremble with terror (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tremble in fear</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Different languages have different ways to describe the way that people react when they are afraid. Choose an expression that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>shake with fear</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men:</strong> The word <em>men</em> refers to people in general, both men and women.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men and women</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the God of Daniel:</strong> The phrase <em>God of Daniel</em> here means “the God whom Daniel worshiped.”</p><h4>6:26c–27</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These verses are written in Hebrew poetic style. You should translate these verses in the same way you have translated Hebrew poetry elsewhere in the Old Testament. See the Notes at 2:20–23; 4:3; 4:34–35. Some English versions put each verse part on a new line to show the parallelism. You may wish to show that this is poetry in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He is a living God, (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and he will rule forever.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His kingdom will never be destroyed,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and his power will never come to an end.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He saves and rescues;</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he performs wonders and miracles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in heaven and on earth.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He saved Daniel from being killed by the lions.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it is unnatural to repeat information like this, so translators combine the information in the parallel lines. You will need to decide how best to translate the parallel lines in your language.</p><h4>6:26c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:26c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For He is the living God, and He endures forever;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he is the God who truly lives and lives forever.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You must fear him</span> because he is the true God who/and will live forever</p></li><li><p>For he is the God who always lives, forever and ever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Aramaic connector that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> here introduces the reason for the king’s command. Introduce this reason in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He is the living God:</strong> See the Notes at 6:20b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A similar phrase is used in 4:34: “the one who lives forever.” Elsewhere in the O.T. is in Deuteronomy 5:26; Joshua 3:10; 1 Samuel 17:26.</span></span> The king said that God was living, that is, powerful and active. In some languages it may be redundant to describe God as <em>living</em>. If that is true in your language, you may have another way to express this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the God who exists/acts</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the true God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Lucas (p. 158) notes that the epithet stresses the uniqueness of God, in contrast to idols.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and He endures forever:</strong> This line repeats the information from 6:26c in different words. Some versions begin a new line with this verse part to show the parallel lines.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>He endures forever</em> means that God lives forever. See the Notes at 4:26b. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who continues forever (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will endure forever (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He lives forever (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>forever:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>forever</em> refers to the indefinite future, all ages to come. In this context, it indicates that God will always live.</p><h4>6:26d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:26d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>His kingdom will never be destroyed, and His dominion will never end.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No one will ever destroy his kingdom. He will rule forever.</p></li><li><p>No one will ever take away his power. His authority to rule will never end.</p></li><li><p>No one will ever be able to overthrow his kingdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His kingdom will never be destroyed:</strong> The clause <em>His kingdom will never be destroyed</em> indicates that nothing and no one will ever put an end to God’s rule, his kingly reign over his creation. This is a passive clause. If this is not natural in your language, you may translate it as an active clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no one shall ever destroy his kingdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no one will ever be able to overthrow his rule</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His reign will never cease<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BFrCL88.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kingdom:</strong> See the Notes at 2:37b. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>kingdom</em> here refers to God’s reign or power to rule. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His kingly power (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His reign</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His dominion will never end:</strong> This line repeats the meaning of the previous line, but in a different way. In some languages it may not be natural to repeat information like this. If that is true in your language you may combine the two lines in 6:26d. See the example in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>will never end</em> is literally “to the end.” There are at least two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a negative statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His dominion has no end.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and his rule will never end (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his power will never come to an end (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a positive statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His authority is to the end (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His power lasts to the end of time. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his sovereignty will last forever<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BFrCL88.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you choose to use an expression such as “to the end,” as in the GW, make sure that your readers will not think that God’s power will eventually end, when time itself comes to an end.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dominion:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>dominion</em> is a synonym to the word “kingdom.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span><em>šalṭan</em> “dominion.” HALOT, 1995.</span></span> See also the Notes at 4:3d; 4:22d, 4:34e. In this context, it means:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his power (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sovereignty (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>authority (NET)</p></blockquote>",

Daniel did his work so well that the other officials became jealous of him. One day they asked the king to pass a law that forbade praying to anyone but him for a period of thirty days. The king signed the law. Daniel, however, refused to obey it and continued to pray to the one true God, the God of Israel. When the king heard that Daniel had disobeyed the law, he ordered his soldiers to throw Daniel into the pit where he kept hungry lions. But God protected Daniel. The lions did not hurt him. When the king saw this, he punished Daniel’s enemies and honored Daniel and the God of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Other possible headings for this section include:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel in the Pit of Lions (GNT)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel and the Lions (NCV)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">God protected Daniel from lions</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Historical Background</u>: The Persian empire under Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539/538 BC, when Daniel was over seventy years old.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Daniel was taken captive and brought to Babylon in approximately 605 B.C. If he was 12 years old when he came, he would have been 78 when this story began.</span></span> The Persian empire became larger than the Babylonian empire had ever been. It extended west to include both Egypt and Libya. It extended east as far as the Indus River in what is now Pakistan. It was the largest empire in the history of the world up to that time.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some commentators think that Darius the Mede was another name or title for the Persian King Cyrus or for the governor under him, Gubaru.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Text:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The verse numbers in the NJPS and the NJB are different from the verse numbers in the BSB. For example, 6:1 in the NJPS and the NJB is 5:31 in the BSB. The difference is because the NJPS and NJB follow the numbers in the Hebrew Bible. These Notes follow the verse numbers in the BSB.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Special Problems:</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">1. Lists: The author liked to include lists. In Daniel 6, he listed the different officials who conspired against Daniel (6:1–2; 7). Some languages may not have so many terms for officials. The Notes will suggest some ways to translate these lists.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">2. Repetition: The author liked to repeat words and phrases in order to create suspense and emphasis. The Notes will give some suggestions on how to translate words or phrases that are repeated.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3. Verbs of Speech: The author sometimes used more than one verb of speech to introduce a quotation. In some languages, this may not be natural. The Notes will offer some options on how to translate these verbs.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">4. Synonyms: The author liked to use synonyms or near synonyms to refer to the same idea. For example: 6:7–9 (ordinance, law, decree); 6:14 (rescue, delivering); 6:26 (kingdom, dominion); 6:27b (signs, wonders). The Notes will suggest different ways to translate these terms.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027006028\" data-endVerseId=\"1027006028\"><h3>Paragraph 6:28</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse concludes chapter 6.

He continued to be prosperous/successful when Cyrus the Persian became king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>So</em> here introduces the conclusion to the narrative. Introduce this conclusion in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel prospered:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>prospered</em> here indicates that Daniel was successful politically and materially. Things went well for him. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All went well for Daniel (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel was successful (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel’s life went well</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Daniel:</strong> The Aramaic text has a demonstrative pronoun before the name Daniel: “This Daniel.” In this context it puts the focus away from the king and back on Daniel. You may translate this pronoun if it is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This Daniel (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This man, Daniel, (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>during the reign of Darius:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>reign</em> can have different meanings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See HALOT, 1917.</span></span> In this context it refers to the period of time when Darius ruled the Persian empire. See 6:26d, where the BSB translates it as “kingdom,” and the note on <em>Darius</em> at 6:1. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>while Darius was king (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when Darius ruled</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the reign of Cyrus the Persian:</strong> See the Notes at 1:21. Cyrus was the king of Persia from 539–530 B.C. Other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and when Cyrus the Persian ruled</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when Cyrus the Persian was king (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In this second division, the second half of the book, Daniel recorded dreams that God gave him. These dreams contained many symbolic figures and strange animals. The events symbolized world events, the rise and fall of kings and kingdoms, and the dream emphasized God’s control over world history.</p>",

The repetition serves to emphasize what happened: Daniel had a noteworthy dream. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Daniel had a dream. He saw visions (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>While Daniel was dreaming, he had a vision</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Daniel had a dream:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>Daniel had a dream</em> is literally “Daniel saw a dream.” Use the verb that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel dreamed a dream</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>visions passed through his mind:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>visions passed through his mind</em> is literally “the visions of his head.” The BSB has supplied the verb phrase <em>passed through</em>. The Aramaic word for <em>visions</em> is closely related to the word “saw” (BSB: “had”) in the previous clause. These <em>visions</em> are what Daniel saw in his dream. You may use the plural form (<em>visions</em>) or singular (“a vision”), whichever is most natural in this context.</p><h4>7:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as he lay on his bed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as he was lying in bed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">asleep</span>,</p></li><li><p>while he was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sleeping</span> one night.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as he lay on his bed:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>as he lay on his bed</em> is literally “on his bed.” This indicates that Daniel was lying down and sleeping at the time he had this dream. Where he was sleeping is not important or in focus. In some cultures people do not sleep on beds. Express the idea that Daniel was lying down to sleep in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>while I was asleep one night (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He wrote down the dream, and this is the summary of his account.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he wrote a summary/account of what he had dreamed.</p></li><li><p>He then wrote down what he had dreamed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He wrote down the dream, and this is the summary of his account:</strong> The Aramaic text is more literally “he wrote the dream the head of things he said.” There are two ways to interpret this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The two clauses refer to the same action, the recording of the dream that follows. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then he wrote down the dream (NRSV) <em>(NIV, NET, NRSV, GW, GNT, possibly KJV, ESV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The two clauses refer to two different actions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then he wrote the dream down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> related the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">following</span> summary of it (NASB) <em>(BSB, NASB, NJB, GNT, REB, possibly RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This kind of repetition is a common feature of the writing in the book of Daniel. Here Daniel was introducing the written record of his dream. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then he wrote down the dream in summary fashion (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He wrote down the main parts of the dream. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the summary of his account:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the summary of his account</em> is more literally “the head/chief of matters/things.” There are two ways to interpret the word “head/chief” in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “summary, record, report of the most important details.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in summary fashion (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this is the record (GNT) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NIV, RSV, ESV, NET, GW, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “beginning.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this is how the narrative began (NJB) <em>(NJB, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.</p>",

In the BSB, as in the Aramaic, there are two clauses connected with the word <em>and</em>. However, it may be natural to connect these ideas in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I had a dream <u>in which</u> I saw the four winds of heaven.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was watching in my visions during the night <u>as</u> the four winds of heaven… (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In my visions at night, I, Daniel, saw the four winds of heaven (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>7:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Daniel declared: “In my vision in the night I looked,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ This is Daniel’s summary/account: In my vision in the night, I was watching</p></li><li><p>¶ He wrote this: In my vision I could see</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Daniel declared:</strong> The words <em>Daniel declared</em> form the immediate introduction to the dream account. After this the narrative switches to the first person, with Daniel referring to himself as “I.” If the previous verse part, 7:1d, is a sufficient introduction to the narrative, it may not be necessary to translate these words explicitly. In other languages it may be natural to indicate that Daniel was writing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is what Daniel wrote:</p></blockquote><h4>7:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and suddenly the four winds of heaven</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I saw winds blowing from all four directions.</p></li><li><p>winds begin to blow from north, south, east, and west.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and suddenly the four winds of heaven:</strong> The phrase <em>and suddenly</em> introduces what appeared in front of Daniel, That is, it introduces what he saw in his dream. The Aramaic is more literally “and lo/behold! The four winds of the heavens.” In some languages it may not be natural to say that Daniel <u>saw</u> the four winds, since what he actually saw was what the four winds did. They created a storm, which blew across the water. See the General Comment on 7:2a–b. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and…the wind was blowing from all four directions (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the four winds of heaven:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>the four winds of heaven</em> refers to winds that blow from the north, south, east, and west. The word <em>heaven</em> in this context refers to the sky. Since winds always blow in the sky, in some languages it may be natural to leave this untranslated. Here are some ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wind/winds from all directions</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">was blowing</span> from the north, south, east and west.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>strong winds blowing from every direction (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>were churning up the great sea.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They stirred/tossed the vast/huge sea.</p></li><li><p>They blew on the ocean and made/caused big waves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>were churning up the great sea:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>churning up</em> means “stirring up.” The winds were causing large waves to form on the sea. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lashing the surface of the ocean (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which made the sea very rough (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the great sea:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the great sea</em> refers to a large expanse of water. In this context it probably refers to the Mediterranean Sea. You could indicate this in a footnote.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:2a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to indicate that what Daniel actually saw in his dream was the effect of the four winds on the great sea.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a-b</sup>In my vision that night, I, Daniel, saw a great storm churning the surface of a great sea, with strong winds blowing from every direction.

Since this is against expectation, in some languages it may be natural to translate the conjunction with a word indicating contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an eagle:</strong> The <em>eagle</em> is a very large bird that attacks and eats small mammals. See how you translated eagle in Exodus 19:4, Psalm 103:5, and Revelation 4:7 and 8:13.</p><h4>7:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I watched until its wings were torn off</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I continued to look at the beast and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">suddenly</span> its wings were pulled/plucked off.</p></li><li><p>I saw someone remove the creature&apos;s wings</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I watched until its wings were torn off:</strong> While Daniel was watching, someone removed the wings of the beast. The phrase <em>were torn off</em> is passive and so who did this is not stated. There are two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as I looked, its wings were torn off (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb with a general subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone/they tore off its wings</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>7:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and it was lifted up from the ground</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was raised from the ground</p></li><li><p>and make it stand upright.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and it was lifted up from the ground:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates as <em>it was lifted up from the ground</em> here probably indicates that someone forced or caused the creature to rise up on its hind legs. The phrase <em>it was lifted up</em> is also passive and so the subject is not indicated. There are again two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was lifted to an upright position (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was raised from the ground</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb with a general subject.

It was forced to stand upright, on its two back legs. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that it stood on two feet like a human being (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and made to stand up straight (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and set standing on its feet like a human (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and given the mind of a man:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>mind</em> is literally “heart.” In Hebrew thinking the heart was the center of thinking and reasoning as well as feeling. So this verse part indicates that the beast began to think like a human being. It is a passive clause, and there are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and was given a human mind (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and it was made able to think like a human</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it received the mind of a human</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it received the ability to think like a human being</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Many scholars think that this refers to Nebuchadnezzar and his acceptance of God’s rule in his life. In your translation, try to allow for this possibility but do not make it explicit.</p><h4>7:4f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:4f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and given the mind of a man.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and it received a human mind.</p></li><li><p>and it was allowed to start thinking like a person/man.</p></li></ul></div>",

Here, it introduces what Daniel saw next. That is, it introduces what happened next in Daniel’s dream. In some languages it may be natural to translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Suddenly another beast appeared, which looked like a bear:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>Suddenly</em> is literally “and lo/behold!” as in 7:2a-b. Daniel called attention to what he saw next, a beast that resembled a bear.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many scholars think that this second beast refers either to the kingdom of the Medes or to Medo-Persia. However, this should not be made explicit in your translation. You may wish to write a footnote indicating that this is a common understanding.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The second beast looked like a bear (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>another beast appeared, which looked like a bear:</strong> The second beast that arose from the sea looked like a bear. In your translation, make sure that it is clear that this was not the second beast to look like a bear. In some languages it may be natural to make this clear by translating this as two clauses:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a second beast arose and this second beast looked like a bear</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I saw a second animal. It looked like a bear. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then I saw a second beast, and it looked like a bear. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>a bear:</strong> In this dream the <em>bear</em> appears as an image of a dangerous and aggressive empire. Use a word for a species of bear that is known to attack and eat other animals. See how you referred to this type of animal in 1 Samuel 17:34–37 and 2 Kings 2:24.</p><h4>7:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It was raised up on one of its sides,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It had raised itself up on one side,</p></li><li><p>It was crouching/rearing,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It was raised up on one of its sides:</strong> The Aramaic text says, “it was raised to one side.” The BSB has translated this literally, but the position of the bear is not clear. It appears that the bear was crouched on the ground, perhaps rearing up in front. The verb <em>It was raised up</em> is passive, and the subject is not stated. However, the emphasis is on the bear’s position, not on how it got there. Here are some possible translations</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>its front was raised</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rearing up</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was crouching on the ground, starting to rise</p></blockquote><h4>7:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and three <span data-bnType=\"implied\">animal</span> ribs were in its mouth between its teeth.</p></li><li><p>and with its teeth it was holding/<span data-bnType=\"implied\">chewing</span> three ribs <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from its prey/victim</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth:</strong> There are two ways to understand this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The bear was holding parts of an animal in its mouth. This implies that it was in the process of eating that animal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There were three ribs in its mouth between its teeth (NET) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, ESV, RSV, ESV, NET, GW, REB, NJB, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Besides having teeth, the bear had three tusks growing there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>had three tusks in its mouth among its teeth (NRSV) <em>(NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the great majority of English versions. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It held three ribs in its teeth (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was holding three ribs between its teeth (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Its teeth were holding/clasping three <span data-bnType=\"implied\">animal</span> ribs</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>three ribs:</strong> The <em>three ribs</em> probably symbolized three countries that the kingdom represented by the bear had conquered. You should not make this explicit, but translate in a way that allows for this understanding.</p><h4>7:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So it was told, ‘Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Someone said to the beast, “Get up!

In order to avoid the wrong meaning that the ribs were talking, the BSB has translated this as a passive verb phrase. In some languages it may be possible to use a general pronoun such as one:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone said to it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!:</strong> The Aramaic text that the BSB translates as <em>Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!</em> is literally “Arise! Eat much flesh!” The bear was commanded to get up and kill and eat many other animals. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Get up and eat as much meat as you want. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Go on, eat as much meat as you can! (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gorge yourself on flesh!:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>gorge yourself on flesh</em> is more literally “Eat much flesh.” It is implied that the bear was to attack and kill many other animals, and then he could eat them. The CEV has made the implied information explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Attack! Eat all the flesh you want. (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:5d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to use indirect speech for this command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was told to get up and eat its fill of flesh</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it was ordered to go and eat a lot of meat</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it received the command to kill and eat all the flesh it wanted</p></blockquote></div>",

It is not clear whether or not he could hear what the mouth was saying. Possibly he just knew or understood this in some way. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It also had a mouth, and the mouth was bragging.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>9</sup>As I looked:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Thrones of judgment were set in place,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Ancient of Days seated himself.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His clothes were white like snow,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The hair of his head, pure as wool.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Fiery his throne,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Blazing its wheels!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10</sup>A river of fire poured out,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Streaming from his presence.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A thousand thousands were serving him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Tens of thousands of his servants</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were standing before him.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The court sat in judgment,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the books were opened.</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>A river of fire was flowing, coming out from His presence.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A fire/fiery river/stream poured from in front of the throne.</p></li><li><p>From his presence fire streamed/gushed out like a river.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>A river of fire was flowing:</strong> The Aramaic clause that the BSB translates literally as <em>A river of fire was flowing</em> is a metaphor. It compares the fire that was issuing from the throne of God to a river of water that moves forward rapidly. There are several ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keeping the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and a stream of fire was pouring out (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fire flowed out like a river</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translating the meaning of the comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fire gushed out</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>A river of fire:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>A river of fire</em> means “a river consisting of fire.” This is in contrast to a normal <em>river</em> consisting of water. In your translation, it is good to use a word that refers to a large quantity of moving water or fire.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>was flowing:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>was flowing</em> refers to the movement of a liquid such as water. Try to use a word that can be used of the movement of both water and fire. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was streaming forth (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>was pouring out (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>coming out from His presence:</strong> The clause <em>coming out from His presence</em> indicates that the fire river issued from the Ancient of Days, from God himself on his throne. In the Aramaic this is a separate clause, “and it came out from before him.” Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and came forth from before him (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and proceeding from his presence (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:10a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine the two clauses into one. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and a stream of fire was pouring out from it (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">However, if you do this, it may be difficult to maintain the poetic structure of the verse. See the introductory comment on 7:9–10.</p></div><h4>7:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Thousands upon thousands attended Him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Many thousands <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of people/angels</span> were serving him there.</p></li><li><p>Great crowds/numbers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his servants</span> were there,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Thousands upon thousands attended Him:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>attended</em> means “served, ministered to.” There were many thousands of beings there, God’s servants. These could have been people or angels. Apparently they looked like people, because nothing is said about their appearance. So it is acceptable to say</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Thousands and thousands <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of people</span> attended him.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There were many thousands of people there to serve him (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>7:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and myriads upon myriads stood before Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Hundreds of thousands of people/angels were standing in his presence <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ready to obey him</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">yes,</span> multitudes/millions were waiting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to serve him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>myriads upon myriads stood before Him:</strong> This is parallel to 7:10b, and states the same thing in other words, using a stronger expression. God’s servants were so many that Daniel could not count them and used an expression meaning “a vast number.” Use a phrase that refers to a huge innumerable crowd. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>millions stood before him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>countless numbers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of his servants</span> were present</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:10b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The repetition of the information emphasizes the expression. In some languages it may be natural to combine the two verse parts 7:10b–c and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and millions of people stood before him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Countless thousands were standing there to serve him. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">However, if you do this, it may be hard to keep the poetic and parallel structure of 7:10. See also the General Comment on 7:10a.</p></div><h4>7:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The court was convened,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The members of the court sat down <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the thrones</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to judge</span>,</p></li><li><p>Then the judges <span data-bnType=\"implied\">came</span> and took their seats/places</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The court was convened:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>The court</em> here refers to the judges who made up the court. They sat down as a sign that they were ready to begin judging. In some languages it will be good to make this explicit. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The court sat in judgment. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The court began its session (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The judges took their seats.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the act of sitting may not imply that the judges were about to judge. It may imply that they were resting. If this is the case in your language, you may wish to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The time of judgment began (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Court was ready to begin (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the books were opened.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they opened the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">record</span> books.</p></li><li><p>and opened the books <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of human actions/deeds</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the books were opened:</strong> The heavenly books <em>were opened</em> in order that the judges could read them. This is a passive verb. There are several ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the books were opened (RSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. The text does not say who opened the books, and the actor is not in focus. So you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they opened the books</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the books lay open (NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must make the actor explicit, it may be best to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the judges</span> opened the books</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Making the subject “the judges” explicit will help to explain the nature and purpose of the books. The judges opened the books (or angels opened the books for the judges) in order that the judges could read them and make just decisions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the books:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the books</em> here refers to heavenly books in which people’s deeds are written. The judges opened and read these books in order to give judgment on each person’s life. See how you translated this idea in Revelation 20:12. In some languages it may be possible to imply the purpose of the books by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the record books</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the books <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of human deeds/actions</span></p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they killed the beast</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the beast:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the beast</em> refers to the fourth beast in the series, the one with the ten horns.

See the notes on Matthew 8:20, Mark 2:10, 28, Luke 6:5, 22, and John 1:51 and John 3:13–14.

However, some other versions follow the Aramaic word order.

He saw the figure of a man approaching the throne of God.</p></div><h4>7:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And He was given dominion, glory, and kingship,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He received power, honor, and the right to rule the kingdom/people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gave him authority <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over the nations</span> and caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span> to honor him and obey him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And He was given dominion, glory, and kingship:</strong> This is a passive clause. It indicates that the one like a son of man received <em>dominion, glory, and kingship</em> from the Ancient of Days. There are at least two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To him was given ruling authority, honor, and sovereignty (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He was crowned king and given power and honor (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He received authority, glory, and sovereign power.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Ancient of Days</span> gave him authority, glory, and sovereign power.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dominion, glory, and kingship:</strong> In this context these three ideas have similar meanings. The repetition serves to emphasize the idea, that this one like a son of man received all power to rule the earth. If you are unable to use three separate nouns or noun phrases, you may be able to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all authority/power and great glory</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>dominion:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>dominion</em> means “power to rule.” See how you translated this word in 4:34e and 7:6e. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a clause with a verb and an object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>he ruled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all nations</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>glory:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em> here means “honor.” See how you translated this word in 2:6b. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a clause with a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">everyone</span> honored him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>kingship:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>kingship</em> is literally “a kingdom.” See how you translated this in 2:29a. The Ancient of Days caused the one like a son of man to reign as king over a kingdom. In this context, the kingdom does not refer to one specific country out of many, but to the entire world, as the next verse part makes clear. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>he ruled as king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>he reigned</p></blockquote><h4>7:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that the people of every nation and language should serve Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The people of every nation and language worshiped him.</p></li><li><p>All over the world people served him, whatever their race and language.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that the people of every nation and language should serve Him:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>serve</em> can also be translated as “pay reverence to” or “worship.” It normally refers to the worship that is only given to God. See 3:12d and 3:14b, where the same verb is used.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways of understanding the relationship of this verse part to the previous verse part:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates something that happened along with and as a result of 7:14a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and all peoples, nations and languages became his servants (NJB) <em>(NIV, NJB, NET, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a purpose clause and indicates the purpose of 7:14a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the people of all nations, races, and languages would serve him (GNT) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, GNT, RSV/NRSV, ESV, CEV, REB, GNT, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The one like a son of man was given power and so everyone worshiped him. However, in some languages the difference between the two interpretations may be very slight and simply a matter of emphasis. Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All peoples, nations, and language groups were serving him. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People of every tribe, nation and language served him. (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>His rule will endure forever. It will never come to an end,</p></li><li><p>He will rule forever, yes, for all time/ages to come.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB here twice translates as <em>dominion</em> is the same as the word translated as “dominion” in 7:14a. The authority of this son of man will never end. This is stated in two different ways, one positive and one negative (<em>is an everlasting dominion</em> and <em>will not pass away</em>). This repetition gives emphasis to the idea. In some languages it may be natural to use two separate clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His rule is eternal—it will never end (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Emphasize the meaning in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Unending his rule, unfailing his kingdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will surely rule for ever and ever</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His dominion is an everlasting dominion:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>His dominion is an everlasting dominion</em> is the same as in 4:34e. See how you translated it there. In some languages it may be natural to translate the abstract noun dominion as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will rule forever (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that will not pass away:</strong> The Aramaic phrase indicates that the dominion of the son of man will not come to an end. It will endure forever. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his kingdom is eternal (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>no, never will it be destroyed.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">No enemy</span> will ever overcome/conquer his/that kingdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed:</strong> The Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces another way of saying almost the same thing as the previous verse part. In some languages it may be more natural to begin a new sentence and leave the conjunction implied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His kingdom will never be destroyed. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His kingdom is one that will never be destroyed:</strong> The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>will never be destroyed</em> here indicates that the rule of the son of man will never come to an end. No other king or ruler will be able to overcome him. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his kingdom would never end (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No other power will ever conquer his kingdom!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one will overcome him!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a positive statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his kingdom will endure forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will reign <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over all people</span> for all time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>His kingdom:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>kingdom</em> here refers to kingship, the right and power to rule as king. See how you translated this in 4:34f and the notes on 4:34e–f. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>his kingly power (REB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:14c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The two verse parts say the same thing in three different ways to emphasize the thought. If such repetition is unnatural in your language, you may wish to combine the verse parts into one or two emphatic statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will rule for all time. He will never ever cease to reign!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His rule/dominion will be eternal, unending, victorious!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will be king forever, for all time to come.</p></blockquote></div>",

This idiom here indicates that Daniel felt disturbed or unhappy in his inner being. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and about the ten horns that were on its head (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">But it in many languages it will be more natural to begin a new sentence here, as the BSB has done.

Daniel compared the little horn to the other ten horns and indicated that its <em>appearance was more imposing</em>. The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>imposing</em> is a general word often translated as “great.” In this context it refers to appearing important or powerful, rather than large.

If you must indicate where he came to, you should indicate that he came to earth, or to his people.</p><h4>7:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he gave judgment in favor of the holy people, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people belonging to him,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> Most High.</p></li><li><p>and judged in their favor,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High:</strong> God <em>pronounced judgment in favor of</em> his people. This means that he declared them to be innocent, or in the right. It is implied that he then saved them from the aggression of the final horn.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pronounced judgment:</strong> God acted as judge and issued his decision. Use an expression that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>judged</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gave/declared his decision</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the saints of the Most High:</strong> See how you translated this in 7:18a.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 7:22a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Since the subject of the verbs in this verse part is the Ancient of Days, God himself, in some languages it may be necessary to say “his own people.” It is important to avoid the wrong meaning that the Ancient of Days is someone different from the Most High. It may be helpful to avoid this wrong meaning by following the NLT:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the Ancient One—the Most High—came and judged in favor of his holy people (NLT)</p></blockquote></div><h4>7:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the time came for them to possess the kingdom.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then the right time came and they received the power to rule.</p></li><li><p>and so in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> time they began to rule/reign over the land.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the time came for them to possess the kingdom:</strong> It is implied that at this point the little horn was defeated. It had lost all its power to defeat God’s people and all its greatness and power to rule. Instead, God’s holy people <em>possess the kingdom</em>. This was the result of God’s coming and judgment. In some languages it may be natural to indicate this by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>and so</u> the time came when God’s people possessed the kingdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the time came:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the time came</em> can also be translated as “the appointed time arrived.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for them to possess the kingdom:</strong> The common Aramaic conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> here introduces what happened when the time came. In some languages it may be possible to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for God’s people to possess the kingdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>them to possess the kingdom:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>them to possess the kingdom</em> means “they received the authority to rule.” God gave his people the right and power to rule. The text does not state exactly what kingdom they ruled, whether it was the whole earth or one particular land, so it is best to leave this as general as possible. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>then the time came for them to receive the power to rule (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom.

It indicates that he is supreme over anything and anyone else. In your translation, avoid implying that there also exist lesser gods. See how you translated it in 3:26b, 4:2b, and 5:18a. In some languages it may be natural to make it explicit that it is a title of God.

He will make an attempt to do this. The text does not indicate if he will succeed, and it is best not to make this explicit. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and plan to change the appointed times and laws (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the appointed times and laws:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the appointed times</em> refers to the Jewish feasts and festivals. These took place according to the Jewish calendar and were established in accordance with Jewish law. In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order of the two phrases and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their religious laws and festivals (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s Law and the sacred seasons (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>7:25d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:25d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the saints will be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The holy people will be under his power for a time, two times, and half of a time.</p></li><li><p>For three and a half periods of time, he will have power over the people who belong to God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the saints will be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time:</strong> This verse part indicates both that God would allow the evil king to get power over the holy people, and that the king would use this power for a certain set time. In some languages it may be necessary to translate this using two verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and God’s people will be delivered into his power and he will rule/domineer over them for a time, times, and half a time</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and the saints will be given into his hand:</strong> The Aramaic text that the BSB translates as <em>the saints will be given into his hand</em> is literally “they will be given into his hand.” This is an idiom that here indicates that this evil king will be given power over God’s holy people. God will allow him to oppress and persecute them. See how you translated this idiom in 1:2a and in other books such as Mark 9:31, Deuteronomy 3:2 and Joshua 8:1.

Some scholars believe that it means three and a half years (see the GNT and CEV footnote). See also 4:16c and Revelation 12:14c. Translate it here as you did there.</p>",

The phrase <em>will be given</em> is passive. There are at least two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The kingly power, sovereignty, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High.

They will rule over all the kingdoms under heaven with power and greatness (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>the sovereignty</em> is literally “the kingdom.” The three nouns <em>sovereignty</em>, <em>dominion</em>, and <em>greatness</em> together indicate that God’s people will have the right, authority, and ability to rule. In some languages it may be natural to translate this idea without abstract nouns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will be the rulers…the strongest…the greatest</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will rule powerfully and gloriously</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all will submit to them, obey them, and honor them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the kingdoms under all of heaven:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB literally translates as <em>the kingdoms under all of heaven</em> refers to all nations on earth, whether they are ruled by a king, emperor, or president.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the people, the saints of the Most High:</strong> The Aramaic phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the people, the saints of the Most High</em> is more literally “the people of the holy ones of the Most High.” This expression refers to God’s people, those who belong to him. See how you translated the similar phrase (“the holy ones of the Most High”) in 7:18a, 7:22a-b.</p><h4>7:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The kingdom of the Most High will last/endure forever,</p></li><li><p>The Most High God will rule/reign for all time,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom:</strong> There is a problem of interpretation here. The Hebrew singular pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>His</em> can refer either to the Most High God or to the people as a collective entity. The two possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>it refers to God the Most High. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His kingdom is an eternal kingdom (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, NET, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>it refers to the people of God.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The most natural referent of the pronoun translated as <em>His</em> is to the Most High at the end of 7:27a. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His kingdom will last forever (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His kingdom will be eternal (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will reign as king for all time</p></blockquote><h4>7:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"7:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and all rulers will serve and obey Him.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">human</span> authorities will serve him and obey him.”</p></li><li><p>and all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">earthly</span> rulers/authorities will worship him and submit to him.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and all rulers will serve and obey Him:</strong> Again there is a difference in interpretation. The Hebrew pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>Him</em> is singular but it can be understood in one of two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as referring to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all rulers will serve and obey him (NLT) <em>(BSB, KJV, NIV, NASB, NET, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>as referring to God’s people, collectively.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The Aramaic verb that the BSB translates as <em>serve</em> is normally used of rendering service to a deity, rather than to rulers (see 3:12d, 3:18c, 6:16d, 3:20b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all rulers:</strong> The Aramaic word that the BSB translates as <em>rulers</em> can also be translated as “realms, empires.” In the singular it normally means “dominion, sovereignty.” Here it probably refers to those who have power within every realm or nation.</p>",

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn. That little horn grew as high as the stars, as high as the army of heaven, and as high as the commander of the army. When it was at its highest, it stopped the daily sacrifices and desecrated the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel Gabriel came to Daniel and explained the meaning of what he had seen. The ram and the goat represented kings and their kingdoms. The little horn represented a particularly wicked king. That king would even defy God, but in the end that wicked king would be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions have two headings within this section. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NET Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NRSV Vision of a Ram and a Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Gabriel Interprets the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Angel Gabriel Explains the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">BFrCL88 Second vision: the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation of the second vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GeCL97 A second vision: The battle between the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the vision of the ram and the goat (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are a number of similarities between chapter eight and chapter seven. For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way. Even Daniel did not understand the full meaning of what he saw.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027008001\" data-endVerseId=\"1027008002\"><h3>Paragraph 8:1–2</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph gives the setting of this new vision.</p></div><h4>8:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ When King Belshazzar was in the third year of his reign,</p></li><li><p>¶ During the third year that Belshazzar was king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Babylonia</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ After King Belshazzar had ruled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Babylon</span> for more than two years,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar:</strong> See the Notes at 1:1a; 2:1a.

Then</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reign:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>reign</em> here refers to the period of time when Belshazzar was the king of Babylonia. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this idea with a verb.

It is something that a person sees, but not with his normal sight. It differs from a dream in that a person does not have to be asleep to see a vision.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Daniel the Hebrew words that the BSB translates as “dream” and <em>vision</em> are often used interchangeably.

In some languages, it may not be natural to use both the name and the pronoun.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In order to make it clear that Daniel was the writing these words, the CEV begins the chapter with the phrase: “Daniel wrote:”.</p><h4>8:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>subsequent to the one that had appeared to me earlier.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This vision followed/succeeded the vision I had seen previously.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">two years</span> after the first vision.</p></li><li><p>It was a successor/sequel to the one I had seen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">two years</span> earlier.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>subsequent to the one that had appeared to me earlier:</strong> This clause means that the vision recorded in Daniel 8 came to him after the vision that Daniel saw in Daniel 7. In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This vision came after the one I saw earlier (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I saw this vision after the one I had seen before.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause repeats information from 8:1b.

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn. That little horn grew as high as the stars, as high as the army of heaven, and as high as the commander of the army. When it was at its highest, it stopped the daily sacrifices and desecrated the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel Gabriel came to Daniel and explained the meaning of what he had seen. The ram and the goat represented kings and their kingdoms. The little horn represented a particularly wicked king. That king would even defy God, but in the end that wicked king would be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions have two headings within this section. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NET Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NRSV Vision of a Ram and a Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Gabriel Interprets the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Angel Gabriel Explains the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">BFrCL88 Second vision: the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation of the second vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GeCL97 A second vision: The battle between the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the vision of the ram and the goat (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are a number of similarities between chapter eight and chapter seven. For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way.

Many English translations simplify this introduction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In this vision I saw myself in Susa, the citadel (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the vision I was at the fortress of Susa (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should introduce what Daniel saw in his vision in a way that is natural in your language. Try to use a style that indicates the importance of what is to come, the dream narrative.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I saw myself:</strong> Daniel indicated that he himself was present in the vision. There are different ways to translate this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I suddenly found myself (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I knew/believed myself to be</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the citadel of Susa:</strong> This is more literally “I was in Susa the citadel.” This probably indicates that Susa itself was a citadel, a fortified city.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the footnote in the NET.</span></span> Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the walled city of Susa (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Susa:</strong> The Hebrew spelling of this word is “Shushan,” as in the KJV. <em>Susa</em> is the Greek form of the name. Either spelling is acceptable. You may wish to spell this the same way as it is spelled in the national language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the province of Elam:</strong> Susa was the capital of the province called Elam. This was in the southwest part of what is now Iran.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Genesis 10:22, where Elam is listed as one of the sons of Shem.</span></span> There are different ways to translate this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in Elam province</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the district of Elam</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which is located in the province of Elam (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>province:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>province</em> refers to a large unit of government. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>district</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>area (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>8:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I saw that I was by the Ulai canal.</p></li><li><p>I was conscious/aware that I was next to the Ulai river.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">standing</span> on the bank of the waterway called the Ulai.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Hebrew text this verse part begins with the common Hebrew conjunction that is often translated as “and.” In this context it introduces a more exact explanation of where Daniel was.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal:</strong> The Hebrew words that the BSB literally translates as <em>I saw in the vision</em> repeat information from 8:2a. This repetition may not be natural in some languages, and some ancient and modern versions omit it. However it is present in the MT. The repetition emphasizes that Daniel was not <u>physically</u> present by the canal, but only in his dream. Repeat as much information as necessary to make that clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I saw in the vision, and I was at the river Ulai (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was standing by the Ulai River (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I was beside the Ulai Canal:</strong> Daniel sensed himself to be by the Ulai Canal. He was not actually there, physically. In his dream he was aware that he was looking at events as though he were there. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I saw myself at the Ulai Canal (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was standing by the Ulai Canal. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Ulai Canal:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>Canal</em> here refers to an artificial or manmade stream.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NJB has “gate,” but this is based on some ancient translations (LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate) rather than the Hebrew.</span></span> This canal flowed near the north of the city of Susa. Use the word that is appropriate in your language. The fact that this was an artificial waterway is not in focus, so in some languages it may be most natural to follow the RSV and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>river (RSV)</p></blockquote>",

Use a verb that describes the way an animal such as a goat pushes with its horns.

Scholars have interpreted this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>it refers to increasing in power. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and became strong (NRSV) <em>(NRSV, NJB, NIV, GW, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>it refers to pride and arrogance. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and grew arrogant (GNT) <em>(GNT, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB could support either interpretation (1) or (2). In the Hebrew, the idea is probably that of becoming more and more powerful, as in interpretation (1). Avoid using a verb that suggests growth in virtue or nobility. The verb is used in a negative sense. The ram pushed and bullied other animals to get more power for itself.</p>",

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn. That little horn grew as high as the stars, as high as the army of heaven, and as high as the commander of the army. When it was at its highest, it stopped the daily sacrifices and desecrated the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel Gabriel came to Daniel and explained the meaning of what he had seen. The ram and the goat represented kings and their kingdoms. The little horn represented a particularly wicked king. That king would even defy God, but in the end that wicked king would be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions have two headings within this section. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NET Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NRSV Vision of a Ram and a Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Gabriel Interprets the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Angel Gabriel Explains the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">BFrCL88 Second vision: the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation of the second vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GeCL97 A second vision: The battle between the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the vision of the ram and the goat (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are a number of similarities between chapter eight and chapter seven. For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way.

The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>contemplating</em> can include the ideas of both observing and considering something. Use the verb that is most natural for referring to paying attention to something that is happening in a dream. There is no explicit object, and the BSB has supplied the words <em>all this</em>. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>While I was contemplating all this (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>While I was watching this (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>8:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came out of the west,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I saw a he-goat coming from the west.

Call attention to the appearance of the goat in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there appeared a goat, coming from the west, a great horn protruding between its eyes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>look! a goat came prancing from the west, a long horn on its forehead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a goat:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a goat</em> refers to a male goat. The English words for male goat (buck, billy) are not in common use, so the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a male goat (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a prominent horn between his eyes:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>prominent</em> describes something that can easily be seen, that is, is conspicuous or noticeable. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a conspicuous horn between his eyes (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>came out of the west:</strong> The goat <em>came out of the west</em> from the point of view of someone in Persia. The goat is said in 8:21 to represent Greece, which is west of Persia.</p><h4>8:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>crossing the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It traveled across the entire earth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so quickly that</span> it did not even touch the ground.</p></li><li><p>It rushed/bounded all the way to the east.

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn. That little horn grew as high as the stars, as high as the army of heaven, and as high as the commander of the army. When it was at its highest, it stopped the daily sacrifices and desecrated the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel Gabriel came to Daniel and explained the meaning of what he had seen. The ram and the goat represented kings and their kingdoms. The little horn represented a particularly wicked king. That king would even defy God, but in the end that wicked king would be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions have two headings within this section. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NET Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NRSV Vision of a Ram and a Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Gabriel Interprets the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Angel Gabriel Explains the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">BFrCL88 Second vision: the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation of the second vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GeCL97 A second vision: The battle between the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the vision of the ram and the goat (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are a number of similarities between chapter eight and chapter seven. For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way. Even Daniel did not understand the full meaning of what he saw.</p></div><h4>8:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Thus the goat became very great,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As a result</span>, the goat became very powerful.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> the goat made itself more and more powerful/strong.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Thus the goat became very great:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>became very great</em> is more literally “magnified itself to the extreme.” See how you translated the same verb in 8:4d. Here too this statement has negative implications: the goat was acting wrongly, proudly. He did not become <em>great</em> in a good way. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The he-goat then grew more powerful than ever (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The male goat became very important (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>8:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but when he was at his most powerful, his large horn broke/snapped.</p></li><li><p>However, when it was extremely strong, its big horn <span data-bnType=\"implied\">suddenly</span> broke/fell off.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off:</strong> Scholars agree that the <em>large horn</em> is a reference to the Greek king Alexander the Great. He died suddenly in 323 B.C. after conquering large territories as far away as Egypt and India.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>at the height of his power:</strong> The Hebrew more literally says “just as it became mighty.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his large horn was broken off:</strong> This is a passive clause. The actor is not named. As you translate this, bear in mind that Alexander the Great died from a sudden illness rather than being killed in battle. No human being killed him. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the large horn was broken (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb.

The phrase <em>toward the four winds of heaven</em> here probably indicates that the horns pointed in the direction of the four winds: north, south, east, and west. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and in its place sprouted four majestic horns, pointing to the four winds of heaven (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and in place of this there came up four prominent horns pointing towards the four quarters of heaven (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and there arose four conspicuous horns in its place, extending toward the four winds of the sky (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:8a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to break this long sentence into two or more shorter sentences.

In the large horn’s place grew four prominent horns pointing in the four directions of the earth. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The male goat became very important.

Some scholars say that the Jewish people viewed the stars as visible representations or manifestations of angels or other heavenly beings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Lucas page 215</span></span> Other scholars believe that both stars and the heavenly army could represent or be symbols of God’s people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Steinmann page 402, Miller page 226, Young p. 171.</span></span></p><h4>8:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It grew as high as the host of heaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This horn grew longer/higher until it was as high as the stars/powers in the sky.</p></li><li><p>It grew so great/high/tall that it reached/touched the stars themselves, God’s army.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It grew as high as the host of heaven:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>It grew</em> is the same as in 8:9b. The horn made itself great, claiming and taking more and more power for itself. In the vision, this growth of power was symbolized by a growth in length. The horn appeared to grow longer and longer, reaching to the sky.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the host of heaven:</strong> that the BSB translates as <em>the host of heaven</em> means “the heavenly armies.” This phrase refers to powerful heavenly beings under God’s control.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the footnote in the NET.</span></span> In the dream they are located up in the sky and are associated in some way with the stars. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It grew right up to the armies of heaven. (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The horn was aggressive in its growth; that is, it grew by attacking and defeating other powers. In some languages it may be natural to make this implication explicit. For example, the GNT says:</p><p><em>It grew strong enough to attack the army of heaven</em></p><h4>8:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and trampled them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and trod them down.</p></li><li><p>Then it crushed/kicked them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">into submission</span>.</p></li></ul></div><h4>8:10b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the earth, and trampled them:</strong> In the vision, the horn pulled some of the stars down to the ground and walked over them, symbolically forcing them to submit to it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>some of the host and some of the stars:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>some of the host and some of the stars</em> is more literally “some of the host and/even some of the stars.” The Hebrew conjunction can be translated as <em>and</em> or as “even,” and so there are at two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>the host</em> and <em>the stars</em> are two ways of referring to the same concept. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the stars in the sky, which were heaven’s army (CEV) <em>(NIV, RSV, GNT, REB, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><em>the host</em> and <em>the stars</em> refer to two separate concepts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>some of the host and some of the stars (NRSV) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NRSV, ESV, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">These notes take the view that the stars and the heavenly host are closely associated. In your translation it is good to mention them separately but indicate their close association. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some of heaven’s army, some of the stars</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and trampled them:</strong> A horn, of course, normally has no feet and cannot literally trample on something. But this horn forced the stars to submit to it, and humiliated them so that they were considered of no value or worth. In some languages it may be impossible to say that a horn <em>trampled</em> the stars. It may be necessary to say something more general like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>crushed them</p></blockquote>",

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It magnified itself, even up to the Prince of the host (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That little horn set itself up as equal to…the Commander of heaven’s armies (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Prince of the host:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the Prince of the host</em> is more literally “the prince/commander of the army/host.” Here the reference may be to God himself, the preincarnate Christ, or to his representative.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Goldingay, page 210, Steinmann, page 202–203, and Miller, pages 226–227.</span></span> See how you translated this in Joshua 5:14.

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>stopped the daily sacrifices offered to him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>canceling the daily sacrifices offered to him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it took the daily burnt offering from him (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His daily sacrifice:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>His daily sacrifice</em> is literally “the perpetual.” This word refers to the offerings that the priests offered daily to God in the temple at Jerusalem.</p><h4>8:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and overthrew the place of His sanctuary.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and God’s sanctuary was ruined.</p></li><li><p>and caused people to abandon the holy place where they worshiped God.</p></li><li><p>and caused people to desert the temple.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and overthrew the place of His sanctuary:</strong> The pronoun <em>His</em> here means “the LORD’s.” The <em>sanctuary</em> of the LORD is his holy place, his temple. This is a reference to the time when Antiochus Epiphanes, symbolized by the little horn, set up an idol in God’s temple (167 B.C.). The temple was thus profaned or defiled. It is good to use a word that can refer to the violation of a holy place rather than just to its physical destruction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and his sanctuary was ruined/devastated</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause.

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn.

Some scholars have suggested that the present Hebrew text, the MT, is incorrect, but there is no agreement as to the exact correct reading. English translations therefore translate it in various ways. It is recommended that you follow the understanding of the BSB and similar versions such as the NET and RSV/NRSV:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because of wickedness, the host was given over to it together with the regular burnt offering (NRSV</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The army was given over, along with the daily sacrifice, in the course of his sinful rebellion. (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>8:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And in the rebellion, the host and the daily sacrifice were given over to the horn,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In/By wickedness the little horn obtained power over the host/army and over the daily burnt offerings.</p></li><li><p>The little horn gained <span data-bnType=\"implied\">power over</span> God’s army and over the daily sacrifice through an evil deed.</p></li><li><p>The little horn took wrongful/unlawful control over God’s people and over the daily burnt offerings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And in the rebellion:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>And in the rebellion</em> is literally “in transgression.” There are at least two ways to understand this phrase in this context:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>it indicates that the little horn sinned. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the course of his sinful rebellion (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>it indicates that God’s people sinned. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People sinned there (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(GNT, NIV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to leave this ambiguous in possible. However if it is not possible it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as this is the meaning that the passage is emphasizing. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in an act of rebellion (ESV note)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in a sinful deed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural or necessary to translate the idea of <em>rebellion</em> or “transgression” using a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it rebelled/sinned <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against Yahweh</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the host and the daily sacrifice were given over to the horn:</strong> The Hebrew of this clause is difficult to understand. The Hebrew text includes a preposition before the word translated as <em>the host</em>, and its meaning in this context is not clear. These notes will recommend that the translator follow the understanding of the BSB, NIV, RSV/NRSV, ESV, NASB, and NET. These versions understand the preposition to mean “in addition to” or “together with.” The little horn received power over God’s people (or host/army) as well as over the daily sacrifice. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the host was given over to it together with the regular burnt offering (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the host will be given over to the horn along with the regular sacrifice (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The army was given over, along with the daily sacrifice (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the host:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>the host</em> is the same word that was used in 8:11a. Here it probably refers to the host or multitude of the LORD’s people. The little horn gained power over God’s people; that is, it conquered them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the daily sacrifice:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>the daily sacrifice</em> is “the perpetual,” as in 8:11b. Translate it here as you did there</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>were given over to the horn:</strong> This is an idiom meaning “were put in its power.” This is a passive verb. The context implies that it was God who allowed the little horn to gain power or control over both the host and the daily sacrifice. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as an active clause with the subject made explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God allowed the horn to get/have control/power over his people</p></blockquote><h4>8:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and it flung truth to the ground</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Throwing truth to the ground,</p></li><li><p>It ignored what was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">right and</span> true,</p></li><li><p>The horn rejected/refused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> true <span data-bnType=\"implied\">way/word</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it flung truth to the ground:</strong> The abstract noun <em>truth</em> here refers to what is true, God’s words or message. The little horn did not honor what was true. By flinging it <em>to the ground</em>, he showed that he scorned and wished to dismiss and ignore it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate the verb <em>flung</em>:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and truth was overthrown (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it cast truth to the ground (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and flung truth to the ground (NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the form that is most natural in your language. The reader should understand that the little horn chose to dishonor the truth about God.</p><h4>8:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and prospered in whatever it did.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>it succeeded in all that it did.</p></li><li><p>and so it accomplished/achieved whatever it wanted.</p></li><li><p>and it was very successful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prospered in whatever it did:</strong> The Hebrew text is more literally “it will act and it will succeed.” This indicates that the little horn continued to act in an aggressive way and was successful in its various deeds. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The horn was successful in everything it did (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and kept prospering in what it did (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The horn was active and successful (NJB)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:12b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB follows the Hebrew order. Some English versions reverse this order by placing the information in 8:12c before that in 8:12b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>It prospered in everything it did, <sup>12b</sup>and truth was thrown to the ground. (NIV)</p></blockquote></div>",

The angel was asking about the end or completion of <u>the events described</u> in the vision, not the vision itself. He was asking how long the evil power symbolized by the little horn would be successful. In order to avoid the wrong meaning, that the question was about the length of the actual vision, it may be necessary to supply some information.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>perpetual sacrifice (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the regular burnt offering (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to make it clear that the vision concerned the suspension or absence of the daily sacrifices.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the surrender of the holy place (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how long…will enemies control the holy place</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and of the host to be trampled:</strong> God’s people were trampled; that is, they were crushed and oppressed.

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn. That little horn grew as high as the stars, as high as the army of heaven, and as high as the commander of the army. When it was at its highest, it stopped the daily sacrifices and desecrated the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel Gabriel came to Daniel and explained the meaning of what he had seen. The ram and the goat represented kings and their kingdoms. The little horn represented a particularly wicked king. That king would even defy God, but in the end that wicked king would be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions have two headings within this section. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NET Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NRSV Vision of a Ram and a Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Gabriel Interprets the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Angel Gabriel Explains the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">BFrCL88 Second vision: the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation of the second vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GeCL97 A second vision: The battle between the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the vision of the ram and the goat (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are a number of similarities between chapter eight and chapter seven. For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way. Even Daniel did not understand the full meaning of what he saw.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027008013\" data-endVerseId=\"1027008014\"><h3>Paragraph 8:13–14</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">God’s angel indicated that the evil deeds of the little horn will be limited to a certain time period.</p></div><h4>8:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He said to me, “It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I heard him answer, “It will continue for 2,300 evenings and mornings.</p></li><li><p>The angel replied, “It will last for two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">During that time there will be no daily sacrifices</span>.</p></li><li><p>This was the reply: “For <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a total of</span> two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He said to me:</strong> There is a textual problem here. The Hebrew text reads <em>to me</em>, but other ancient versions have “to him,” that is, to the other angel. The two possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the original text read <em>to me</em>: <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, ESV, NET, GW, NCV, NIV)</em></p></li><li><p>the original text read “to him.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And he said to him (RSV) <em>(RSV/NRSV, NJB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the MT and option (1), as the BSB has done. The REB leaves it ambiguous by saying “the answer came.” The GNT says, “I heard the other angel answer,” and the CEV says, “The other answered.” It is also possible to say;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I heard the angel reply</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>2,300 evenings and mornings</em> is more literally “evening, morning, two thousand and three hundred.” There are two ways to understand this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>it refers to a period of 1,150 days, or about three and a half years. A total of 2,300 sacrifices would be omitted or cancelled. See 7:25.</p></li><li><p>it refers to a period of 2,300 days, a little over six years and three months. 2,300 morning sacrifices would be omitted or cancelled, and 2,300 evening sacrifices as well.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This probably refers to the events described in the book of 1 Maccabees 4:52–52, which took place in 167–164 B.C. Antiochus banned sacrifices and desecrated the altar of the LORD in 167 B.C. Judas Maccabeus consecrated the altar and again offered sacrifices upon it in 164 BC.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other possible ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It will take <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a total of</span> 2,300 evenings and mornings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this will happen for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a total of</span> 2,300 hundred times—both evening and morning <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sacrifices</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be canceled</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Evenings, mornings, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a sum of</span> 2,300 will pass before…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This will continue for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a total of</span> 2300 evenings and mornings</p></blockquote><h4>8:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>then the sanctuary will be properly restored.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then the temple will be made acceptable to God again.”</p></li><li><p>then they (indefinite) will restore the temple.”</p></li><li><p>After that, the priests will restore and reconsecrate the temple.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then the sanctuary will be properly restored:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>properly restored</em> means “put right.” This is a passive clause. It indicates that God’s people will restore God’s sanctuary, the temple, and make it fit for worship again. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then the Temple will be made right again (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the Temple will be restored. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the holy place will be repaired. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use an active verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I heard a man calling from the Ulai</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a man:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>a man</em> is “adam,” that is, a member of the human race, a person. It is not the same as the word in 8:15c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from between the banks of the Ulai:</strong> The <em>Ulai</em> was a canal. See how you referred to it in 8:2. The Hebrew here is more literally “between the Ulai.” The exact meaning of this is unclear. Possibly it indicates that Daniel heard someone’s voice coming from near the canal.

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn. That little horn grew as high as the stars, as high as the army of heaven, and as high as the commander of the army. When it was at its highest, it stopped the daily sacrifices and desecrated the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel Gabriel came to Daniel and explained the meaning of what he had seen. The ram and the goat represented kings and their kingdoms. The little horn represented a particularly wicked king. That king would even defy God, but in the end that wicked king would be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions have two headings within this section. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NET Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NRSV Vision of a Ram and a Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Gabriel Interprets the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Angel Gabriel Explains the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">BFrCL88 Second vision: the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation of the second vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GeCL97 A second vision: The battle between the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the vision of the ram and the goat (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are a number of similarities between chapter eight and chapter seven. For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way. Even Daniel did not understand the full meaning of what he saw.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027008017\" data-endVerseId=\"1027008019\"><h3>Paragraph 8:17–19</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph introduces Gabriel’s explanation of Daniel’s vision.</p></div><h4>8:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As he came near to where I stood,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then Gabriel came to the place where I was standing.</p></li><li><p>So he/Gabriel approached me,</p></li><li><p>When he/Gabriel came near,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As he came near to where I stood:</strong> The pronoun <em>he</em> here refers to Gabriel. In some languages it will be necessary to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Gabriel came to where I was standing.

Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was so terrified that I fell to the ground (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was very afraid and bowed facedown on the ground. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Struck by fear/awe, I knelt down on the ground</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fell facedown:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>fell facedown</em> is literally “and I fell on my face.” However, Daniel did not fall accidentally and hit his face. He quickly lowered himself and put his face on the ground because he was awed and afraid. Express this idea in a way that is natural in your language. See how you translated this in Daniel 2:46. 5/</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:17a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a logical connection between the verbs in these verse parts: Gabriel came near, and that caused Daniel to be afraid. Because of his fear, he fell prostrate on the ground. Show these connections in a way that is natural in your languages. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Gabriel came over, and I fell to the ground in fear. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So he approached the place where I was standing. As he came, I felt terrified and fell flat on the ground.

Place these words where it is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He said to me, “Son of man, understand that the vision is about the end times” (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Son of man:</strong> The Hebrew says “son of adam.” This way of addressing Daniel emphasizes his humanity. Here are some other ways to translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Human being (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>child of mankind</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>understand that the vision concerns the time of the end:</strong> Gabriel wanted Daniel to know that what he had seen would be fulfilled not immediately but in the end time. However, he did not indicate to what <em>end</em> this refers. It is best to leave this open. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>understand that this vision is about the time of the end (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you must understand that the events you have seen in your vision relate to the time of the end (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Understand…that the vision points to the time of the end (REB)</p></blockquote>",

This future time is called the <em>time of wrath</em>. This phrase refers to the time when God will be angry and punish his enemies. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen, and I will tell you what will take place later in the period of wrath (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will tell you what will happen in the last days, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the time of God’s</span> anger (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Behold, I will make known to you:</strong> The Hebrew text introduces this verb phrase with an exclamation that is often translates as <em>Behold</em>. Here it calls attention to what Gabriel is about to say.

Some English versions do not say <em>it</em>, but say “the vision.” These words are not included explicitly in the MT but is supplied by many English versions and the Septuagint (LXX). You may include it if it is natural in your language. If it is not necessary, you may wish to follow one of these models:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it refers to the appointed time of the end (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the end time has been determined (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the appointed time of the end:</strong> The Hebrew noun that the BSB translates as <em>appointed time</em> refers in a general way to a set time, such as for a meeting or feast. Here the emphasis is on the fact that God has set a time for the ending of the events in the vision. The suffering and oppression will not last forever. God has appointed a time limit. See how you translated the <em>time of the end</em> in 8:17c. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>at a set moment an end will come</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>it will end in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> time</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:19a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to combine the information in these verse parts.

He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn.

The large or great horn on the goat was broken off, and four other horns grew up in its place. In your translation, try to use the same words and phrases as in 8:8. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four other arose (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The four horns that came up when the first horn was broken (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">first</span> horn broke off, and four horns replaced it.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the broken one:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB literally translates as <em>the broken one</em> refers to the horn that was broken off suddenly (8:8). In some languages it will be natural to make it explicit that this refers to a broken horn For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the first horn was broken (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>After this horn is broken (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>8:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>represent four kingdoms that will rise from that nation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>four kingdoms shall arise/appear from that/one nation.</p></li><li><p>This indicates that four kingdoms will come out of one nation.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">represent</span> four kingdoms that will come from that/his nation.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>represent four kingdoms that will rise from that nation:</strong> The BSB has again supplied the verb <em>represent</em>, which is not in the Hebrew text. The four horns in the vision represented or symbolized four kingdoms. The vision indicated that four kingdoms would come from the nation represented or symbolized by the one horn. Or, in other words, the one kingdom would divide into four. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>four other kingdoms will appear (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>four kingdoms shall arise from his nation (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>into which that nation will be divided (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that nation:</strong> The Hebrew text says “a nation,” but the Septuagint (LXX) and other ancient translations say “his nation.” The reference is to the nation that the broken horn symbolized. In your translation, you should make it clear that the phrase <em>that nation</em> refers to the nation represented by the broken horn.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 8:22a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Hebrew text mentions the broken horn before the horns that arose in his/its place. There are various ways to arrange or organize the information in these verse parts. Here are some examples of translations that follow the Hebrew order:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for the horn which was broken off and replaced by four other horns: four kingdoms will rise out of that nation (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Use the order that is most natural in your language.</p></div><h4>8:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but will not have the same power.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However they will not have as much power as the first nation.</p></li><li><p>But they will not be as strong/great as it was.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but will not have the same power:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>but will not have the same power</em> is more literally “but not with his power” (see the RSV). These four nations will all be weaker than the first nation, the Greek empire. None of them will be as strong as that first nation. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and which will not be as strong as the first kingdom (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but none as great as the first (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but they will lack its power (REB)</p></blockquote>",

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a fierce king, a master of intrigue, will rise to power (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>insolent:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>insolent</em> is more literally “strong of face” or “stern-faced.” It is implied that the fierce or stern look on his face showed his character. That is, it showed that he was a hard-hearted or cruel man. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a fierce king (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a bold and cruel king (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dangerous (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>skilled in intrigue:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>skilled in intrigue</em> is more literally “understanding riddles.” In this context it implies that he will be clever in an evil way.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>an evil genius<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>UBS Handbook, page 224.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will come to the throne:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>will come to the throne</em> here means “will rise to power” or “will become powerful.” This evil man will become a powerful king.</p>",

For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way.

These are the days in which no sacrifices would be offered to God on his altar in Jerusalem (8:11b). Neither in the evening or in the morning would people be able to bring their sacrifices to the temple. You may need to make some information explicit in your translation.

He described another vision, this one occurring during the third year of Belshazzar’s reign over Babylon. In this vision Daniel was by the bank of a canal near the city of Susa. He saw a very powerful ram with two horns that charged in all directions. Next he saw a goat with one large horn between its eyes. The goat attacked and defeated the ram and grew very powerful. Its large horn broke and four prominent horns grew in its place. From one of those four horns grew a small horn. That little horn grew as high as the stars, as high as the army of heaven, and as high as the commander of the army. When it was at its highest, it stopped the daily sacrifices and desecrated the temple.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The angel Gabriel came to Daniel and explained the meaning of what he had seen. The ram and the goat represented kings and their kingdoms. The little horn represented a particularly wicked king. That king would even defy God, but in the end that wicked king would be destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions have two headings within this section. For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NET Daniel Has a Vision of a Goat and a Ram (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">An Angel Interprets Daniel’s Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">NRSV Vision of a Ram and a Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Gabriel Interprets the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT Daniel’s Vision of a Ram and a Goat</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Angel Gabriel Explains the Vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">BFrCL88 Second vision: the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Interpretation of the second vision (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GeCL97 A second vision: The battle between the Ram and the Goat (8:1)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The meaning of the vision of the ram and the goat (8:15)</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are a number of similarities between chapter eight and chapter seven. For example, both chapters use symbolic language to describe kingdoms, and both use the symbol of a horn to refer to particular rulers of those kingdoms. In spite of these similarities, it is important to understand that the symbols in the two chapters do not necessarily refer to the same things. For example, while there are similarities between the two little horns, there are also important differences. The Notes will explain some of these differences. The Notes will also suggest ways to translate these symbols.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">As noted above, the chapter is divided into two parts, one that describes the vision and one that gives the interpretation of the vision. Both parts lead to a climax. In the first part the horn grew until it became so great that it succeeded in everything it did (8:12). A similar sequence of events occurs in the second part of the vision. Gabriel described the growth of the horn and its climactic success (8:24–26). At the end of the chapter, Gabriel announced that God would destroy the horn (8:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The vision includes a number of images that may seem obscure and confusing. It is usually best to translate these images in a literal way. Even Daniel did not understand the full meaning of what he saw.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027008027\" data-endVerseId=\"1027008027\"><h3>Paragraph 8:27</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This section concludes with Daniel’s response to Gabriel’s explanation of the meaning of the vision.</p></div><h4>8:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for days.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Then I, Daniel, became exhausted and lay <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in bed</span> sick for days.</p></li><li><p>¶ When the vision ended, I was exhausted and sick for several days.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I, Daniel, was exhausted:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>was exhausted</em> can mean “finished, exhausted.” The exact meaning here is uncertain.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lay ill for days:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>lay ill</em> can mean “weak,” “sick,” or “faint.” You may wish to follow the national language version here and translate a similar idea. Some English versions supply the word “several,” but the Hebrew just says <em>days</em>. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lay sick for some days (RSV/NRSV)</p></blockquote><h4>8:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"8:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then I got up and went about the king’s business.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then I got up and began to do my regular work for the king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When I felt better,</span> I got out of bed and went <span data-bnType=\"implied\">back</span> to work for the king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then I got up and went about the king’s business:</strong> The implied information here is that Daniel was recovered, at least physically. He was able to rise from his bed and go back to work.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Then I got up:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>I got up</em> is often used to emphasize the beginning of an action. It does not always indicate that the subject had been lying or sitting down. In this context it refers to recovery from illness, and so, it does imply that Daniel had been lying in bed. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I got up again (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and went about the king’s business:</strong> The Hebrew is more literally “and I did the work of the king.” Daniel went back to his duties, to the work that the king had told him to do.

The book of Jeremiah was one of these. Refer to these books in a way that is natural in your language. However, your translation should not indicate that these were printed and bound books such as we have today.

It is written in the Hebrew Scriptures as four consonantal letters (YHWH), the Tetragrammaton, and the vowels originally attached to these letters are not certain. The Name was always read aloud as the Hebrew word meaning “the Lord.” These Notes represent the Name with the English form Yahweh, as does the NJB.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jeremiah the prophet:</strong> An Old Testament <em>prophet</em> was a man sent from God to give a message to the people of Israel.

The prayer and petition are not separate actions.

He fasted and he wore sackcloth and sprinkled ashes on himself. These actions all indicated sorrow and repentance. In some languages it may be natural to translate one or more of the nouns with verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and fasted in sackcloth and ashes (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I fasted. I wore sackcloth and put ashes on my head.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with fasting:</strong> The phrase <em>with fasting</em> indicates that Daniel chose not to eat in order to show his grief and sincere repentance.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I refused to eat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to show my sorrow</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sackcloth:</strong> The phrase <em>sackcloth</em> indicates that Daniel wore clothing made from rough cloth as a sign of his sincere mourning and repentance.

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I also wore rough burlap (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and ashes:</strong> The phrase <em>and ashes</em> is short for “and in ashes.” This indicates that Daniel sat in ashes or put ashes on himself, probably on his head, to show his sorrow and sincerity. See how you translated this in Jeremiah 6:26 and Luke 10:13 and the examples above. The NLT says;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and sprinkled myself with ashes</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 9:3b-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">It is probable that Daniel put on sackcloth and ashes and began to fast before he began to pray. In some languages it may therefore be natural to reorder the action recorded in these verse parts.

The confession was the content of the prayer. The sins that Daniel confessed were the common sins of the people of Israel. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I prayed to Yahweh my God.

The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>awesome</em> describes God as so great and holy that he is worthy of fear and respect. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O Lord, you are a great and awesome God! (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our Lord, you are a great and fearsome God (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is important to avoid implying that there are many gods and that the Lord is one of the great and awesome ones. In some languages it may be necessary to avoid this wrong meaning by translating this phrase as one or two separate clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Lord God, you are great, and we honor you.

They are not two separate things that God kept. Rather, God showed his love for his people by remaining faithful to the covenant that he had made with them. God’s covenant promise was to be loving and faithful to his people, and he had kept that promise.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are faithful to your covenant and show constant love (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you keep the covenant and show faithful love (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are faithful to your covenant.

In your translation, be sure to make it clear that this refers to one group of people with two characteristics, and not to two different groups.

They had acted like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband or a man who betrays his king. They had not kept the covenant that God had made with them, and they had worshiped other gods.

Daniel confessed that the people of Israel in general had broken the laws that God had given them. He himself was one of the people of Israel, and in some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We,</span> the people of Israel, have all broken/disobeyed your law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>transgressed:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>transgressed</em> means to cross a boundary. In this context it refers to disobeying the Torah, the book of instructions and laws that God gave Moses for Israel. Use the expression that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All Israel has broken your law (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Everyone in Israel has disobeyed your law!</p></blockquote><h4>9:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and turned away, refusing to obey Your voice;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and turned away from it/you. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(excl)</sup> have refused to obey you.</p></li><li><p>They/We have ignored them. They/We have refused to do as you instructed them/us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and turned away:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates literally as <em>turned away</em> means to turn from something in order to ignore it. See the Notes on 9:5c and how you translated it there. In some languages it may be natural to supply an object and indicate explicitly from what the people had turned away. The object is the same as in 9:11a, the law or instruction of God. The implied subject of the verb is the whole people of Israel, which included Daniel himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span> <sup>(excl)</sup> have turned away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from your</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">law/instruction</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>refusing to obey Your voice:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>refusing to obey Your voice</em> is more literally “not listening to your voice.” This is another way of describing the same action as “turned away.” Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not listening to you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>unwilling to listen to your voice (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They have not paid any attention to what you say/command.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We have refused to listen to you.</p></blockquote><h4>9:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so the oath and the curse written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil things</span> have come/fallen upon us, the curses and oaths that are written in the Law of Moses the servant of God,</p></li><li><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(sing)</sup> have brought upon us the solemn curses in Moses’ Law/Instruction book.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so:</strong> The common Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>so</em> here introduces a result clause. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the oath and the curse written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us:</strong> This is a passive clause. The implied actor is God himself. He had caused the people of Israel to suffer from the curses that Moses warned the people about in Deuteronomy 28. There are at least two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the solemn curses and judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured down on us (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have poured out on us the judgment solemnly threatened in the law of Moses the servant of God (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you brought on us the curses that are written in the Law of Moses, your servant (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the oath and the curse:</strong> This phrase is literally “the curse and the oath.” The BSB has reversed the order of these two words. Together, they form one idea that refers to the judgments that God warned about in Deuteronomy 28.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>written in the Law of Moses the servant of God:</strong> The verb <em>written</em> is passive in form. Moses was the author of the law in the sense that he gave the people the law from God. He may or may not have written it personally, and this is not in focus here. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that the law of Moses the servant of God describes</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>about which the law of Moses the servant of God warns</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the book of the law of God’s servant Moses</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Law of Moses:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>Law</em> is “torah,” that is, instruction. In this context it refers to the written Law or Torah of the Hebrew Old Testament, and specifically the book of Deuteronomy. This law was <em>of Moses</em> in the sense that Moses gave it to the people from God. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the law that Moses gave us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the Teachings of Moses (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>9:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because we have sinned against You.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for we<sup>(excl)</sup> have sinned against you.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You have done this to us</span> because we sinned against you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because we have sinned against You:</strong> This is a reason clause.

He recognized that the people of Israel did not deserve God’s help, but he asked for forgiveness on the ground of God’s own nature and mercy.</p></div><h4>9:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of Your servant.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “Now please listen to me, your servant. Please listen to my requests.</p></li><li><p>¶ “O God, our God, I am your servant. Please listen to me when I pray to you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So now:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>So now</em> is a transition phrase that here introduces a logical conclusion to Daniel’s prayer. In this context it is not a time word. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our God, hear the prayers and petitions of Your servant:</strong> Daniel asked God to hear his prayer. He used the phrase <em>Your servant</em> to refer to himself in a humble way. In some languages it may be natural or necessary to use a first-person pronoun;</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O God, hear my prayer and pleading (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our God:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>our God</em> is a vocative form, a form of address. See the General Comment at the end on 9:17b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prayers and petitions:</strong> The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as <em>prayers</em> and <em>petitions</em> here both refer to Daniel’s prayer to God. In this context they are near synonyms.</p><h4>9:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Lord, for your own sake look with kindness at the ruins of your holy place.</p></li><li><p>For the sake of your own name/glory, be kind to your ruined temple.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary:</strong> The Hebrew idiom that the BSB literally translates as <em>cause Your face to shine upon</em> is an idiom that means to look kindly on someone and therefore to treat them kindly. Use an expression that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>look favorably on your holy place, which is lying in ruins (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>show favor to your devastated sanctuary for your own sake (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do good things for your holy place that is in ruins (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O Lord:</strong> This is a form of address. In some languages it may not be natural to have a form of address that is different from the form of address in the previous sentence (9:17a has “God”). See the General Comment on 9:17a, b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>upon Your desolate sanctuary:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>desolate</em> means “deserted, ruined.” The sanctuary had been heavily damaged by the Babylonian army and now lay empty. It was not fit for its purpose, and no one was using it to worship God.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 9:17a, b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse Daniel addresses Yahweh as “God” in 17a and as “Lord” in 17b. In some languages this may be unnatural or may give the wrong meaning that he was talking to more than one deity. In those languages it may be best to combine the forms of address or just use one. Place this form of address where it is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So now, our God, accept the prayer and requests of your servant, and show favor to our devastated sanctuary for your own sake. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>O God, hear my prayer and pleading. Restore your Temple, which has been destroyed; restore it so that everyone will know that you are God. (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

The repetition is for emphasis. In some languages it may be natural to combine them into one, perhaps supplying an object, as the GNT has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen to us, O God (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>9:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>open Your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears Your name.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Look <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at us</span>!

The two phrases “our desolation” and <em>the city that bears Your name</em> together refer to the desolation of the city of Jerusalem. The BSB has therefore combined the two phrases into one, <em>the desolation of the city that bears Your name</em>. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look down and see the ruins of the city that bears your Name.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Look and see how the city that bears your Name lies desolate/ruined!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>open Your eyes and see:</strong> The two expressions <em>open Your eyes</em> and <em>see</em> together are a request to God to pay attention to the suffering of Jerusalem. Daniel knew that God could already see the city, but he wanted him to pay attention to it. In some languages it may be natural to use only one verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>please look at</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>please consider</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the desolation of the city:</strong> This phrase refers to the ruins of the city of Jerusalem. In some languages it may be natural to translate it using a verb form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the city that has been ruined</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the city that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our enemies</span> have devastated</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>that bears Your name:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>that bears Your name</em> is literally “over which your name is called.” This implies that God is the owner of Jerusalem. See also the note on 2 Samuel 12:28d-e.</p><h4>9:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For we are not presenting our petitions before You because of our righteous acts,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is not because we<sup>(excl)</sup> are righteous that we make this request.</p></li><li><p>It is not because of any merit of our own that we ask this.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For we are not presenting our petitions before You because of our righteous acts:</strong> Daniel did not expect God to listen to his prayer because the people of Israel were righteous. As he had just confessed, they were not. So their good deeds or good lives were not the reason why he hoped that God would listen to his requests. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For it is not because of our own righteous deeds that we are praying to you (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We do not present our supplication before you on the ground of our righteousness (NRSV)</p></blockquote><h4>9:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but because of Your great compassion.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is because of your great mercy.</p></li><li><p>We ask it because you are merciful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but because of Your great compassion:</strong> This is a short way of saying “but we make these requests of you because of your great compassion.” Daniel implied that he hoped that God would answer his requests because God was compassionate.

Scholars do not agree as to how or when the words of Gabriel were or will be fulfilled. It is therefore important to translate the text as it stands, without attempting to explain any past or future fulfillment. It is probable that the prophecies were (or will be) fulfilled in more than one way and at more than one time. Antiochus Epiphanes defiled the temple in 167 BC, and Jesus saw the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army in AD 70 as another fulfillment (see Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14). Daniel’s words may also have reference to the end times. It is therefore recommended that the translator use vocabulary that permits multiple fulfillments. The translator should not include notes that allow for only one way of understanding Gabriel’s words.</p></div><h4>9:24a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “Seventy weeks have been decided for your people and your holy city</p></li><li><p>¶ “Seven times seventy years is the length of time God has set for freeing your people and your holy city.

The implied actor is God. God had decided that something should happen for seventy “sevens.” There are two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Seventy weeks are decreed (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Seventy weeks have been determined (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a period of seventy sets of seven had been decreed (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb, with the subject supplied. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Seven times seventy years is the length of time God has set (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has decided that seventy weeks <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of years</span> must pass</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Seventy weeks:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>weeks</em> is literally “sevens.” This word is normally used of a literal week, a period of seven days. Most scholars believe that here, as in Jeremiah 25:11–12, the reference is to a period of years. Jeremiah spoke of 70 years, and Daniel of 70 weeks of years, that is, 70 x 7 or 490 years. Some English translations make this explicit. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Seven times seventy years (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It will probably be necessary to write a footnote here, explaining that the Hebrew is literally “sevens” and that “sevens” is a way to refer to the seven-day week.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some scholars believe this to be a symbolic period of time. Others believe that this is a way of referring to a period of 490 years. However, scholars do not agree as to which 490 years this is a reference.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for your people and your holy city:</strong> The phrase <em>your people</em> refers to the people of Israel and <em>your holy city</em> to the city of Jerusalem.</p><h4>9:24b–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">These three verse parts speak of transgression, sin, and wickedness. These three words are close in meaning. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as “transgression” means “rebellion, revolt.” The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as “sin” refers to an act that is morally wrong and the guilt that results from it. The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as “wickedness” can also refer to both sin and guilt.</p><h4>9:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to stop their transgression,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to end <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> rebellion</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">During this time</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> will put an end to rebellion</p></li><li><p>This is to stop them from turning against God/him,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to stop their transgression:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>transgression</em> refers to rebelling against authority. The Hebrew word is literally “the transgression” and may refer specifically to Israel’s rebellion against God. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for putting an end to transgression (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to put an end to rebellion (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to finish their rebellion (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>9:24c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to put an end to sin,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to bring sin to an end,</p></li><li><p>and sin.</p></li><li><p>and to bring an end to sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to put an end to sin:</strong> There is a textual problem with the Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>to put an end to</em>. The written form of the consonantal text reads “to seal up,” but the traditional form to be read aloud is “to finish.” The two possibilities are:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The original Hebrew verb meant “to complete, finish.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to make an end of sin (NASB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, NLT, KJV, NASB, RSV/NRSV, ESV, REB)</em></p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The original Hebrew verb meant “to seal up.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for placing the seal on sin (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the traditional spoken form of the Hebrew text.</p><h4>9:24d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to make atonement for iniquity,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to atone for iniquity, (NET)</p></li><li><p>He will atone for their guilt,</p></li><li><p>He will make compensation/amends for sin/evil</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to make atonement for iniquity:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>make atonement</em> basically means “to ransom, give a gift to secure favor.” It is used frequently in Leviticus for the action of the priest in offering a sacrifice to obtain forgiveness for sin. This sacrifice was understood as compensation offered to God for the sin of the one who offered it. Some other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to atone for their guilt (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to reconcile wicked people to himself</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to compensate for wickedness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to supply a subject and say who would <em>make atonement for iniquity</em>. God himself would atone for the wicked things that people had done. He would compensate for their sin by himself giving as an offering to cover their sin and so reconcile God with man.</p><h4>9:24e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to bring in everlasting righteousness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to bring in justice that will last forever,</p></li><li><p>bring in eternal justice,</p></li><li><p>and then he will judge rightly/justly forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to bring in everlasting righteousness:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> is the common word that refers to what is right and good, justice. It is implied that God is the one who will bring in eternal justice, and that he will do so on earth and for his people. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to bring in goodness that continues forever (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for introducing everlasting righteousness (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and justice will rule forever (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to supply a subject and indicate that God is the one who will bring in everlasting righteousness:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will bring in eternal goodness/justice</p></blockquote><h4>9:24f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:24f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to seal up vision and prophecy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to confirm visions and prophecies,</p></li><li><p>ratify/verify vision and prophecy,</p></li><li><p>He will fulfill <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> vision and prophecy</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to seal up vision and prophecy:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>to seal up</em> is a metaphor. In Daniel’s time, people sealed their letters or other documents with a wax seal that had an identifying mark. This seal confirmed the identity of the sender and showed that the letter or document was genuine. In this context this is figurative language meaning “to confirm, to show something to be true/genuine.” There are several ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>keeping the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to seal both vision and prophet (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>translating the meaning of the metaphor.

Many recent scholars consider that this refers to the temple in Jerusalem. The anointing would then refer to the ceremony by which the temple sanctuary was restored and rededicated after it was defiled. See the note on 8:14. But it was more common for priests and kings to be anointed and so appointed to God’s service. It is therefore good to consider that this may refer to the anointing of a man set apart for God, the Messiah, who would be the priest of the new covenant and the new temple. This is the traditional Christian understanding.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See the discussion by Andrew Steinmann, Concordia Commentary, <em>Daniel</em>, pages 465–468.</span></span> Try to translate in such a way that this phrase can refer to either a holy place or a holy man, the anointed Messiah. It is hard to do this in English, but in some languages it may be possible. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to anoint a most holy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">one</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that the holy of holies will be anointed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>anoint:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>anoint</em> refers to pouring a little oil on someone or something in order to appoint them to a specific service for God. See how you translated this in 1 Samuel 2:10, 9:16, 1 Kings 1:34, and Psalm 23:5.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Most Holy Place:</strong> As mentioned above, the English word <em>Place</em> has been supplied by the BSB. If possible, avoid using a word that can only refer to a physical place. You may wish to insert a footnote saying something like: “The Hebrew phrase can refer to a person who is holy to God (the Messiah), or to a building (the temple). This prophecy may include both ideas.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Most Holy:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>Holy</em> means to be separated and set aside for God, dedicated to God.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 9:24b-g</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These six clauses refer to six things that will happen within the period of the seventy weeks of years. In the BSB, as in the Hebrew, the verbs describing each event are in the infinitive form (“to stop,” “to put an end,” “to make atonement,” “to bring in,” “to seal up,” “to anoint”). In some languages it will be more natural to use finite verbs. These can be in one of two forms:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using active verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will bring rebellion and wickedness to an end. He will atone for sin, and introduce/establish eternal justice. The visions and words of the prophet will come true, and they will anoint the most holy place/one.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the rebellion will be stopped, sin brought to an end, iniquity expiated, everlasting right ushered in, vision and prophecy ratified, and the Most Holy Place anointed.

Thirteen years had therefore passed since Daniel received the vision described in chapter 8. Daniel was now more than eighty years old.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel had read in the book of Jeremiah that God’s people would remain in exile and serve the king of Babylon for seventy years (Jeremiah 25:11). During that time the city of Jerusalem would remain in ruins. However, God had promised to bring his people back to the land of Judah after the seventy years were over (Jeremiah 29:10). Now Daniel realized that the seventy-year period was almost at an end. He prayed for his people and for Jerusalem. In response, God sent the angel Gabriel to reveal what would happen in the future.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027009024\" data-endVerseId=\"1027009027\"><h3>Paragraph 9:24–27</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The interpretation of this paragraph is extremely controversial. Scholars do not agree as to how or when the words of Gabriel were or will be fulfilled. It is therefore important to translate the text as it stands, without attempting to explain any past or future fulfillment. It is probable that the prophecies were (or will be) fulfilled in more than one way and at more than one time. Antiochus Epiphanes defiled the temple in 167 BC, and Jesus saw the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army in AD 70 as another fulfillment (see Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14). Daniel’s words may also have reference to the end times. It is therefore recommended that the translator use vocabulary that permits multiple fulfillments. The translator should not include notes that allow for only one way of understanding Gabriel’s words.</p></div><h4>9:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Know and understand this:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “Learn and understand these things.</p></li><li><p>¶ “So you must understand that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Know and understand this:</strong> In the Hebrew text this verse part is connected to the previous verse part by the common conjunction that is often translated as “and.” In this context it may be natural to follow the NET and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So know and understand (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Know and understand:</strong> These are commands. In some languages it may be more natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I want you to know and understand</p></blockquote><h4>9:25b–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a textual and interpretation problem in these verse parts. It is related to the punctuation of the Hebrew text. Scholars do not agree as to whether the phrases “seven weeks” and “sixty-two weeks” belong together or whether they have reference to separate events. The two main views are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>the phrases “seven sevens” and “sixty-two sevens” belong together and refer to two probably consecutive periods of time. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from the time the command is given to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed prince comes, seven sets of seven time periods and sixty–two sets of seven time periods will pass. Jerusalem will be restored and rebuilt with a city square and a moat during the troubles of those times. (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, GW, CEV, NET, KJV, NASB, NJB, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>the phrase “seven sevens” refers to the events of 9:25a–d and the phrase “sixty-two sevens” refers to the events of 9:25e. For example, the NRSV translates 9:25b–e as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from the time that the word went out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the time on an anointed prince, there shall be seven weeks; and for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with street and moat, but in a troubled time (NRSV) <em>(RSV/NRSV, ESV, REB, GNT)</em> <em>It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is one possible way to calculate the total of 69 “weeks” referred to here: The seven “weeks” (7x7, 49 years) could cover a period of approximately 457–407 BC. This would include the time of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi. During these years the city of Jerusalem and the temple were rebuilt. The end of the sixty-two “weeks” (7x62, 434 years) would be around A.D. 27. This was near the time when Jesus Christ began his ministry.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><h4>9:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>From the issuance of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>There will be a command given to rebuild the city of Jerusalem. From that time</p></li><li><p>from the issuing of the command to rebuild Jerusalem</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>From the issuance of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem:</strong> This verse part gives the beginning point of a time period. Scholars do not agree as to what year or to what event this refers. It is therefore good to translate this in a fairly literal and general way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From the issuing of the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this <em>decree</em> or message as direct speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>From the time there went out this message: “Return and rebuild Jerusalem” (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the issuance of the decree:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>the issuance of the decree</em> refers to the giving or announcing of an order or law. The text does not say who gave this order, and scholars do not agree as to whom this refers. You should avoid making this explicit and translate this in a general way. You may use either a passive or an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the command is given (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a command will come (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to restore and rebuild Jerusalem:</strong> There are two main ways to understand the Hebrew verbs that the BSB translates as <em>restore</em> and <em>rebuild</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They refer to two actions. The first verb, which is literally “to bring back,” refers to the return of the community to Jerusalem and the remaking of the community. The second verb refers to the physical rebuilding of the walls and structures of Jerusalem. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to restore and build Jerusalem (ESV) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, KJV, NASB, RSV/NRSV, NJB, REB, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They refer to one action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to rebuild Jerusalem (NCV) <em>(NCV, GNT, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and if possible use two verbs to indicate the two actions.</p><h4>9:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>until the Messiah, the Prince,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>until the one anointed/appointed to rule comes</p></li><li><p>until the leader whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has chosen arrives,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until the Messiah, the Prince:</strong> This verse part gives the ending point of a time period. The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>until the Messiah, the Prince</em> is more literally “until an anointed one, a ruler.” It does not have a verb. Some English versions supply the verb “comes” (NIV), and this may be natural in some languages. In other languages it may be more natural to supply a noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until a ruler—the Anointed One—<u>comes</u> (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until <u>the coming/time of</u> the Anointed One, the ruler</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the Messiah, the Prince</em> does not have a definite article (<em>the</em>). There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the Messiah, that is, Christ. Many English versions use initial capitals to refer to the Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the coming of the Chosen Leader (CEV) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NJB, NIV, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to another anointed ruler or priest such as Cyrus, Zerubbabel, or Joshua the high priest. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the time of an anointed prince (NRSV) <em>(RSV/NRSV, ESV, REB, NET, GNT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In English versions translators have often used initial capital letters to distinguish titles and names of God and Christ, as the BSB does. It is therefore possible to see which translations are following this interpretation. However, the Hebrew text itself does not have this distinction and does not require this interpretation. Try to translate in such a way that readers can understand Christ to be a possible fulfillment of this prophecy, but that other understandings are also possible. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until an anointed one, a prince, arrives (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until God’s chosen leader comes (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until one who has been appointed/chosen comes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Messiah:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates literally as <em>Messiah</em> means “anointed person.” In ancient Israel it was the custom for a priest to pour a little oil on the head of a priest or king in order to appoint him to a position of leadership. This symbolic act showed that he was chosen and appointed by God. If the word <em>Messiah</em> would not have this meaning in your culture, it would be good to translate the meaning of the action and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the appointed/chosen one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> chosen one</p></blockquote><h4>9:25d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:25d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>there will be a period of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.</p></li><li><p>seven weeks <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of years</span> and 62 weeks <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of years</span> will pass.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks:</strong> This Hebrew phrase is more literally “there will be seven sevens and sixty-two sevens” (as in the NIV). As in 9:24a, the Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>weeks</em> is a symbolic reference to weeks of years, that is, to seven-year periods. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it will be seven weeks and another sixty-two weeks (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there will be a period of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Seven sets/periods of seven years will pass and then sixty-two sets/periods of seven years will pass.</p></blockquote><h4>9:25e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:25e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of distress.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and a trench/moat.

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It will again be built (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They will build Jerusalem again</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>streets:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>streets</em> normally refers to an open place in a city that could be used for a market place or other meeting place. It can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>plaza (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>city square</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a trench:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>trench</em> refers to a deep ditch that can be filled with water.

Thirteen years had therefore passed since Daniel received the vision described in chapter 8. Daniel was now more than eighty years old.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Daniel had read in the book of Jeremiah that God’s people would remain in exile and serve the king of Babylon for seventy years (Jeremiah 25:11). During that time the city of Jerusalem would remain in ruins. However, God had promised to bring his people back to the land of Judah after the seventy years were over (Jeremiah 29:10). Now Daniel realized that the seventy-year period was almost at an end. He prayed for his people and for Jerusalem. In response, God sent the angel Gabriel to reveal what would happen in the future.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1027009024\" data-endVerseId=\"1027009027\"><h3>Paragraph 9:24–27</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">The interpretation of this paragraph is extremely controversial. Scholars do not agree as to how or when the words of Gabriel were or will be fulfilled. It is therefore important to translate the text as it stands, without attempting to explain any past or future fulfillment. It is probable that the prophecies were (or will be) fulfilled in more than one way and at more than one time. Antiochus Epiphanes defiled the temple in 167 BC, and Jesus saw the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army in AD 70 as another fulfillment (see Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14). Daniel’s words may also have reference to the end times. It is therefore recommended that the translator use vocabulary that permits multiple fulfillments. The translator should not include notes that allow for only one way of understanding Gabriel’s words.</p></div><h4>9:27a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The leader will make a strong/binding treaty with many people for one week <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of years</span>.</p></li><li><p>That ruler will make a firm agreement with many people for seven years.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week:</strong> The subject of the clause <em>he will confirm a covenant</em> is not made explicit. It may be God or the Messiah, or it may be the foreign ruler mentioned in 9:26b. It is good to leave this ambiguous, as the BSB has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he will confirm a covenant with many:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>he will confirm a covenant with many</em> indicates that the ruler, or possibly the Messiah, will make a treaty with many people, possibly many groups of people. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will strike a firm alliance with many people (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for one week:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>one week</em> is literally “one seven.” Again, this phrase refers to a week or period of seven years. The text does not indicate when this <em>one week</em> will occur. Presumably this period of time occurs after the end of the sixty-nine weeks and forms the seventieth and last week. The translator should not try to identify this time period with a particular time in history.</p><h4>9:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the middle of that week/time, he will cause sacrifice and offering to stop/end.</p></li><li><p>He will stop the offerings and sacrifices after three and one-half years. (NCV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but in the middle of the week:</strong> The phrase <em>the week</em> here refers to the same time period mentioned in 9:27a. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>halfway through this week (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>after half this time (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when half this time is past (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will put an end to sacrifice and offering:</strong> Many scholars consider that the pronoun <em>he</em> here refers to the foreign ruler. It is recorded that Antiochus Epiphanes had a pig sacrificed on the altar in the temple in Jerusalem in 167 B.C. In this way he desecrated the temple, making it unholy and unfit for the worship of Yahweh. All sacrifices and offerings to Yahweh then stopped. However, other scholars indicate that it could also be said that God or the Messiah chose to put an end to sacrifice and offering.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Steinmann p. 474.</span></span> It is recommended that you leave the subject open or ambiguous, as in 9:27a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew, like the BSB, uses the singular forms <em>sacrifice</em> and <em>offering</em>. Since this refers to sacrifices and offerings in general, in some languages it will be natural to use a plural form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will end all sacrifices and offerings (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will put an end to sacrifices and offerings (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sacrifice:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>sacrifice</em> normally refers to an animal sacrifice burnt on an altar to honor and please Yahweh.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>offering:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>offering</em> normally refers to grain, oil, or wine that worshipers offered to Yahweh.</p><h4>9:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And on the wing of the temple will come the abomination that causes desolation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>On the wing of the temple he will set up an abominable/disgusting thing that desolates/destroys.</p></li><li><p>He will raise up a horrific/repulsive and destructive object.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And on the wing of the temple:</strong> The Hebrew is literally “and on the wing.” The meaning of this is uncertain. It may refer to the top corner of the temple mentioned in Matthew 4:5 (“the pinnacle of the temple”). Or it may refer to the protrusions at the corners of the altar that are sometimes called horns (see 1 Kings 1:50, Psalm 118:27 and Revelation 9:13). You may wish to follow the translation most commonly used in your area. The NRSV says that the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain and suggests the phrase “and in their place” (that is, in place of the usual sacrifices and offerings).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will come the abomination that causes desolation:</strong> In the year 167 BC, the Greek ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes set up a statue of the Greek god Zeus in the temple in Jerusalem.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>You can read about these events in the Book of 1 Maccabees, chapter 1. This can be found in between the Old and New Testaments in a Roman Catholic Bible such as the NJB.</span></span> Again, in the year AD 70, the Roman general Titus, son of the emperor Vespasian, set up an idolatrous sign of Roman power in the second temple.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Jesus referred to this event as a fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy. See Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14. You can read about the historical events in the writings of Josephus.</span></span> Both these events can be understood as fulfilling this prophecy. Some scholars consider that there may still be a further fulfillment to come. It is best to translate literally and not to indicate when the fulfillment may have taken place. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Awful Horror will be placed on the highest point of the Temple (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction will be put there. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the abomination that causes desolation:</strong> This is a slightly different Hebrew phrase from the phrase in 8:13e that the BSB translates as “the rebellion that causes desolation.” Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the appalling abomination (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a revolting/disgusting object that destroys/devastates</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the “Horrible Thing” that causes destruction (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14, Jesus used this phrase to refer to the Roman army and the desecration of the temple that was to take place in AD 70. Therefore, there seem to be multiple fulfillments of this prophecy. In your translation, you should translate the Hebrew text without indicating how the prophecy was fulfilled.</p><h4>9:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"9:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>until the decreed destruction is poured out upon him.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Finally the fate that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> decided will take/overcome the one who destroys.</p></li><li><p>At last <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will pour out on the destroyer the final <span data-bnType=\"implied\">punishment</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he/God</span> planned.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until the decreed destruction is poured out upon him:</strong> The Hebrew text is more literally “until the end that was/is decreed is poured out on the desolator.” This is a passive clause with two passive verbs (<em>decreed destruction</em> and <em>is poured out</em>). There are two ways to translate these verbs:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the fate that is decreed for this defiler is finally poured out on him (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the decreed end is poured out on the one who destroys (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using one or more active verbs. God is the implied subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the one who put it there meets the end which God has prepared for him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the time God has decided to destroy this one who destroys (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the decreed:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>decreed</em> means “decided, determined.” It is implied that God is the actor. He decided or planned destruction of the one who was causing desolation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has decided</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> planned</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>destruction is poured out upon him:</strong> In many languages it will be impossible or meaningless to say that someone’s end is <em>poured out</em> on him. In those languages it may be necessary to translate the meaning, that this person has a violent or sudden death. In many languages that will be expressed in idiomatic language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he meets his doom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his fate comes upon him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>him:</strong> The pronoun <em>him</em> here refers to the one who places the abomination in the temple. The Hebrew text says “the desolator,” that is, the destroyer. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the one who destroys (NET)</p></blockquote>",

Daniel did not eat food like that. He ate only plain, simple food. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All that time I had eaten no rich food.

This clause explains and expands on the previous clause. Specifically, Daniel did not eat any meat or wine. Use an expression that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no meat or wine had entered my mouth (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no meat or wine passed my lips (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No meat or wine crossed my lips (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I did not eat any…meat, or drink any wine (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>10:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I did not anoint myself with oil until the three weeks were completed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For three weeks I had not anointed myself with oil.</p></li><li><p>Until the three weeks were over, I did not pour/rub any perfumed ointment <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on my body/skin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I did not anoint myself with oil:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>I did not anoint myself with oil</em> is more literally “anointing I did not anoint myself.” The repetition of the verb <em>anoint</em> emphasizes the statement. It was the custom to anoint oneself, that is, apply oil to the skin, for comfort and an attractive appearance. Daniel did not do this. This was another way in which he showed that he was mourning. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nor did I anoint myself with oil until the end of those three weeks (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>or use any perfumed oil for three weeks (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I put no olive oil on my face or hair (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>oil:</strong> The Hebrew text does not indicate what Daniel did not apply to his skin.

The appearance of the man by the river is compared to four very bright things, and his voice is compared to the sound of a large crowd. The point of comparison is that the man’s appearance was very impressive or awe-inspiring and his voice was very loud. In your translation, use vocabulary and imagery that indicate the man was impressive rather than strange or ridiculous. In some languages it may be natural to include the points of similarity. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His body glowed like topaz, his face shone like lightning, his eyes flamed like torches, his arms and feet glittered like burnished bronze, and when he spoke his voice sounded like the voice of a multitude. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His body looked like a precious gem. His face flashed like lightning, and his eyes flamed like torches. His arms and feet shone like polished bronze, and his voice roared like a vast multitude of people. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His body was like shiny yellow quartz.

It indicates that the man’s body was bright and radiant like a beautiful gem. The exact gem that is referred to is not certain. The gem <em>beryl</em> is the same as chrysolite, which is how the translators of the LXX (Septuagint) understood it (see also the NIV). Other possibilities are yellow quartz (NCV) and yellow jasper (NET).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the name of this gemstone in Exodus 28:20a (first gem) and Ezekiel 1:16. Chrysolite is mentioned in Revelation 21:20 (seventh foundation).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If these gemstones are not known in your culture, you may wish to translate using a more general phrase, as the CEV has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His body was like a precious stone.

The point of similarity is that his eyes were brilliant or very bright. They blazed or sparkled like torches. Try to find a word expressing this comparison that is natural in your language for referring to eyes. In some languages it may be natural to supply a verb and translate this simile as a separate clause or sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his eyes <u>were</u> like fiery torches (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his eyes <u>were</u> like blazing torches (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his eyes <u>blazed</u> like flaming torches</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>flaming torches:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>flaming torches</em> is “torches of fire.” It refers to torches that were lit and burning. The light came from cloth attached to a long pole, dipped in oil, and set on fire. In Old Testament times these torches were used to give light when people were walking in the dark. See how you translated the phrase “torch of fire” in Genesis 15:17.</p><h4>10:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>his arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and his arms and legs gleamed like polished bronze.</p></li><li><p>His arms and legs were as bright/shiny as copper when they polish it.</p></li><li><p>His arms and feet had the shine of a highly polished metal.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to supply a verb and translate this simile as a separate clause or sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his arms and feet <u>glittered</u> like burnished bronze (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his arms and his face <u>had</u> the gleam of burnished bronze (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>legs:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>legs</em> more normally refers to feet. In this context either is acceptable. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>feet (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>polished bronze:</strong> The substance called <em>bronze</em> is an alloy (mixture) of copper and tin. The word <em>polished</em> means “burnished,” that is, rubbed to make it bright and shiny. See Revelation 1:15.</p><h4>10:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and his voice like the sound of a multitude.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>His voice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sounded</span> like the shouting of many people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">speaking at once</span>.</p></li><li><p>His voice was as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">powerful as</span> the voice/noise of a great crowd of people.</p></li><li><p>His words were as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">loud as</span> the shouts of a crowd.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and his voice like the sound of a multitude:</strong> This simile compares the sound of the one man’s voice to the sound of a crowd. The point of similarity is the power and volume (loudness) with which he spoke. In many languages it will be natural to translate this as a separate clause or sentence with its own verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and when he spoke his voice <u>sounded</u> like the voice of a great multitude (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sound of his voice <u>was</u> like the roar of a multitude (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his voice <u>thundered forth</u> like the sound of a large crowd (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:6</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The overall impression given by the description should be one of impressive and powerful goodness.

He was standing on the bank of the river with some other people at the time. Use a word that can refer to a revelation of God that someone can see while they are awake. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>this</u> vision (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>10:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but a great terror fell upon them,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Nevertheless, they became so frightened</p></li><li><p>Yet they were suddenly terrified</p></li><li><p>Even so they were very afraid</p></li></ul></div><h4>10:7b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse parts 10:7b and 10:7c are in contrast. What happened in 10:7c is unexpected after 10:7b. The BSB and many English versions indicate the contrast with a conjunction at the beginning of 10:7c (“but”). In some languages it may be natural to indicate it by supplying a concessive conjunction at the beginning of 10:7b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup> <u>Although</u> the people who were with me did not see the vision, <sup>7c</sup>they became so frightened that they scattered and hid. (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>10:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the men with me did not see it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Those who were with me did not see it.</p></li><li><p>The men who were there with me did not see what I saw.</p></li><li><p>My companions did not see anything.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the men with me did not see it:</strong> This clause indicates that other people were with Daniel at the time. However, they did not see the vision; that is, they did not see the man dressed in linen. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the men who were with me did not see the vision (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the men with me saw nothing (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>10:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and they ran and hid themselves.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that they ran and hid.</p></li><li><p>and ran away to hide themselves.</p></li><li><p>and quickly hid themselves.</p></li></ul></div><h4>10:7c-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but a great terror fell upon them, and they ran and hid themselves:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> here introduces a contrast with what could be expected. Even though they did not see anything, the other people with Daniel were very frightened. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but they were suddenly terrified and ran away to hide (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Nevertheless, a great dread fell on them, and they ran away to hide themselves (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a great terror fell upon them:</strong> The Hebrew is more literally “great trembling fell on them.” Use an expression that is natural in your language to indicate a sudden terror caused by the presence of something awe-inspiring or supernatural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a great dread fell on them (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they were suddenly terrified (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my natural color turned to a deathly pallor (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my face turned deathly pale (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I became as white as a dead person</p></blockquote><h4>10:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I was powerless.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I felt extremely weak.</p></li><li><p>and I became helpless.</p></li><li><p>I was completely exhausted.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I was powerless:</strong> The Hebrew more literally says “and I kept/retained no strength.” This has a very similar meaning to 10:8b.

See also 8:18b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew text does not make it clear whether Daniel fell to the ground at this point, or whether he was already on the ground after losing his strength in the previous verse, 10:8.

This is good English style. However, in some languages, it may be necessary to place these words at the beginning of 10:12a, as they are in the Hebrew text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then he continues, “Do not be afraid, Daniel…” (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Place the words <em>he said</em> wherever they are most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Do not be afraid, Daniel:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to place the address before the command:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel, do not be afraid.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel, you do not need to be afraid.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he said:</strong> This phrase is literally “And/Then he said to me.” This phrase introduces what the man in linen said to Daniel.</p><h4>10:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“for from the first day that you purposed to understand</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>From the very first day when you sought to understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things/events</span></p></li><li><p>On the very first day that you began to desire insight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">into God’s plan</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> This verse part and the following verse part give the reason why Daniel need not be afraid. The Hebrew introduces this reason with a conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>for</em>. Some translations leave the connection implied</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the first day that you purposed to understand:</strong> The phrase <em>the first day</em> probably refers to the beginning of the fast mentioned in 10:2. This was three weeks before. At that time Daniel had “set his mind to gain understanding.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from the very first day that you applied your mind to understand (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you purposed to understand:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>purposed to understand</em> is literally “gave your heart.” It means to concentrate on something. Use the expression that is natural in your language. It is best to leave implied what Daniel wanted to understand, or to supply a general expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dedicated yourself to understanding <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things</span></p></blockquote><h4>10:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to humble yourself before your God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and humbly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">asked</span> God for help,</p></li><li><p>and humbled yourself <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and fasted</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to humble yourself before your God:</strong> This is a second thing that Daniel had set his mind to do.

This refers to different aspects of the same action. So in some languages it may be natural to combine 10:12c and 10:12b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since the first day you humbly asked for understanding (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>your words were heard,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>your request was heard <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> heard your prayers.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your words were heard:</strong> This is a passive clause and there are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb.

However, here it refers to supernatural beings who support the cause of God and righteousness. So it may be necessary to translate it differently. God’s chief angels are traditionally called “archangels,” and this is how some versions translate this word here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of the archangels (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>10:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For I had been left with the ruling powers of Persia.</p></li><li><p>I had been/remained <span data-bnType=\"implied\">struggling</span> with the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spirit</span> rulers of Persia.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for I had been left there:</strong> There is a textual problem here.

The two options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew text that we have today (the Masoretic Text or MT), which says, “and I was left there.” This is followed by several English translations.

See the General Comment on 10:16b–c following 10:16c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and said to the one standing before me:</strong> In Hebrew this phrase is literally “and I spoke and I said to the one standing before me.” The BSB has combined the two verbs “I spoke” and “I said” into one verb (<em>said</em>). This verse part continues to introduce what Daniel said when he was able to.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:16b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The three verb phrase “opened my mouth,” “began to speak,” and “said” all refer to the same action. In some languages it may be natural to combine them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I said to him (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I said (CEV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>10:16c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish, and I have no strength:</strong> Daniel told the angelic figure that he was as weak and helpless as a woman in childbirth. He had <em>no strength</em> and he was <em>overcome with anguish</em>. There are several ways to connect the clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My lord, because of the vision such anguish has come upon me that I have no strength.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sir, I am completely overwhelmed by the vision. I have no strength left.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sir, the vision has been such a shock to me that I feel numb/paralyzed/stunned</p></blockquote><h4>10:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“My lord, I am terrified because of what I have seen in the vision.</p></li><li><p>“Master, I am afraid because of what I have seen.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>My lord:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>My lord</em> is used to express great respect. Translate it in a way that is natural in your language for addressing someone of high status. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Sir (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Master (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>I am overcome with anguish</em> is literally “my pains/pangs have overpowered me.” This same expression is used of a woman in childbirth overwhelmed by the strength of her birth pains. See also Isaiah 13:8 and 21:3. The physical feeling is used here as a metaphor for feeling emotionally overwhelmed. In some languages there will be an idiom that it may be natural to use here. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>at this vision anguish has gripped me (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of this vision, pain has overwhelmed me (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this vision has brought me great distress</p></blockquote><h4>10:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I have no strength.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have become weak.</p></li><li><p>I have no more strength.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and I have no strength:</strong> The Hebrew text is literally “and I have not kept/retained strength.” The context makes it clear that Daniel was weak especially in the sense that he did not have the strength to speak well. He felt unable to talk with the great figure who had touched him. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I’m helpless (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that I have no strength left <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to talk to you</span></p></blockquote>",

It is literally “How can my lord’s servant talk with my lord?” The BSB has made it explicit that Daniel referred to himself as <em>your servant</em> and to the angelic figure as <em>my lord</em>. This may be natural or necessary in many other languages also.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This rhetorical question implies the answer “He/I cannot.” Daniel was saying that it was very hard or even impossible for him to talk with the angel. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How can someone like me, your servant, talk to you, my lord? (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>as an emphatic statement or exclamation.

I cannot talk with you, my lord!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this in a way that is natural in your language. In some languages it may be natural to indicate the reason why Daniel felt unable to talk to the angel. In those languages it may be natural to follow the CEV, which supplies the information that the angel was very powerful:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am merely your servant.

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have no strength or breath left in me. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For now no strength remains in me, and no breath is left in me. (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Now I have no strength:</strong> The Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>Now I have no strength</em> is literally “and now no strength remains in me.” Consider how to translate this idea in a way that is natural in your language. It may be natural to translate the noun <em>strength</em> as an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I do not feel strong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I feel weak</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>nor is any breath left in me:</strong> The Hebrew literally says, “and breath is not left in me.” Avoid translating this in a way that suggests that Daniel was dead or dying. He was probably saying that he was so overwhelmed that he felt breathless. That is, for Daniel, it was a struggle to breathe. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and no breath is left in me (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and it is hard for me to breathe (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and I am breathless (NET)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:17b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to link the two clauses closely together by saying that Daniel felt that he hardly had the strength to breathe. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have so little strength that it is hard to breathe.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am hardly strong enough to breathe.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am almost too weak to get my breath (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

The BSB has supplied the word <em>first</em> to help readers understand the flow of thought. This word is not explicit in the Hebrew.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what is inscribed in the Book of Truth:</strong> This is a passive phrase. In some languages it may be natural or necessary to use an active verb. However, the subject is not stated or implied, so it is best to leave it general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as they/one wrote in the Book of Truth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God caused</span> someone/them to write in the Book of Truth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>inscribed:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>inscribed</em> occurs only here in the Hebrew Bible. In this context it appears to be a synonym. You may use the same word or a synonym. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>inscribed (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the Book of Truth:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the Book of Truth</em> is literally “the writing of truth.” It is uncertain to what this refers. The word translated as <em>Book</em> is not the same as the word in Daniel 9:2 or 12:1, which is sometimes translated as “scroll.” It is a general word for something that is written. The written content is said to be <em>Truth</em> in the sense that it can be trusted as accurate and therefore reliable and dependable. Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the true writings (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>a dependable book (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>10:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"10:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Yet no one has the courage to support me against these, except Michael your prince.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yet in all these battles</span>, no one takes my side against these enemies except Michael, your<sup>(plur)</sup> prince.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You should know that</span> only Michael, the prince of your people, joins me to fight against these spiritual/demonic powers.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Yet no one has the courage to support me against these, except Michael your prince:</strong> This verse part is not connected to the previous verse part, but to the verse part that follows (11:1a in the BSB). In your translation, avoid suggesting that this is what is written in the Book of Truth. It is more likely parenthetical and gives some further information about the fight with the spiritual powers of Persia and Greece. Therefore, some English versions place 10:21b and 11:1a in parentheses (as in the NIV). Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one stands with me against these enemies except Michael, the angel ruling over your people. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one except Michael, the guardian angel of Israel, is on my side. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No one helps me against these spirit princes except Michael, your spirit prince. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Yet no one has the courage to support me against these, except Michael:</strong> In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a positive statement:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The only one who supports me against them is Michael.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Michael is my only helper/ally in my fight against those princes/rulers.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>has the courage to support me:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>support</em> means to strengthen another. That is, it means to help another to fight. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>contends by my side (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>stands firmly with me (NASB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>against these:</strong> The phrase <em>against these</em> in this context means “in the struggle/fight against them.” The pronoun <em>these</em> refers to the spiritual powers associated with Persia and Greece, the demonic figures mentioned in 10:20b and c. Translate this in a way that makes this clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>against these princes (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>when I fight these commanders (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>against these spirit princes (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your prince:</strong> The Hebrew pronoun <em>your</em> is plural. It refers to the people of Israel in general. Michael was the angel associated with Israel in some way. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israel’s guardian angel (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Note that this verse part begins with a parenthesis marking in the NIV. This is possible but not necessary. However, it is necessary to indicate that 10:21b is closely connected to 11:1a. They should be translated as part of the same paragraph. A paragraph break can be made before 11:2a or b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 10:20–21</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These verses may be difficult to understand because the answer to the question in 10:20a is not given until 10:21a. So in some languages it may be helpful to place 10:21a immediately following the question in 10:20a. The information in 10:20b–c can be moved to a position following that.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>20a</sup>He said, “Do you know why I came to you? <sup>21a</sup>It is to reveal to you what is written in the Book of Truth. <sup>20b</sup>Now I have to go back and fight the guardian angel of Persia. <sup>20c</sup>After that the guardian angel of Greece will appear. <sup>21b</sup>There is no one to help me except Michael, Israel’s guardian angel.

See also 8:8c-d, where this same event is described.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verbs <em>broken up</em> and <em>parceled out</em> are both passive. The text does not say who would do this action. There are at least two ways to translate this verse part:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his kingdom will be broken into pieces and divided in the directions of the four winds of heaven (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His kingdom will be broken apart and divided into four parts.

Use the expression that is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>toward the four parts of the world (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>into four quarters</p></blockquote><h4>11:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It will not go to his descendants,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But/And these four parts/kingdoms will not be ruled by the king’s descendants.</p></li><li><p>Men who are not his descendants will rule these four nations.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It will not go to his descendants:</strong> This clause indicates that the new rulers of the divided empire would not be the descendants of the warrior king. Four army generals inherited and ruled the four parts of the empire of Alexander the Great. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The empire will not be given to his descendants.

Their kingdoms would not be so strong as his empire was. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nor will the kingdom hold the authority it once had (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and it will not have the power that he had (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>or be as powerful as his kingdom (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>11:4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because his kingdom shall be uprooted. It will be given to others/outsiders.</p></li><li><p>For his kingdom shall come to an end and outsiders will rule in his place.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others:</strong> This verse part uses a different image to express the same idea as 11:4b. The empire is pictured as a plant that someone pulls out of the ground. There are at least two ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>keeping the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because his kingdom will be pulled up and given to other people (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>explaining the meaning of the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his empire will be destroyed and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">its remnants/remains</span> given to others</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 11:4b, both the verbs are passive in English. However, in the Hebrew text there is only one verb in this verse part. The BSB has supplied the passive verb <em>given</em>. There are several ways to translate this clause:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 11:4a-e</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using two passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for his kingdom <u>will be uprooted</u> and <u>distributed</u> to others besides these (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using one or more active verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for his kingdom shall be uprooted and <u>go</u> to others besides these (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for <u>they will tear out</u> his kingdom and <u>it will pass</u> to other rulers/men</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Since 11:4b and 11:4e are similar in meaning, in some languages it may be natural to combine them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>But at the height of his power <sup>4b,e</sup>his empire will break up and be divided into four parts. <sup>4c</sup>Kings not descended from him will rule in his place, <sup>4d</sup>but they will not have the power that he had.

This becomes clear in verse 8. You may wish to include a footnote stating that <em>the South</em> is a reference to Egypt. Many scholars believe this particular king to be Ptolemy I. He was one of Alexander the Great’s generals. After Alexander’s death in 323 B.C., Ptolemy received power in Egypt. His title was first Satrap and then Pharaoh. He ruled Egypt until his death in 282 BC. He began the Ptolomaic dynasty, which ruled in Egypt until 30 B.C. All the male rulers of this dynasty were named Ptolemy. The references to <em>The king of the South</em> in the rest of this chapter can refer to any of these Ptolomaic kings.</p><h4>11:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but one of his commanders will grow even stronger</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But one of his commanders will become more powerful than he.</p></li><li><p>However, one of his military officers will gain even more power.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but one of his commanders will grow even stronger:</strong> The Hebrew more literally says, “but one of his commanders will become strong over/against him.” This indicates that one of the Egyptian military commanders would rebel against the king of the South, the Egyptian pharaoh.

He was one of Alexander the Great’s generals and later a commander under Ptolemy. He himself came to rule a great empire now called the Seleucid Empire. He was succeeded by his son Antiochus I in 281 B.C. His family line, the Seleucid dynasty, remained in power until 64 B.C. The Seleucid Empire came to include the lands that are now known as Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. These lands are all north of Egypt, and this chapter of Daniel refers to the ruler of the Seleucid Empire as “the king of the North.” Some English versions, such as the GNT, refer to this empire as “Syria.” However, it was much larger than the country now known as Syria.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You may wish to put some of this information in a footnote.</p><h4>11:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and will rule his own kingdom with great authority.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This commander will rule his own kingdom with great power.</p></li><li><p>This officer will become king of his own kingdom/nation <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the north</span> and be very powerful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and will rule his own kingdom with great authority:</strong> There is a textual problem here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The traditional Hebrew text says “and he will rule a dominion great his dominion.” For example, the RSV follows this text says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and his dominion shall be a great dominion (RSV) <em>(BSB, RSV, KJV, NASB, ESV, NLT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other texts indicate a comparison with the dominion/kingdom of the king of the south.

That is, the pronoun refers to the Pharaoh of Egypt and the Seleucid Emperor. At the time they became allies, the two rulers were Ptolemy II (later known as Ptolemy the Great) and Antiochus II Theos. This took place several decades after the events recorded in 11:5, around 250 B.C. Here are some ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>After some years have passed, they will form an alliance (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some years later, the southern king and the northern king will make an alliance.</p></blockquote><h4>11:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to seal the agreement.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north in order to establish a marriage alliance.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">At that time,</span> the king of the south will send his daughter to marry the king of the north.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to seal the agreement:</strong> This verse part indicates that a marriage alliance was made between the two kings. The Egyptian ruler sent his daughter Berenice to marry the Seleucid Emperor, Antiochus II. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The daughter of the king of the South will marry the king of the North in order to bring peace. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king of the South will make an alliance with the king of the North and give him his daughter in marriage.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the daughter of the king of the South:</strong> This <em>daughter of the king of the South</em> was named Berenice. She was given in marriage by her father Ptolemy II of Egypt to the Seleucid Emperor Antiochus II. Antiochus had, however, previously married a woman named Laodice.</p><h4>11:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But his daughter will not retain her position of power,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, she will not be able to keep her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">position of</span> power.</p></li><li><p>However, she will lose her influence.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But his daughter will not retain her position of power:</strong> The Hebrew text literally says, “but she will not retain the power of the arm.” This probably means that Berenice lost her influence. The previous wife of Antiochus worked against her, and the alliance between the northern and southern kingdoms did not last. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But she will not keep her power (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But she will lose her power.

An “arm” is often a symbol of strength and the pronoun <em>his</em> refers to the king of the North, Antiochus. However, some scholars suggest that the correct reading is that of the Septuagint, “and not he will stand and his offspring.” The two possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The MT reading “his arm” (BSB: <em>his strength</em>) is correct. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>nor will he continue in his strength (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, KJV, NASB, ESV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Septuagint reading “his seed/offspring” is correct.

Some translations indicate that it should be placed at the beginning of 11:7. See the RSV and GNT.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>she will be given up:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB literally translates as <em>she will be given up</em> means that the daughter of the king of the South would be killed. Historical reports record that Antiochus II himself, Berenice, her son, and her Egyptian attendants were all killed by order of the first wife of Antiochus II.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:6 For details see Goldingay, Word Biblical Commentary, page 296.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they/someone will turn against her</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the form that is most natural in your language.

In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who had escorted/accompanied her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the north</span>, her father, and her husband died also.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>her royal escort:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>her royal escort</em> is literally “those who brought her.” It refers to the Egyptians who accompanied the princess to the north for the royal marriage. Many manuscripts have a singular form here, and you may use either a plural or singular form, whichever is most natural in your language. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the servants who went with her (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who brought her to that country (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>her attendants (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>her entourage</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>her father:</strong> There is a textual problem here. Some translations follow the ancient versions that read “her child.” The two options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The original text read “her father.” This is the reading of the MT, which says “the one who begot her.” However, Berenice’s father Ptolemy II did not die at the same time as Berenice, but soon after. <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, ESV, NIV, GW, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>The original text read “her child.” This is the reading of some ancient versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:6 This is the reading of the Greek translation by Theodotion, the Syriac and the Vulgate.

This is probably a reference to Berenice’s brother, who became Ptolemy III (and thus “king of the South”) after the death of his father Ptolemy II in 246 B.C. However, you should not make this explicit in the translation. You may wish to write a footnote with this information.

Use an expression that is natural and clear in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a branch from her roots (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one of her relatives (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will rise up in his place:</strong> This phrase indicates that the relative will come into power. The <em>place</em> is probably a reference to the position of ruler of Egypt. The relative of the murdered queen will become “king of the South,” of Egypt.

In the historical situation, navies as well as armies were involved, and so the NIV uses the general word “forces.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the king of the North:</strong> The phrase <em>the king of the North</em> refers to the Seleucid emperor. By this time Antiochus was dead and Seleucus II was the ruler of the northern kingdom.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>enter his fortress:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>his fortress</em> is probably a general reference to the defenses and strongholds of the northern kingdom.

He would win victories. In some languages it may be helpful and natural to make explicit who is doing the fighting, using the same terms that you used previously. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>This relative</u> will make war against <u>the king of the north</u>, and he will be victorious.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be possible to combine the ideas of fighting and being victorious into one verb.

Egypt is the southern kingdom where the relative (brother) of the murdered queen was now ruler.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and their precious vessels of silver and gold:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>their precious vessels</em> is literally “the vessels of their desire.” It refers to containers and utensils such as cups and bowls that were precious and therefore prized or valued by their owners.

In some languages it may be natural to emphasize this by placing it near the beginning of the sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The southern king will be outraged. He will go to fight the northern king (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In his anger the king of Egypt will go to war against the king of Syria (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The two Hebrew verbs that the BSB translates as <em>march out</em> and <em>fight</em> together describe the beginning of the action of fighting. In some languages they can be combined into one verb or verb phrase.

The verb <em>be delivered</em> is passive. There are two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb.

He decided to advance with all his forces toward the kingdom of the South. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will resolve to advance with the full might of his kingdom (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>His intention will be to come with the strength of his entire kingdom (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then the northern king will decide to invade with the power of his entire kingdom</p></blockquote><h4>11:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and will reach an agreement with the king of the South.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will make a peace treaty with the king of the south.</p></li><li><p>to make an alliance <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with the king of the south</span>, and the king of the north will conclude a peace agreement.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and will reach an agreement with the king of the South:</strong> There is a textual problem here. The majority of MT manuscripts say “and upright ones/things with him and he will do.” This is not clear, and some scholars suggest the text should read “he will make a treaty/alliance with him.” This is the reading of some ancient versions and some Hebrew manuscripts. However, since “upright things” can be understood as referring to a peace agreement,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:17 The KJV and the GW are alone among major English versions in keeping the reference to upright people.</span></span> the translation of the two options may be very similar. Apparently, instead of attacking the king of the South, the king of the north decided to make a peace treaty. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but will then make a treaty with him (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an agreement:</strong> In this context the word that the BSB translates as <em>an agreement</em> refers to an agreement between two kings or countries to not go to war with one another. Other ways to translate it include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>terms of an agreement (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>terms of peace (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>peace proposal</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to translate this with a descriptive phrase, as the CEV has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will attempt to make peace (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>11:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will give his daughter in marriage to the king of the south in order to overthrow his kingdom.</p></li><li><p>He will give the king of the south one of his daughters as a wife. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">His plan will be</span> to destroy the southern king’s kingdom.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He will give him a daughter in marriage:</strong> The pronouns <em>He</em> and <em>him</em> may be confusing here. The meaning is that the king of the North gave his daughter (the first Cleopatra) to the king of the South (Ptolemy V). It may be helpful to make the referent of one or both pronouns explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will give the king of the south a daughter in marriage (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The king of the North will give one of his daughters as a wife to the king of the South (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in order to overthrow the kingdom:</strong> The kingdom that the king of the North wished to overthrow was the southern kingdom, that is, Egypt. It may be necessary to make that clear in some way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to destroy <u>his enemy’s</u> kingdom (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in order to destroy the <u>southern</u> kingdom (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>11:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but his plan will not succeed or help him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But his plan will not succeed or help him.</p></li><li><p>But it will not succeed nor will it give him an advantage over the king of the south.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but his plan will not succeed or help him:</strong> The Hebrew text that the BSB translates as <em>but his plan will not succeed or help him</em> is more literally “but not it [or she] will stand and not it will happen to him.” This verse part indicates that the northern king’s plan to gain more power by marrying his daughter to the Egyptian Pharaoh did not benefit him. His daughter eventually chose to be loyal to her new husband and to Egypt rather than to her father. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but it shall not succeed or be to his advantage (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but it will not turn out to his advantage (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but his plans will fail</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But those plans will not succeed or help him (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a raiser of taxes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in</span> the glory of the kingdom (KJV) <em>(RSV, NASB, KJV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:20 See the UBS Handbook, page 298.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>a tax collector:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>a tax collector</em> means “an oppressor.” In this context it refers to someone who oppresses people by making them pay taxes or tribute to a foreign government. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>an oppressor (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>a raiser of taxes (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>an officer to oppress the people with taxes (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>for the glory of the kingdom:</strong> This phrase probably indicates that this king wanted to benefit his own kingdom. See the note above on “a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom.” Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>for the glory of the kingdom (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>in order to increase the wealth of his kingdom (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>11:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but within a few days he will be destroyed, though not in anger or in battle.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But after several years this king will be killed, but not while he is fighting or at war.</p></li><li><p>However, a short time later, someone will kill the king. He will not die while fighting a battle.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but within a few days he will be destroyed:</strong> The pronoun <em>he</em> here refers to the successor king and not to the tax collector. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit, as the REB has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>after but a brief time this king too will meet his end (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>within a few days:</strong> The Hebrew text says “in a few days.” This is an idiom for a short period of time and in most languages should not be translated literally. Here are some possible ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Shortly after this</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Soon after</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Not long after</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he will be destroyed:</strong> The Hebrew is literally “he will be broken.” In this context it refers to the killing of the king, his assassination. Historical records indicate that he was killed by order of his minister, Heliodorus.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:20 This was recorded by the ancient historian Appian. See Goldingay, page 299.</span></span> However, it is not recommended that you supply this information in the text, though you may wish to mention it in a footnote. It is best to translate this without making explicit who killed the king. There are two ways to do this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will be killed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will be put to death</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will come to a sudden end (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone will kill him</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>though not in anger or in battle:</strong> This verse part suggests that this king was to be killed in some secret and shameful way. It is recorded that Seleucus IV died when he was assassinated by order of his own minister, in 175 B.C. It was not a glorious or heroic death that people would honor.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The two ideas <em>in anger</em> and <em>in battle</em> should probably be considered as one complex idea referring to men fighting in battle. Similar English idioms include “in the heat of battle” and “in the rage of battle.” Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will not die while he is fighting in battle.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>However, he will not die during the angry fighting/raging of a war.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

Scholars agree that this is a reference to Antiochus IV. Biblical scholars indicate that he is the “little horn” of Daniel 8:9–12, 23–25. Antiochus IV gave himself the title of Epiphanes, the Manifest One (that is, God Revealed). By using this title, he claimed to be the god Zeus incarnate. You can read more about him in 1–2 Maccabees, especially 1 Maccabees chapters 1 and 6.

Historical records report that Seleucus IV was succeeded by Antiochus IV, an evil man who was not the rightful heir to the throne. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then there will arise in his place a despicable person (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A contemptible person will take his place. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The successor of the king of the North will be a worthless man</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a despicable person:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>despicable</em> means “despicable, someone whom others rightly despise.” It refers to someone who is not worthy of honor and respect. Avoid suggesting that this was a man to be pitied because others scorned him. The focus is on the idea that he <u>deserved</u> scorn or contempt. It is implied that he was evil. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a vile person (KJV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This <em>despicable person</em> is the focus of the narrative that follows. Scholars agree that this is a reference to the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes. He is also the little horn of Daniel 8:9–12, 23–25.</p><h4>11:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>royal honors will not be given to him,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will not become king with majesty and honor.</p></li><li><p>He will have no right to be king.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>royal honors will not be given to him:</strong> The pronoun <em>him</em> here refers back to the contemptible person of 11:21a. Antiochus IV was not the rightful heir to the throne. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who has no right to be king (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who is not in line for royal succession (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who doesn’t come from a royal family (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate clause or sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will not be given royal splendor. (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>11:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but he will come in a time of peace</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will come when people do not expect it</p></li><li><p>He will arrive in the kingdom unexpectedly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but he will come in a time of peace and seize the kingdom:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB literally translates as <em>come</em> is a general word. Other ways to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will come on the scene (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will suddenly appear (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in a time of peace:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>in a time of peace</em> is “in quietness.” In this context this probably means that the new ruler would gain power unexpectedly. See 8:25c, where the same word is used of the same event. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unexpectedly (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without warning (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when the people do not expect it</p></blockquote><h4>11:21d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:21d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and seize the kingdom by intrigue.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and gain power by treachery/deceit.</p></li><li><p>Then he will take control of it by deceiving/tricking people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and seize the kingdom by intrigue:</strong> The Hebrew text says “and he will take hold of royalty by smooth/slippery <span data-bnType=\"implied\">talk</span>.” This indicates that the despicable one would gain royal power by means of flattery and deceit. He would make false promises in order to have himself made king. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will gain possession of the kingdom by intrigue (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will seize the kingdom through deceit (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and seize power by trickery (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

The main options are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The MT is correct. It reads “The forces of the overflowing/flood will be swept from before him and will be broken, and also a leader of a covenant.” Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant. (NASB) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The vowels of the noun “the overflowing/flood” should be corrected to make a verb that functions to emphasize the following verb <em>will be swept away</em>. The two verbs together then mean “utterly/completely/suddenly swept away. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Armies will be utterly routed and crushed by him, the Prince of the covenant too. (NJB) <em>(RSV/NRSV, NJB, ESV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is difficult to be sure which text the less literal translations are following.

You may wish to consider the translation of the major language in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and destroyed, along with a prince of the covenant:</strong> This verb describes what happened to the army and a <em>prince of the covenant</em>. In some languages it may not be possible to refer to the destruction of an army and the killing of a man with the same verb. It may be necessary to translate this using two different verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the army will be destroyed and the leader of the covenant <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> will be killed</p></blockquote><h4>11:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then a flood of forces will be swept away before him and destroyed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Mighty armies will advance against him like a flood, but they will be overcome.</p></li><li><p>He will overpower every mighty army that comes to attack him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then a flood of forces will be swept away before him:</strong> This is probably a general statement indicating that the despicable one defeated powerful enemies on his way to establishing control.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will be broken (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will be…wiped out (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb.

Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will invade the richest parts of the provinces (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the richest provinces:</strong> The Hebrew phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the richest provinces</em> is more literally “the fatness of the province.” This is a metaphor for fertility and prosperity. The land in this area was rich and fertile and good for farming.</p><h4>11:24b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:24b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and do what his fathers and forefathers never did.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and do things that neither his father nor his other ancestors did.</p></li><li><p>He will act in a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worse</span> way than any of his ancestors.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and do what his fathers and forefathers never did:</strong> This verse part indicates that the despicable ruler would act in a way unlike that of his ancestors, the kings who ruled before him. This should be translated in a way that implies that his actions were more evil than those of his predecessors. Your translation should not imply that his accomplishments were more praiseworthy than those of his predecessors. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which is something his ancestors never did (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>acting as his father or his fathers’ fathers never acted (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will do what none of his ancestors did.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his fathers and forefathers:</strong> This phrase is an emphatic way of referring to the ancestors of the despicable ruler. Emphasize this in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not a single one of his ancestors (UBS Handbook)</p></blockquote><h4>11:24c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:24c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He will lavish plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will plunder these lands and share the goods and property among his followers.</p></li><li><p>He will take/steal all the riches <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of those regions/lands</span> and distribute them among his supporters.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He will lavish plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers:</strong> The king of the North will give to his followers the various riches and treasures that his soldiers stole. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then he will divide among his followers all of its treasures and property. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will rob the countries he defeats and give those things to his followers. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>plunder, loot, and wealth:</strong> The Hebrew words that the BSB translates as <em>plunder, loot, and wealth</em> are synonyms in this context. Together they refer to the money and treasures that the king gave to his soldiers, money and treasures that they had taken from their defeated enemies. In some languages it may be natural to describe these things with a verb or verbs rather than a series of three nouns. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the goods and property he has captured in war (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will rob the countries he defeats and will give those things to his followers. (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>11:24d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:24d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he will plot against the strongholds—but only for a time.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will plot to overthrow fortresses, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he will only succeed</span> for a short time.</p></li><li><p>He will even plan to attack and destroy fortified cities.

He will make military preparations to defeat their fortified cities. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will plan to defeat and destroy strong cities (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will make plans to attack fortresses (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but only for a time:</strong> The phrase <em>but only for a time</em> indicates that these things will only happen for a short or limited period of time. In some languages it may be helpful to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but he will be successful for only a <u>short</u> time (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But none of this will last very long.

The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>he will stir up</em> means “he will arouse” or “he will awaken.” This is a figure of speech meaning that the king will encourage himself to do something. In this context the king encouraged himself to confront the king of the South. Historical records indicate that Antiochus did go to war with Egypt in 169 B.C.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:25 See Lucas page 285, Steinmann page 527, and Goldingay pages 300–301.</span></span> Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And he shall stir up his power and his heart against the king of the south with a great army.

Use the term that is natural in your language for someone who chooses to act vigorously and enthusiastically. Avoid translating it in such a positive way as to imply that the king was a noble and courageous figure.

It is implied that this army is bigger than that of the king of the North. With this army, the king of the South will fight back and defend himself against the king of the North. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the king of the south shall wage war with a much greater and stronger army (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who will prepare for war with a large, strong army (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who will prepare to fight back with a huge and powerful army (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>11:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but will not withstand</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But the king of the south will not be able to withstand/stop <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the king of the north</span></p></li><li><p>But he will not be able to defeat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the army of the king of the north</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but will not withstand:</strong> This is an idiom referring to failure in battle.

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those who eat the king’s fine food will attempt to destroy him (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People who eat the king’s rich food will ruin him.

It is good to make it explicit, as the BSB has done, that he will go toward <u>the South</u> in order to attack it. It may also be helpful to make it explicit that the pronoun <em>he</em> here refers to the king of the North.

The king of the North was attacked by some <em>Ships of Kittim</em>. The word <em>Kittim</em> was a term used to refer to people from the islands and coastlands of the western Mediterranean.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:30 The ancient Jewish historian Josephus wrote that the term Kittim came to be used “for all islands and most maritime countries.” See Lucas, page 286.</span></span> Scholars agree that here this is a reference to the Romans, and you may wish to mention this in a footnote. Some Roman forces confronted Antiochus in 168 B.C. and demanded that he withdraw from Egypt, which he did. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ships of Kittim will sail against him (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Ships from the west will come to attack him (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The men of the west will come in ships to fight/oppose him</p></blockquote><h4>11:30b-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then he will turn back and rage against the holy covenant and do damage:</strong> After the Romans confronted him, Antiochus left Egypt and attacked Jerusalem.

Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be enraged and take action against the holy covenant (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>show his anger against the holy agreement (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So he will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant:</strong> This verse part indicates that the king of the North would go back to Jerusalem. This refers to the same journey as the previous verse part. There he would favor unfaithful Jews, those of the Jewish people who were unfaithful to their God and religion. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He shall turn back and pay attention to those who forsake the holy covenant (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Since the previous verse mentions “turning back” to Jerusalem, some translations do not repeat the travel verb (<em>he will return</em>) here. Only one journey is involved, described with two verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while showing kindness to those who are unfaithful (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will be good to those who have stopped obeying the holy agreement (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and…will favor those who forsake that holy covenant (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>show favor:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>show favor</em> is more literally “pay attention.” It is implied that he will pay attention in a positive way to these people, listening to them and helping them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who forsake the holy covenant:</strong> The phrase <em>those who forsake the holy covenant</em> refers to Jewish people who were unfaithful to Yahweh and his covenant with Israel. These people were willing to follow the pagan practices of the king of the north.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p><h4>11:30d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:30d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So he will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will return <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to Jerusalem</span> and favor those who have abandoned the holy covenant.</p></li><li><p>On his return <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to Jerusalem</span> he will ally himself with those who abandon the holy agreement that God made <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with his people</span>.</p></li></ul></div>",

Avoid suggesting that <em>Some of the wise</em> will fall into sin. The following verse part shows that this is not the meaning in this context.

There are several ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using a passive verb referring to either the refining of metal or the testing of a person. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they may be tested (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. The implied subject may be God or the persecution itself.

Some scholars take this king to still be Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Other scholars understand this to refer to another evil king, like Antiochus, who has yet to come to power.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>11:35 See the footnote in the NET.</span></span> It is recommended that you do not specify the identity of this king other than to refer to him as the king of the North (as he is called in 11:40b).</p></div><h4>11:36a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:36a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then the king will do as he pleases</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“The king will do as he pleases.</p></li><li><p>“The king will do whatever he wants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then the king will do as he pleases:</strong> This clause implies that the king will be successful and powerful. See the similar phrase in 11:3c. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the king shall act as he pleases.

However, the events described do not all seem to have taken place at the time of Antiochus IV. It is recommended that you leave this phrase as general as possible. If it is not natural to say just <em>the king</em>, you may wish to use an expression that connects or compares him to the king of verse 21 and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">vile/despicable</span> king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span> king</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the king <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the north</span></p></blockquote><h4>11:36b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:36b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and will exalt and magnify himself above every god,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will be proud and brag about himself.

He will demand that people give him more honor and respect than they give their gods. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He shall exalt himself and consider himself greater than any god (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>exalting himself and claiming to be greater than every god (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>exalt and magnify himself above every god:</strong> The Hebrew verbs that the BSB translates as <em>exalt</em> and <em>magnify himself</em> are literally “raise himself” and “make himself great.” Here the verbs are synonyms and together mean that his king will give himself great honor. In some languages it may be natural to combine them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>highly honor himself above every god (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>boast that he is greater than any god (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>proudly claim to be greater than any god (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>magnify himself:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>magnify himself</em> means “make himself great” or “show himself to be great.” Here this means that this king will try to make himself look great. That is, he will try to look powerful and important. See also 8:11a where a different form of the same verb is used. See the note there on “it set itself up to be as great as…. ”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>every god:</strong> The phrase <em>every god</em> refers in general to the false gods and idols worshiped by the pagan peoples of the time. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>every deity (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>11:36c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:36c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he will speak monstrous things against the God of gods.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He will even say terrible things about the God of gods.</p></li><li><p>He will even blaspheme against the Most High God.</p></li><li><p>He will speak awful things against the one true God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and he will speak monstrous things against the God of gods:</strong> The Hebrew word that the BSB translates as <em>monstrous things</em> is more literally “extraordinary things.” In this context they are extraordinary in a very bad way. Translate this using an expression that indicates that these things were shocking, evil, and blasphemous. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and shall speak horrendous things against the God of gods (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>even blaspheming the God of gods (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will say awful/shocking things against the God of gods</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the God of gods:</strong> This is a title for Yahweh, the God of Israel. It indicates that Yahweh is greater than the so-called gods and deities that the other nations worshiped. He is the supreme God. In your translation, avoid indicating that other gods have actual existence. See how you translated the Aramaic phrase in 2:47b and see the note there. See also the similar phrase in Psalm 136:2 and Joshua 22:22a. Here are some possible ways to translate this title:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Supreme God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Most High God (GECL)</p></blockquote><h4>11:36d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:36d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This king will continue to succeed until God’s anger has finished,</p></li><li><p>The king will prosper until God will finish this period of judgment,</p></li><li><p>The king will succeed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">at what he does</span> until the time when God will finish judging <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his people</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed:</strong> This verse part indicates that there will be a limit to the success of the evil king. He will be successful for only a certain time, <em>the time of wrath</em>. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He shall prosper until the period of wrath is completed (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will succeed, but only until the time of wrath is completed. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will be able to do this until the time of wrath is over/finished</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>until the time of wrath is completed:</strong> This refers to a time that was still future when this was written. So in some languages it may be natural to use a future tense:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until the time of wrath will be completed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>the time of wrath</em> refers to God’s expression of his anger. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until God is no longer angry (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>11:36e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:36e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for what has been decreed must be accomplished.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because what has been determined shall be done.</p></li><li><p>because what God has planned will happen.</p></li><li><p>for God will accomplish exactly what he has planned.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for what has been decreed must be accomplished:</strong> This verse part indicates that what God has planned must take place. The verb <em>has been decreed</em> is passive and there are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for what is determined shall be done (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For what has been determined will surely take place (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. God is the implied subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will do exactly what he has planned.

He will not honor them.

The king would ignore or reject this god also. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>or for the god loved by women (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb.

The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as “regard” in 11:37a is implied here. This phrase refers to honoring a deity. Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He will not respect any god (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he shall pay no respect to any other god (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to leave the verb implicit here, as the NLT has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>or for any other god (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>11:37d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"11:37d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because he will magnify himself above them all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for he will consider/declare himself greater than all of them.</p></li><li><p>and proclaim himself to be supreme over all.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because he will magnify himself above them all:</strong> The function of the Hebrew clause that the BSB translates as <em>because he will magnify himself above them all</em> can be understood in several ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>it gives the reason why this evil king behaves as he does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for he shall consider himself greater than all (NRSV) <em>(BSB, KJV, NASB, RSV/NRSV, NLT, ESV, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>it is a contrast to the phrase “regard any god.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead, he will make himself more important than any god. (NCV) <em>(NIV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>it is a summary statement that emphasizes 11:37a-b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In fact, he will put himself above all gods. (CEV) <em>(NJB, CEV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This agrees with the normal meaning of the Hebrew conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>because</em>. The NASB is therefore used as the Source Line in the Display. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for he will boast that he is greater than all (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because he will think he is greater than any of them (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>magnify himself:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>magnify himself</em> means to make oneself great or make oneself look great. This king wanted to be seen as very important and powerful, even more so than the gods that his people worshiped. See how you translated this word in 11:36b (the second verb, which the BSB translates as “magnify himself”). Compare also 8:4d, 8a, 11a, where different forms of the same verb are used.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

(NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a time of distress:</strong> The phrase <em>a time of distress</em> means “a difficult/troubled time” or “a time in which people will experience distress.” Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a period of anguish (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a time of terrible suffering (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>very troubled/difficult times</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the beginning of nations:</strong> The Hebrew is more literally “from when there was a nation/people.” There are two ways to understand this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “since Israel became a nation/people.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from the nation’s beginning (NET) <em>(NJPS, NET, REB, NABRE, probably KJV, NASB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “from the time that nations in general began to exist.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since nations first came into existence (NJB) <em>(BSB, RSV/NRSV, GNT, NIV, GW, NLT, CEV, NCV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as this more closely reflects the specific concerns of the writer, and since the Hebrew word for “nation” is singular. The NET is therefore used in the Display. However, either understanding is possible.</p><h4>12:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>However, at that time your<sup>(plur)</sup> people will be delivered.

The second phrase here probably limits the meaning of the first phrase, <em>your people</em>. Those of Daniel’s people whose names are written in the book will be delivered. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At that time your people will be rescued, all who are found inscribed in the book (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All of your people whose names are written in the book will be delivered.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>everyone whose name is found written in the book:</strong> The Hebrew text is more literally “everyone who is found written in the scroll.” The BSB and many other translations supply the word <em>name</em>. In some languages it may be natural to use plural forms here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all those whose names are found written in the book (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in the book:</strong> Scholars agree that this is a reference to the book of life. In this book God recorded the names of those whom he would deliver. This is a metaphor that refers to God’s choice and decision to deliver his people. There is a similar idea in Isaiah 4:3, Psalm 69:28, and Malachi 3:16–18.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will be delivered:</strong> This is a passive verb and there are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Using a passive verb.

The verb “to receive” or “to enjoy” is implied before the phrase <em>everlasting life</em> In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence and supply one or both verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will awaken</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">receive</span> everlasting life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some of them <u>will wake up</u> to <u>have</u> life forever (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have not translated the metaphor of sleep in 12:2a literally, then here you may say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some of them will be given eternal life (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>some will enjoy eternal life (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>12:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but others to shame and everlasting contempt.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But others <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will suffer</span> shame and eternal disgrace.</p></li><li><p>But others <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will receive/experience</span> unending/permanent disgrace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but others to shame and everlasting contempt:</strong> Here also the verb “to receive” is implied. The verb “will awaken” is probably implied.

They both refer to a situation in which others rightly scorn and despise someone. The adjective <em>everlasting</em> applies to both shame and contempt, not just to contempt. If a literal translation is unnatural or would imply that the speaker is referring to two different things, only one of which is permanent, it may be best to combine the two ideas into one.

It is good to refer to him in the same or a similar way here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the man dressed in linen clothes who was above the river (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven:</strong> The angelic being raised his hands toward heaven. This is an action that implies appealing to God. This was a customary action when swearing an oath. See Genesis 22:14 and Deuteronomy 32:40. Here the angel raised both hands, to imply that his oath was particularly solemn. In some languages this action may be more naturally described in a slightly different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>raised his hands toward heaven (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>raised both hands toward the sky (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>lifted his arms toward <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God in</span> heaven</p></blockquote><h4>12:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I heard him swear by Him who lives forever,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I heard him swear an/this oath by/in the name of the One who lives forever.</p></li><li><p>Then he took an oath in the name of the Eternal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>.

The angelic figure made an oath, a solemn promise, in the name of God. He appealed to God as his witness that what he said was true. Use the oath formula that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here. It may also be natural to make it explicit that the phrase <em>Him who lives forever</em> refers to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And I heard him swear by the name of God who lives forever (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on Daniel 12:7a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are several ways to order the information in these verse parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I heard the man dressed in linen clothes who was above the river. He raised his right hand and left hand to heaven and swore an oath by the one who lives forever. He said… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The angel raised both hands toward the sky and made a solemn promise in the name of the Eternal God.

In some languages it may be necessary to translate it in this way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will be three and a half years. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>12:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When the power of the holy people has finally been shattered,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When the power of the holy people has been completely shattered/ended,</p></li><li><p>A time will come when they will finish breaking the power of God’s people,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When the power of the holy people has finally been shattered:</strong> The Hebrew text here is difficult to interpret and the text is uncertain. It is more literally “and when he/they finish shattering [the] hand of a people of holiness” (Steinmann). “Hand” is often a metaphor for power. Here is another way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause probably means that the holy people will be persecuted until their power is brought to an end. The angelic man in linen was now answering the question in 12:6b. He related his answer to what he had said in 11:32 (“the people who know their God will firmly resist him”). English versions translate this answer in two main ways:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When the power of the holy people has been completely shattered (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as soon as they finish shattering the power of the holy people (NASB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the option that sounds most natural in your language.</p><h4>12:7e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:7e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>all these things will be completed.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>all these events will end.”</p></li><li><p>and then these things will last no longer.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all these things will be completed:</strong> This is a reference back to the question in 12:6b as to when <em>these things</em> (or “these wonders”) would end. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>all these things will be finished (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the time of</span> the completion of all these things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">at this time</span> all these things will come to an end</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:7d–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reverse the order of 12:7d–e. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All these things will end when the persecution of God’s people is over/finished.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 12:7b–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to report the angel’s words as indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And I heard him swear by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, two times, and half a time, and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end, all these things would be accomplished.

This is good English style. However, in some languages, it may be necessary to place these words at the beginning on 12:9a, where they are in the Hebrew text. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He replied, “Go on your way, Daniel…” (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The angel replied to Daniel by giving him encouragement to continue his life, which was a life of faithful service. Daniel could go and continue fulfilling the duties he was given. Avoid translating this in a way that suggests that the angelic figure was telling Daniel to go away because he did not want to talk to him anymore.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Go on your way, Daniel:</strong> You should translate this command in a positive way that implies that God was pleased with Daniel’s <em>way</em>, that is, his manner of life. The angel was not rebuking Daniel. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Daniel, go about your business (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You may go/continue on your way, Daniel.</p></blockquote><h4>12:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for these words/matters must/will remain secret and sealed/hidden until the time of the end.</p></li><li><p>For what I have told you to write will be kept secret <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the book</span> until the time of the end.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end:</strong> This verse part gives the reason why Daniel could go on his way in peace. The things he had heard and written about were not for his time. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For these matters are closed and sealed until the time of the end. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the words are closed up and sealed:</strong> This is a figure of speech. The <em>words</em> that the angel had spoken are referred to as if they were themselves a scroll that Daniel had rolled up and sealed, so that it could not be read. Daniel had been commanded to do this in 12:4a. Here in 12:9b the scroll is not mentioned explicitly, but the verbs are the same. In your translation, try to use the same verbs that you used in 12:4a so that readers can see the connection and understand that Daniel obeyed the command.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>you may keep the figure of speech in both verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the words are shut up and sealed (ESV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>you may explain that the phrase <em>the words</em> is a reference to the words written in the scroll book. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the words <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this scroll/book</span> have been sealed shut</p></blockquote></li><li><p>you may keep the figure of speech in one of the verbs and explain its meaning in the other. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the words are to remain secret and sealed until the time of the end (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>you may translate just the meaning of the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>these words are to be kept secret and hidden (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The verbs <em>are closed up</em> and <em>sealed</em> are both passives.

The time period is equal to about three and a half years. The significance of the number of days is uncertain, and it is best to translate the number literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>One thousand two hundred and ninety days will go by after the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is not natural in your language to express such a number exactly, you may need to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The days of three and a half years will pass after the daily sacrifice is ended and the horrible sacrilege is set up</p></blockquote><h4>12:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And from the time the daily sacrifice is abolished</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>From the time when the daily sacrifice is abolished</p></li><li><p>From the time when they stop <span data-bnType=\"implied\">offering</span> the regular/continual burnt offering</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And from the time the daily sacrifice is abolished:</strong> The Hebrew verb that the BSB translates as <em>is abolished</em> literally means “is removed, is turned away.” The daily sacrifice was to be removed or abolished in the sense that it was no longer offered. This is probably primarily a reference to the action of Antiochus IV in 167 B.C. See the notes on 8:11–13, where this same action is described using different verbs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause and there are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from when they abolish the daily sacrifice</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the daily sacrifice:</strong> This refers to the practice of offering a daily sacrifice. It does not refer to one specific sacrifice. So in some languages it may be natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the daily sacrifices</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same phrase is used to refer to the same sacrifices in 8:11b. Translate it here in the same way as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the regular burnt offering (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the regular offering (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the set/regular offerings</p></blockquote><h4>12:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the abomination of desolation set up,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and an abominable/disgusting object is set up, an object that causes destruction,</p></li><li><p>that is, from the time someone sets up <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Temple</span> a pagan thing/idol that destroys <span data-bnType=\"implied\">everything</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the abomination of desolation set up:</strong> Scholars agree that this is also a reference to the actions of Antiochus IV. He placed an altar to the pagan god Zeus in God’s Temple in Jerusalem, and pigs and other unclean animals were offered there. This is also a passive clause and there at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and the abomination that causes desolation is set in place (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. Try to use a general subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they/men</span> set up the abominable thing that causes desolation</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the verb form that is most natural in your language in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the abomination of desolation:</strong> See 9:27c, where the same phrase occurs in the plural form, and 11:31c. Translate this here as you did there. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the abomination that makes desolate (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the disgusting thing that causes destruction (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the desolating sacrilege (NRSVUE)</p></blockquote><h4>12:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"12:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>there will be 1,290 days.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>there will be one thousand, two hundred and ninety days.</p></li><li><p>1,290 days will pass.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there will be 1,290 days:</strong> The BSB has supplied the words <em>there will be</em>, which are not in the Hebrew text.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>there are 1,290 days (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>1,290 days will pass (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>1,290 days:</strong> This number of days represents three and a half years.

God counts or declares <em>Blessed</em> those who patiently endure until the end of the 1,335 days.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Blessed is he who waits:</strong> The people who patiently wait are <em>Blessed</em> in the sense that their situation is truly good, however it might appear, for God will reward them.
