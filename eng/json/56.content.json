He wrote his own name and the name of anyone else who was sending the letter. Then he wrote the name of the person or people to whom he was sending the letter. And then he would give a Christian greeting. Paul included all three of these elements in his letter to Titus:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 1:1–3, Paul introduced himself as the writer of the letter.</p></li><li><p>In 1:4a, he named Titus as the person receiving the letter.</p></li><li><p>1:4b contains Paul’s Christian greeting to Titus.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">When people in your area write letters, they may use a different order. Perhaps they put the name of the writer at the end, as we do in English. However, when you translate Titus, you should keep the name of the writer, the name of the one receiving the letter, and the greeting in the opening section. Once you have decided on the best and most natural way to do this in your language, follow that way in all of Paul’s letters.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this section is one long sentence. Some English versions also translate it as just one sentence. However, you will probably want to break it up into several sentences as you try to express all the different ideas that Paul mentioned.</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul, a servant of God</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from</span> Paul. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> a slave/servant of God</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> serve God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul:</strong> The apostle Paul was the writer of this letter. He began the letter with his name. In some languages it is not natural for a person to refer to himself only by his name, as Paul did here. If that is the case in your language, you may want to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not use a verb here. In some languages, it may be natural to supply a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am sending/writing this letter</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a servant of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> normally refers to an unpaid servant or slave. Paul said that he was God’s slave. This implied that he belonged to God and that he served God by doing what God told him to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a slave of God (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a worker of/for God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> serve God</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and an apostle of Jesus Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and an apostle of Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>and I have been sent by Jesus Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an apostle of Jesus Christ:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>an apostle</em> means “a messenger” or “a person who is sent on a mission.” It refers to a person who is given authority to do a task or give a message. This person represents the person who sent him and has his authority. In this context, Paul was sent by Jesus Christ to represent him and do the task that Jesus gave him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate the phrase <em>an apostle of Jesus Christ</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person sent to speak/act on behalf of Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">special</span> messenger from Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a representative of Jesus Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a man with authority <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated <em>apostle</em> in Romans 1:1b, 1 Corinthians 1:1a and 1 Timothy 1:1b. Translate here in the same way that you did there. Be careful to choose different terms for “apostle,” “angel,” “elder,” and “prophet.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of Jesus Christ:</strong> In the phrase <em>Jesus Christ</em>, <em>Jesus</em> is a personal name and <em>Christ</em> is a title. The title <em>Christ</em> is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word “Messiah.” Your translation should not imply that <em>Christ</em> is a surname.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">To make it clear that <em>Christ</em> is a title, you may want to:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Put the title before the name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ Jesus</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it as “Messiah” or “the Messiah.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Messiah Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus the Messiah</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Indicate in some other way that Christ is a title. One way to do this in English is to use the article “the” before a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jesus the Christ</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the faith of God’s elect</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I have been sent</span> to strengthen the faith of those whom God has chosen</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He sent me</span> to help God’s chosen people trust/believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the faith of God’s elect:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> here probably indicates purpose. It introduces Jesus’ purpose in choosing Paul to be his apostle. Scholars have interpreted the phrase <em>for the faith of God’s elect</em> in at least two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that Paul was made an apostle to help <u>believers</u> to <u>believe more strongly</u> in Jesus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to help the faith of God’s chosen people (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, CEV, NCV, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that Paul was made an apostle in order to explain the gospel to <u>people who were not yet believers</u>, so that they would <u>begin to believe</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to lead God’s chosen people to faith (GW) <em>(NJB, NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both were Paul’s job, and we cannot be certain which one Paul was focusing on here. If you can translate this verse so that it can mean both things, you may do so. If you must make a choice, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), because the term <em>God’s elect</em> most naturally refers to those who are already Christians.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Of the two interpretations given for 1:1c, probably the first is closer to Paul’s meaning. In this letter to Titus, Paul talks about teaching believers true teachings and how believers should behave. So it is more likely that in 1:1c he is talking about helping believers to believe more strongly. Also, in other places in the NT, the word <em>elect</em> (Greek: <em>eklektos</em>) refers to people who are already believers (for example, see Colossians 3:12, 1 Peter 1:1–2, 2:9, Revelation 17:14).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order to encourage the faith of God’s chosen ones</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for the sake of the faith of God’s elect (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to supply a verb and translate this as a complete sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was sent to help the faith of God’s chosen people (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I encourage God’s own people to have more faith (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God’s elect:</strong> This phrase refers to the people whom God chose to believe in him and be his special people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those chosen of God (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those chosen by God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people whom God chose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be his own/special people</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and their knowledge of the truth</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to increase</span> their knowledge of what is true.</p></li><li><p>and learn more about the true <span data-bnType=\"implied\">teaching/message</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and their knowledge of the truth:</strong> This phrase indicates the second purpose for which Paul was made an apostle. Paul was also made an apostle in order to help God’s chosen people know the truth better. The word <em>truth</em> refers to the gospel message, that is, the teachings of Christianity and the truth about Jesus Christ and his work.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to strengthen</span> their knowledge of the true things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and to help them know the truth (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I teach them to understand his true message (EASY)</p></blockquote><h4>1:1e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that leads to godliness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This will teach/help them to live as God wants them to live.</p></li><li><p>This <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true teaching/message</span> will guide them to act/behave in a way that honors/pleases God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that leads to godliness:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godliness</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>a way of life that pleases God</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that shows people how to serve God (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, ESV, RSV, NET, GW, NLT, NCV, KJV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>religion</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>taught by our religion (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, NJB, REB, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul was saying that this true teaching causes people to behave in a way that honors God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that shows them how to live godly lives (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As a result they will live in a way that pleases God.

The two main interpretations<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Harold Greenlee’s book, <em>An Exegetical Summary of Titus and Philemon</em>, lists several different ways to interpret the connection between 1:1 and <em>the hope of eternal life</em> in 1:2. There is also a discussion of this problem in the SSA (John Banker’s book <em>Semantic Structure Analysis of Titus</em>). Some of the other interpretations are:(1) <em>the hope of eternal life</em> relates to the phrase “an apostle of Jesus Christ” in 1:1. It tells the purpose of Paul’s work: “Jesus Christ made me his apostle so I could help God’s chosen people to strongly believe in him, and so I could cause them to know the true teaching, <strong>and so I could give them the hope of eternal life</strong>.”(2) <em>the hope of eternal life</em> is the basis for Paul’s being an apostle: “I am an apostle of Jesus Christ…<strong>because I have the hope of eternal life</strong>.”(3) <em>the hope of eternal life</em> is the basis for us having faith and knowledge. “We have faith in Jesus and know the truth <strong>because we have the hope of eternal life</strong>.”</span></span> are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The <em>hope of eternal life</em> is the <u>purpose or result</u> of the faith and knowledge mentioned in 1:1c-d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then they will have the hope of eternal life. (CEV) <em>(NJB, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The <em>hope of eternal life</em> is the <u>basis or grounds</u> of this faith and knowledge. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>which is based on the hope for eternal life (GNT) <em>(NIV84, GNT, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Although interpretation (2) is possible from the Greek, normally in the NT <em>eternal life</em> is the result of faith. It is the ultimate goal of believing in Jesus and knowing his truth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because of their faith and knowledge, they hope to live forever.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> means “confident hope” or “waiting for and expecting something to happen.” Christians can know for certain that God will do what he has promised. They can believe what he has said without any doubt. In English the word <em>hope</em> often indicates that we are not sure that something will happen. For instance, when we say “I hope that it rains,” it means that we want it to rain but we do not know if it will. This is not the Greek meaning of the word.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the expectation</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they are certain/sure</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal life:</strong> The word <em>eternal</em> refers to something that does not end. The phrase <em>eternal life</em> refers to life in God’s kingdom. This life continues forever.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>life forever</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>life that does not end</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be best to translate <em>life</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will live eternally</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> forever</p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God, who never lies, promised this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal life</span> before time/history began.</p></li><li><p>Before anything in this world happened, God promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that his people would live forever</span>.

He wrote his own name and the name of anyone else who was sending the letter. Then he wrote the name of the person or people to whom he was sending the letter. And then he would give a Christian greeting. Paul included all three of these elements in his letter to Titus:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>In 1:1–3, Paul introduced himself as the writer of the letter.</p></li><li><p>In 1:4a, he named Titus as the person receiving the letter.</p></li><li><p>1:4b contains Paul’s Christian greeting to Titus.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">When people in your area write letters, they may use a different order. Perhaps they put the name of the writer at the end, as we do in English. However, when you translate Titus, you should keep the name of the writer, the name of the one receiving the letter, and the greeting in the opening section. Once you have decided on the best and most natural way to do this in your language, follow that way in all of Paul’s letters.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this section is one long sentence. Some English versions also translate it as just one sentence. However, you will probably want to break it up into several sentences as you try to express all the different ideas that Paul mentioned.</p></div><h4>1:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To Titus, my true child in our common faith:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I write this letter</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you,</span> Titus. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are like</span> my true son because of the faith that we<sup>(incl/dual)</sup> share.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you,</span> Titus. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are like</span> my own son because we<sup>(incl/dual)</sup> both believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the same thing</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To Titus, my true child:</strong> Paul now indicated to whom he was writing, that is, to whom his letter was addressed. Paul probably called Titus his <em>true child</em> because Paul had been responsible for him becoming a believer. The phrase also implies that Paul loved Titus as though he were his son.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>1:4 Some commentators say that the word <em>true</em> means that Titus was a loyal, faithful believer and Paul knew that he could depend on Titus. Only the NRSV has “my loyal child.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Titus was not actually Paul’s child in the physical sense. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit in order to avoid a wrong meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you are like</span> my true son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is as if you are</span> my own son</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are <u>like</u> a son to me (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in our common faith:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>our common faith</em> mean “the faith that we have in common” or “the faith that we share.” Paul and Titus both believed in Jesus and in his gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the faith that we have in common (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the faith that we share (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because you</span> believe the same <span data-bnType=\"implied\">teachings about God that I do</span> (SSA)</p></blockquote><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace. (GNT)</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray to</span> God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(incl)</sup></span> Father and to Christ Jesus the one who saves us<sup>(incl)</sup> to show you<sup>(sing)</sup> kindness and give you peace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior:</strong> In the early days of Christianity, these words were a common Christian greeting. They form a blessing or prayer. Paul was asking God to bless Titus by giving him <em>Grace and peace</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to supply a verb or verbs in this blessing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior <u>give</u> you grace and peace. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">know/experience</span> grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">receive</span> grace from God the Father and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">live in</span> peace through Christ Jesus our Savior.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be natural to translate one or both of the abstract nouns <em>Grace</em> or <em>peace</em> as verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I pray that God our Father and Christ Jesus our Savior <u>will be kind to you</u> and will bless you with peace! (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This greeting is similar to the greetings Paul used in other letters. See, for example, Romans 1:7d, Ephesians 1:2, and Philippians 1:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Grace</em> means “kindness” or “favor.” Paul wanted God to show kindness and favor to Titus. See “grace&quot;, sense A1, in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kindness/goodness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>favor</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>peace</em> in this context refers to inner well-being. This sort of peace comes from being in relationship with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Even if you normally translate “grace” or <em>peace</em> as a long phrase, you may want to use something shorter in this greeting. Here Paul was not teaching about “grace” and <em>peace</em>. So it may not be necessary to include all the elements normally associated with these terms.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God the Father:</strong> In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this phrase as “God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God our Father (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>Christ Jesus</em> has the same meaning as “Jesus Christ” (1:1b). If the people who read your translation will be confused by the different order of the words, you may use the more familiar order “Jesus Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Savior:</strong> This is the same word that Paul used in 1:3b. In 1:3b he called God “our Savior.” Here in 1:4b he uses the same title for Jesus. You should use the same term in both verses.</p>",

He made a general statement about what he wanted Titus to do and then talked about how to choose men to be the leaders in the local churches. This section, especially 1:6–8, is very similar to 1 Timothy 3:1–7. If you have already translated 1 Timothy, you should compare your work there with the list here in Titus. Both lists talk about the character and behavior of elders in the church.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul writes to Timothy concerning the appointment of church leaders</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instructions on how to select men to be elders in the churches</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Qualifications for church leaders</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The reason I left you in Crete was</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I asked you to remain on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the island of</span> Crete</p></li><li><p>¶ When I left Crete, I asked you to stay there.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The reason I left you in Crete:</strong> This phrase introduces Paul’s purpose in leaving Titus on the island of Crete. Some time before Paul wrote this letter, he had been on the island of Crete with Titus. At some point Paul had to leave to go somewhere else. He left Titus in charge of helping the new churches and teaching the believers. So here in 1:5 Paul was reminding Titus of things he had already told him some time before.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is why I left you in Crete (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I left you in Crete, so that (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I left you in Crete:</strong> Paul asked Titus to stay in Crete to do a specific job. Avoid translating this in a way that suggests that Paul abandoned Titus without discussing it with him. It may be possible to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I left Crete, I asked you to remain there</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to use direct speech here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When I left Crete, I said to you, “I want you to stay here.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Crete:</strong> Crete is a large island in the Mediterranean Sea. In some languages it may be natural to make this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Crete <span data-bnType=\"implied\">island</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the island of</span> Crete</p></blockquote><h4>1:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that you would set in order what was unfinished</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you could <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continue</span> doing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the work</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> had not had time to finish.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I wanted</span> you to organize the matters <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the local churches</span> that still needed attention.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was that you would set in order what was unfinished:</strong> This verse part tells the reason why Paul left Titus in Crete. Paul wanted Titus to put in order some things that had not yet been completed. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was to set in order the remaining matters (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to do what still needed to be done (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that you could put in order the things that still needed doing (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>set in order:</strong> This phrase means “organize” or “cause things to be the way they should be.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>what was unfinished:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>what was unfinished</em> is more literally “the left/remaining things.” There were some things that Paul thought should be done for the churches on Crete that had not yet been done. The churches needed to have proper leadership, false teachers needed to be corrected, and people needed to be taught proper doctrine and how Christians should behave. Paul had started this work and now asked Titus to continue it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, avoid implying that someone was to blame for not finishing the task. Paul was not accusing Titus or anyone else of not finishing something. He was just saying that there was more yet to do. It may be helpful to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the things that still need doing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the remaining tasks/items</p></blockquote><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and appoint elders in every town,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In every town <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you should</span> put elders in charge of each church,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I asked you to</span> choose men to lead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the congregations</span> in every town <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on Crete where there are believers</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and appoint elders in every town:</strong> This was a further reason why Paul had left Titus on Crete. Appointing elders was probably one of the things that had not yet been done.

The text does not say how this happened. If possible, you should use a term or expression which does not specify <u>how</u> Titus was to appoint them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way this could be translated:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put them in the seat/position of elder</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>elders:</strong> The word <em>elders</em> literally means “old men.” Here it refers to church leaders, men who helped to teach the other believers and who made decisions in the church.</p><h4>1:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as I directed you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as I told you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do</span> .</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Remember</span> how I instructed you to do this.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as I directed you:</strong> Before Paul left Crete, he had given Titus instructions about choosing these elders.

They should be godly men whom others respected.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul used the singular: “An elder…he…he….” But what Paul was saying was true for <u>everyone</u> who wanted to become an elder. If it is more natural in your language to use a plural, you could translate like this: “<u>Men/People</u> whom you choose to be <u>elders</u> should be.…<u>They</u> should be…” Once you have decided whether you should use singular or plural, be consistent throughout 1:6–9.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is an example of an English version that uses plural forms in these verses:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6</sup>they must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage. Their children must be followers of the Lord and not have a reputation for being wild and disobedient.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7</sup>Church officials are in charge of God’s work, and so they must also have a good reputation.

They must also be sensible, fair, pure, and self-controlled. <sup>9</sup>They must stick to the true message they were taught, so their good teaching can help others and correct everyone who opposes it.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Faithful in marriage (CEV) <em>(CEV, NLT, NIV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that a church leader must not have more than one wife at a time (<u>no polygamy</u>). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the husband of one wife (NET) <em>(BSB, ESV, GW, GNT, KJV, NASB, NCV, NET, RSV, REB, NJB, NIV84)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that a church leader must not be someone who has remarried after the death of his spouse or their divorce (<u>no remarriage</u> ). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>married only once (NABRE) <em>(NABRE, NRSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Option (1) is supported by many commentaries, although it is followed by only a few English versions. It is possible that Paul had both ideas (1) and (2) in mind, that is, that he thought of a man “of one woman” as one who did not take either a lover or a second wife but had intimate relations with only one woman. Option (3) is less likely. Paul approved of remarriage for widows (1 Corinthians 7:8–9) and did not indicate that he would have given different advice to widowers. In New Testament times it was not uncommon for a young woman to die in childbirth and many Christian men must have remarried.

He made a general statement about what he wanted Titus to do and then talked about how to choose men to be the leaders in the local churches. This section, especially 1:6–8, is very similar to 1 Timothy 3:1–7. If you have already translated 1 Timothy, you should compare your work there with the list here in Titus. Both lists talk about the character and behavior of elders in the church.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other possible headings for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul writes to Timothy concerning the appointment of church leaders</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instructions on how to select men to be elders in the churches</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Qualifications for church leaders</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As God’s steward, an overseer must be above reproach—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Since a church leader is in charge of God’s work, he must have no faults.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> gives church leaders the job of caring for the believers. Therefore, people should not be able to accuse them of doing any wrong.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As God’s steward, an overseer must be above reproach:</strong> The Greek is more literally “For an overseer/bishop must be blameless as a steward of God.” God has given overseers the responsible position of steward, and so it is important that they be blameless.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For since a church leader is in charge of God’s work, he should be without fault. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>An overseer is God’s servant who takes care of his work/people. So he must be without fault.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because a bishop is a supervisor appointed by God, he must have a good reputation. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to follow the Greek order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For the overseer must be blameless as one entrusted with God’s work. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Since Paul was writing about overseers in general and not one particular overseer, in some languages it may be natural to use a plural form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has given overseers the task of watching over his people. So they must be without blame.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>overseer:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>overseer</em> is often translated as “bishop.” Many scholars think that “elder” (1:5) and <em>overseer</em> are two words for the same church leaders. According to this interpretation, Paul was still talking about the kind of people whom Titus should choose to be elders.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God’s steward:</strong> This phrase indicates that the overseer had the position of steward working for God. In New Testament times, a steward was an important servant who was responsible to manage his master’s business, possessions, or household. A master often gave his steward authority over other servants. And in the church, the work of the church leader is to look after the work and ministry of the church and to take care of God’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a supervisor appointed by God (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>responsible for the welfare/wellbeing of God’s people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>must be above reproach:</strong> Paul was saying that it is necessary for church leaders to be <em>above reproach</em>. The phrase <em>above reproach</em> translates the same word that Paul used in 1:6a that the BSB translated as “blameless.” You should translate it in the same way in both places.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a church leader must be blameless</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You should choose those who are blameless.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Choose blameless men.</p></blockquote><h4>1:7b–8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Here Paul began to describe in more detail how a church leader should behave. In 1:7b–d Paul listed five ways in which a church leader <u>should not</u> behave. Then in 1:8 Paul listed six ways in which a church leader <u>should</u> behave.</p><h4>1:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not self-absorbed, not quick-tempered,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">choose</span> someone who is determined to get his way, or someone who easily loses his temper,</p></li><li><p>They must not be men who demand their own way or get angry quickly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not self-absorbed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>self-absorbed</em> means “arrogant, bossy.” Paul said that a church overseer is not to be like this. He must not insist on his own way as though he were a king or dictator or boss.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not arrogant (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must not be one who demands his own way.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They must not be bossy (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not quick-tempered:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>quick-tempered</em> means “quick to get angry.” The church leader must not be someone who becomes angry quickly or easily. He must keep his anger under control.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not become angry quickly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not hot tempered</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must not get angry easily.

It refers mainly to fighting physically, but it can include yelling and arguing, too. Paul wrote that church leaders must not be men who behaved like this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not fight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a lot</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like to</span> fight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with others</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same word is used in 1 Timothy 3:3b.

Scholars have interpreted it in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>doing wrong things in order to become wealthy</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>use shameful ways to make money (GW) <em>(NIV, CEV, NCV, GW, NABRE)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>strongly desiring to become wealthy</u>.

This kind of person might use his position of authority in the church as a way to get money from other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this is phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must not be a person who will do anything to get money.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must not try to get money by cheating people (NIrV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same term is used in 1 Timothy 3:8.</p>",

It refers to holding something in one’s mind rather that in one’s physical body. Use the expression that is natural in your language for faithful belief in something.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the faithful word:</strong> This phrase refers to the gospel teachings about Jesus Christ. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>faithful</em> means “reliable” or “sure.” It refers to something that is true and does not change.

A literal English translation of the Greek is “according to the teaching.” Paul is saying that the church leaders must firmly believe the same teaching about Jesus Christ that he and the other apostles taught. They must not change those teachings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is passive. There are several ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must do this</span> so that he can encourage others by teaching doctrine that is true.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to translate this purpose clause as a clause that indicates the expected result.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And I, Paul, say that</span> this saying is true</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the prophet</span> said <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about the Cretans</span> is true.</p></blockquote><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore rebuke them sternly,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore, rebuke<sup>(sing)</sup> them strongly</p></li><li><p>So you must rebuke those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are fighting/arguing with their leaders</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore rebuke them sternly:</strong> The phrase <em>rebuke them sternly</em> means to tell them very strongly that they are wrong. The Greek tense indicates an ongoing action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore, keep/continue rebuking them strongly</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>them:</strong> This word probably refers to the rebellious people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Someone rebukes someone else because the other person is doing something bad. The rebellious people are most clearly doing something bad. The saying of the Cretan prophet is only an explanation of why these rebellious people are that way. It is not introducing all the people of Crete as the subject of Paul’s instructions.</span></span> In some languages a literal translation will be clear enough. In some languages explaining who this group is will be helpful. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those rebellious people</p></blockquote><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that they will be sound in the faith</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that their faith will be correct/right</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">My purpose/goal</span> is that they will believe strongly/firmly in the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> faith.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that they will be sound in the faith:</strong> This is a purpose clause. The phrase <em>so that</em> introduces Paul’s first purpose in telling Titus to rebuke rebellious people. He wanted Titus to help them become strong in the true faith.

This includes its doctrines about Jesus Christ and the gospel as well as its teachings about how Christians should behave.</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Teach</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instruct (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The older men should be sober, dignified, and temperate (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instruct the older men to be sober, sensible, and self-controlled (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Older men:</strong> The Greek word refers in general to male believers who were older than 40 or 50. It is similar to, but not the same as, the word used for elders of the church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>temperate:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>temperate</em> means “restrained” or “moderate.” It usually refers to not drinking too much alcohol but can also have the wider meaning of being restrained and moderate in conduct and behavior. See how you translated the same word at 1 Timothy 3.2c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sober (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sober-minded (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>calm</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dignified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>dignified</em> describes someone who is respected by others and deserves to be so respected. This kind of respect was associated with the behavior of a serious and mature person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>worthy of respect (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>respectable</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>self-controlled:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>self-controlled</em> describes someone who is thoughtful and deliberate in his actions rather than impulsive. See how you translated it in 1:8c and translate it the same way in both places. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They must control themselves. (NIrV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>able to control themselves</p></blockquote><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and sound in faith, love, and perseverance.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They must firmly believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span>, sincerely love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>, and faithfully follow <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>Their trust in God and their love for others should be solid. They should not turn back/away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the Lord</span> during difficult times.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and sound in faith, love, and perseverance:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sound</em> is literally “healthy,” that is, health-giving or wholesome. Here it describes a man as being solid and firm in the way he trusts God, loves others, and endures hardship. It is the same word used in 2:1 to describe correct doctrine. If possible, translate it the same in both places.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The three phrases <em>in faith, love, and perseverance</em> list three areas in which the older men should be solid and firm. The word <em>in</em> connects the areas of behavior (<em>faith</em>, <em>love</em>, and <em>perseverance</em>) to the word <em>sound</em> . Consider how best to indicate this in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sound in faith, sound in love, sound in endurance</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>strong in faith, in love, and in patience (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Their faith, love, and patience must never fail. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They must have sound faith and be filled with love and patience. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in faith:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>faith</em> here refers to trust in God, trust that comes from Christian belief. The older men should trust in God completely for everything they need.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the way they trust God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in their trust in God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>love</em> here refers to the affection and warm regard that one person shows to another person. The older men should be healthy in the way they show love to others. They should be selfless in service to other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the way they love other people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and perseverance:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>perseverance</em> refers to the ability to not give up in the face of difficulty. Paul wanted the older men to endure or bear hardship. They should be patient and not quit when they met difficulties.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and in the way they bear up during difficult times</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and in patience</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts include four items in a list (“temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, sound”). The BSB follows English style by separating the first three items with a comma and supplying the word “and” between the last two. Each of the items describes a type of behavior that the older men should follow. The verb “to be” is therefore implied for each of them. Follow your language style for constructing such a list.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB has translated 2:2a-b as one clause. In some languages it may be more natural to translate this verse as two or more clauses or sentences, with more than one imperative verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a</sup>Tell older men to be sober. Tell them to be men of good character, to use good judgment, <sup>2b</sup>and to be well-grounded in faith, love, and endurance. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a</sup>Teach the older men to exercise self-control, to be worthy of respect, and to live wisely. <sup>2b</sup>They must have sound faith and be filled with love and patience. (NLT)</p></blockquote></div>",

The context suggests that it refers to women who were of a similar age to the men mentioned in 2:2, women in their forties or fifties or older.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>likewise:</strong> This word indicates that Paul’s next comments are similar to what he has just said. The older women should act in similar ways to the older men. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the same way</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reverent:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reverent</em> refers to behavior appropriate for a holy person, that is, someone who is dedicated to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to live their lives in a way that shows they are dedicated to God (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to show their dedication to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to behave as holy women should</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in their behavior:</strong> The phrase refers generally to the way that they live, particularly the way they speak and look.

Here it refers to gossips, people who tell bad stories about others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not speaking against others (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not to be gossips (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This behavior, and the one that follows, is something the older women should <u>not</u> do.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They should not be slanderers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Tell them not to be gossips (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or addicted to much wine:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>addicted</em> is more literally “enslaved.” It refers to a person who is completely controlled by something or someone else. It is the second behavior the older women should <u>not</u> follow.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>or enslaved to too much wine (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not slaves to excessive drinking (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and not controlled by alcohol</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>much wine:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>wine</em> refers to a fermented alcoholic drink. It was a very common everyday drink in cultures of that time and place. Usually water was added to make it less intoxicating. The word <em>much</em> refers to drinking an excess of wine. Paul was not saying that the older women should not drink any wine at all.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>too much wine (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>excessive drinking (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>2:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but teachers of good.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They should teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> things that are good/right.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Tell them</span> to teach good things</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but teachers of good:</strong> In Greek this is a single word meaning “good teacher.” The BSB has supplied the word <em>but</em> to indicate a contrast with what the women should not do.

It indicates Paul’s purpose in telling Titus to teach in a serious and sincere way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>anyone who opposes us:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>anyone who opposes us</em> is more literally, “the opponent.” Paul probably did not have any one person in mind, but was referring in general to anyone who opposed Titus during his time of ministry on Crete. You may translate it using either a singular or plural form, whichever is most natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>any opponent (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>your enemies (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>us:</strong> This word is not in the Greek. Some versions add it or the word “you” in order to have an object for the verb “oppose.” If it is more natural in your language to say who “the opponent” is opposing, you may add either “us” to refer to Paul, Titus, and others who are working to promote the gospel message, or “you” or “your” to refer to Titus. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>those who oppose you (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>your enemies (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will be ashamed:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>will be ashamed</em> is in the passive.

In Paul’s time it was very common for wealthy people to buy and sell slaves. Sometimes people were captured during war and became slaves. Sometimes they fell into debt and sold themselves to pay it off. The owner of the slave had complete control of his life and could make him do any kind of work without pay.

Paul gave Titus the reason why he should give the preceding instructions to the Christians. Titus should do this because God had sent Jesus Christ to earth to save everyone who believes in him, even though they do not deserve to be saved.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Scholars do not agree about where the words <em>to everyone</em> fit into this sentence. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>to everyone</em> belongs with the phrase translated as <em>bringing salvation</em>. This is the view of most English versions and commentators. So the meaning is: “God has revealed his kindness by providing a way <u>to save all people</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people (NASB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, NET, GW, NRSV, NABRE, NCV, NLT, CEV, GNT, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>to everyone</em> belongs with the verb <em>appeared</em>, that is, God’s grace <em>has appeared</em> to all people. So the meaning is: “God has <u>revealed to all people</u> his kindness which gives them a way to be saved.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. (NIV84) <em>(NIV84, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1), along with the majority of English versions and commentaries.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> links this paragraph to the previous verses (2:1–10). It introduces the reason for the instructions that Paul gave in 2:1–10.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the grace of God has appeared:</strong> This clause indicates that God’s <em>grace</em> has been shown or given to people. That is, God has revealed his grace to people. He has shown them his undeserved kindness and generosity by sending Jesus to be their Savior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be possible to make <em>grace</em> the subject of the clause. Instead it may be more natural to make God the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For God has revealed his grace (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has shown us clearly how very kind he is (EASY)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has graciously/freely shown us his kindness/favor</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the grace of God:</strong> The phrase <em>the grace of God</em> here refers to the kindness that God freely shows to people because he is good and generous. It implies that people have not done anything to deserve this kindness. He himself chooses to help them and show them favor. Some other ways to translate the phrase <em>the grace of God</em> in this context are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>the kindness of God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God’s merciful goodness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bringing salvation to everyone:</strong> God’s grace is shown in the salvation that is made available to all people. The BSB has supplied the verb <em>bringing</em>. Other English translations supply different verbs or phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that offers salvation to all people (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that can save everyone (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>salvation:</strong> This word refers to being rescued from something harmful or dangerous. In Scripture it generally refers to rescue from God’s anger at the final judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to say what people are saved from. If that is true in your language, you should refer to destruction or punishment, that is, the results of sin. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to save/rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from destruction</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to save/rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the final judgment</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which frees them from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the great punishment of God</span></p></blockquote>",

Paul talks about God’s grace as if it were a person who teaches us. This is called “personification.” When people realize that God has shown great kindness and favor to them, they will behave in a new way as a result. Knowing God’s grace motivates them to reject evil ways (2:12a) and to behave in righteous ways (2:12b). So the grace of God acts as a teacher to these people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>It instructs us:</strong> In some languages it is possible to translate this literally: “God’s grace instructs us.” But in some languages it is impossible to use this sort of personification. If this is a problem in your language, you could translate like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>By showing us grace/kindness, God teaches us…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because God has shown us this kindness/favor, we are learning…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>us:</strong> Here this pronoun is inclusive and refers to Paul, Titus, and all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to renounce:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>renounce</em> means “deny, reject.” God’s grace teaches his people to reject all evil. It teaches them to stop behaving in ways that do not please God and to refuse to do the things that unbelievers do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ungodliness:</strong> This word refers to doing or saying things that show no reverence or respect for God. Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>having/showing disrespect for what is holy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>doing or saying things that dishonor/disrespect God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worldly passions:</strong> The phrase <em>worldly passions</em> refers to strong desires to have or do something related to this world. This could include desires for money, power, and improper sexual relationships. This is in contrast to the Holy Spirit and God’s desires for his people. Following these desires results in a person behaving in the way unbelievers behave. The thing the person wants is not always evil, but because the person wants it so much, it causes him to behave in a sinful way and controls the way he behaves.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>passions:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>passions</em> refers to strong desires of any kind. But in this context, it implies bad desires.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sinful/evil desires</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their inmost cravings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>lusts</p></blockquote><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives in the present age,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to live in a way that is wise, righteous, and pious at this present age/world.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Instead,</span> in this present time, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we learn</span> to behave in a sensible and right way, a way that honors/pleases God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives in the present age:</strong> In 2:12a, Paul mentioned two ways in which believers were <u>not</u> to behave, because of God’s grace. Now he gives three positive ways they are to behave instead.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sensible:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sensible</em> means “being sensible and moderate in one’s behavior.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida (88.94).</span></span> It describes a person who thinks and acts wisely and appropriately in various situations. This word is used in 1:8c to describe an overseer. It is also used in 2:2a, 2:5a, and 2:6. God’s grace causes the people of God to show restraint in their behavior and to think and act sensibly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>upright:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>upright</em> is often translated as “righteous” in the sense of “living the way we ought to live.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to do what is right (T4T)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live righteously</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live morally</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>godly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godly</em> means “in a devout and pious way.” Someone who lives a <em>godly</em> life is someone who submits himself to God and acts in ways that please God. See how you translated this word in 2 Timothy 3:12a 2TI3.12a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in a way that pleases God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>whatever pleases/honors God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the present age:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the present age</em> means “during this present time,” or “during these days” or “while we are living in this world.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in this world (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in this evil world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while we live in this world (EASY)</p></blockquote>",

It is also implied that believers are to live holy lives because they are waiting of the joyful event of Christ’s return. They should say no to sin while they are waiting for Christ to return, and, by implication, because they are waiting for Christ to return.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>waiting for our blessed hope (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as we wait for the blessed hope</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while we look forward with hope to that wonderful day (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We are filled with hope, as we wait for… (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We should live like that while we wait for our great hope (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> This pronoun is inclusive and refers to Paul, Titus, and all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>await:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>await</em> means to “welcome,” “receive,” “look forward with expectation” for something or some one. Christians know for certain that Christ will return and they are waiting for his return eagerly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the blessed hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>blessed</em> is often translated as “happy,” “fortunate,” or “favored.” In this context, the word highlights that this is a very special and significant hope that we as believers have. In some languages it may not be possible to describe an abstract idea like <em>hope</em> as <em>blessed</em>. Instead, it may be more natural to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the blessed Day we hope for (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the hope that brings blessing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the hope that makes us happy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> means “confident expectation,” that is, the state of waiting for and expecting something to happen that you are looking forward to. It does not mean that we doubt or wonder if it will happen. See the notes on <em>hope</em> at 1:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the idea of <em>hope</em> is expressed more clearly as a verb instead of a noun. As a verb it could be expressed like this: “while we wait for the blessed/wonderful event we are hoping for.” The event that we are hoping for is the return of Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while we look forward <u>with hope to that wonderful day</u> (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the happy fulfillment of our hope (NET, REB)</p></blockquote><h4>2:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the day when Jesus Christ, our great God and Savior, will return in all his greatness/majesty.</p></li><li><p>This hope is that Jesus Christ will appear again with great glory. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is</span> our great God and the one who saves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us from our sins</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ:</strong> This part of the verse gives the content of the “blessed hope” in 2:13a. The thing Christians hope for is Christ’s return.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glorious:</strong> The word <em>glorious</em> refers literally to a very bright light. In this context it refers to the greatness, splendor, and shining radiance that surrounds God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>majestic</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>great</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>appearance:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>appearance</em> here refers to the return of Jesus Christ. In some languages it will be easier to translate this as a verb form. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>at the time when he <u>appears</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he <u>returns</u> to earth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our great God and Savior Jesus Christ:</strong> Here Paul probably referred to Jesus Christ as both <em>our great God</em> and <em>our…Savior</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>When Paul talks about “the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ” in 2:13, he is not saying that <em>our great God</em> will appear, and that our <em>Savior Jesus Christ</em> will also appear. He is saying that Jesus Christ will appear, and he calls Jesus <em>our great God and Savior</em>.The reasons for understanding the phrase in this way are:1. Both the words <em>God</em> and <em>Savior</em> are in a phrase with just one article in Greek. (An article is the word in Greek that means “of the.”) This means that both <em>God</em> and <em>Savior</em> are joined together by that one grammatical article, and so refer to the same person.2. The New Testament does not teach that God the Father will come to earth and appear, but it does teach that Jesus will do this. The word translated as “appearance” is also used in other verses about Jesus coming to earth (see 1 Timothy 6:14, 2 Timothy 4:1, 8).3. The following verse (2:14) refers to Christ alone. So it is logical to assume that this verse (2:13) refers only to him.</span></span> Translate this in a way that makes this clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jesus Christ, who is our great God and Savior</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>our:</strong> This pronoun is inclusive and refers to all Christians, not just to Paul and Titus.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>great:</strong> Here the adjective <em>great</em> modifies the word “God” alone to emphasize even more the supreme greatness of God.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Savior:</strong> This word refers to someone who rescues people from danger. Jesus as <em>Savior</em> indicates that he rescues believers from the danger of God’s judgment against sinners.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate <em>Savior</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rescuer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the person who saves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us/you</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is the one who saves us from our sins. (EASY)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the person who saves/rescues <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin/death</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:13a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:13a our hope is mentioned, and in 2:13b the object of our hope is made more clear: Jesus Christ himself is our hope. The EASY translation makes this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are waiting <u>for Jesus Christ</u> to return to this world. When <u>he comes</u>, that will make us very happy. Everyone will see how great Jesus Christ is. He is our great God. He is the one who saves us from our sins. (EASY)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It may be helpful in your language to use shorter sentences, as in the EASY translation above. Another possibility is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Thatʼs how we should live as we wait for the blessed hope God has given us. We are waiting for Jesus Christ to appear in his glory. He is our great God and Savior. (NIrV)</p></blockquote></div>",

Jesus’ first purpose was to redeem <em>us</em>, that is, believers <em>from all lawlessness</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to free us from every kind of sin (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He gave himself to rescue us from every kind of evil (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to redeem us from all wickedness (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>redeem:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>redeem</em> refers to the process of freeing a slave. Here it is used in a figurative sense to refer to Jesus’ death as paying to set us free from the power of sin and death.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> The pronoun <em>us</em> is again inclusive of Paul, Titus, and all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from all lawlessness:</strong> Paul said that Jesus died to redeem us <em>from all lawlessness</em>. This probably means that Jesus has freed his people from having to do any kind of bad thing. They are free to do what is right and good.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>all lawlessness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>lawlessness</em> refers to not respecting or obeying God’s law. Some other ways to translate <em>all lawlessness</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>all wickedness (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>every sin (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>all evil (NIrV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to remove the sin/sins from/of his people. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">His purpose/will is</span> for us to belong to him</p></li><li><p>He wants to make for himself a pure people to be his own,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession:</strong> This is the second purpose for which Jesus died. He wanted to make for himself a pure people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The verb <em>purify</em> here refers here to purifying people from sin. God would forgive the people of their past sins and help them not to want to sin any more. It does not imply that he would wash their bodies. Translate this in a way that is clear in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and to make our hearts pure (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we can be completely good and clean inside ourselves (EASY)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a people for His own possession:</strong> Jesus cleanses people because he wants them to belong to him and to no one else.

He did not want anyone to say bad things about the word of God based on the behavior of Christians. He also encouraged Titus to let his own behavior be a good example for others. The reason to act in these ways is because the grace of God has appeared to us all, teaching us how to act while we wait for Jesus’ return.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1057002015\" data-endVerseId=\"1057002015\"><h3>Paragraph 2:15</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This next verse (2:15) is a summary statement. In most versions it forms a paragraph by itself. Paul had given Titus some detailed instructions to pass on to the believers and here he told Titus to teach these instructions with full authority.</p></div><h4>2:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Speak these things</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ So I want you to teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the believers</span> these things that I have written to you.</p></li><li><p>¶ So, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Titus,</span> make sure you teach these things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the people there in Crete</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Speak these things:</strong> It is possible to understand this as referring to either the things Paul had just told Titus or to what follows. However, most commentators agree that it refers back, that is, to the instructions in 2:2–14.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text more literally says “These things speak.” This is a direct command to Titus, an imperative. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You must teach these things (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Declare these things (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So communicate these things (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the believers</span> these things!

In some languages it may be natural to supply an object that refers to both these verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>encourage and rebuke <u>your hearers</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>encourage:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates <em>encourage</em> means to strengthen and comfort someone, generally by speaking kind words to them. In many languages it may be natural to supply an object, that is, indicate that Titus was to encourage the believers who lived in Crete.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used this same verb in 1:9b and 2:6 where the BSB translates it as “urge” (see the notes on these verses). It means that Titus was to urge the believers to do the things he was teaching them. Some languages have a figure of speech to communicate this. For example, “give liver and intestines”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>U̱t-Hun Back Translation.</span></span> is one cultural equivalent for encouraging.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>urge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>strengthen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people</span><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Nalik Back Translation, in progress.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Help them to live in a good way (EASY)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the believers</span> encouragement</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Speak good/kind words <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to them</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rebuke:</strong> To <em>rebuke</em> means to tell people when they are wrong and correct their wrong behavior. This is the same verb that Paul used in 1:13b. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to supply an object and indicate whom Titus was to encourage and rebuke. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tell <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span> what is wrong in their lives (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>correct <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the believers</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with all authority:</strong> Paul was reminding Titus that, as a church leader, Titus had the full right or authority to instruct the people under his care in spiritual things.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:15a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The words “with all authority” probably refer to Titus’ teaching in general, that is, to both encouraging and rebuking the believers under his care. It is good to make this clear in your translation. Here are some ways to translate 15a-b in a way that makes this clear:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Teach these things and use your full authority as you encourage and rebuke your hearers. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Teach these things, as you use your full authority to encourage and correct people.

It can involve ignoring that person and paying no attention to what he says. Paul wrote that Titus must not allow the people under his care to behave as if what he was teaching was unimportant. God had given him the authority to teach (2:15b), and so the people should respect him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No one should despise you. (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Make sure that everyone respects you properly.

They refer to government rulers, not church leaders. They include people like the king or president, district officials, village chiefs—anyone who has been appointed or elected as a leader of the community.

In 2:1–14, Paul had discussed relationships between Christians. Now in 3:1–11, he wrote about relationships that Christians have with non-Christians. He once more gave Titus instructions to pass on to the believers: they must submit to government authorities, be kind to other people, and not participate in useless arguments. God has given them new life because of what Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit have done, and they should live in peace and be generous to others.</p></div><h4>3:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For at one time we too were foolish, disobedient, misled,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Remind them to behave like this</span> because previously we<sup>(incl)</sup> were foolish, we disobeyed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> deceived us</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this</span> because there was a time when we ourselves were foolish, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just like unbelievers are now</span>, we did not obey, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> tricked us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">into behaving in the evil ways they taught</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> is a word that links this paragraph (3:3–7) back to the last paragraph (3:1–2). Paul had just told Titus (in 3:1–2) how the believers should behave and now (3:3–8) he gave the reasons why they should behave in that way, namely that God had been kind and loving to the believers while they were still evil, so now they should likewise be kind and loving to others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this transition word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because (T4T)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions do not translate this word. Do whatever is most natural in your own language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at one time:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>at one time</em> refers to an indefinite time in the past. In this context it means “the time before we became Christians” or “before we believed.” Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In the past (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Once (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we too were foolish:</strong> The Greek word the BSB translated as <em>foolish</em> means “stupid” or “without understanding.” In this context, it indicates that all these people did not understand spiritual matters.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we also were foolish (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we, like them, had no understanding <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God’s ways</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> The Greek pronoun the BSB translates as <em>we</em> here is inclusive: Paul included himself and Titus and the believers in Crete. He was as foolish as the Christians in Crete had been.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>too:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>too</em> here means “also, as well.” Paul and Titus, and the other believers, were all once ignorant of the gospel, just like the pagans among whom they lived, the “everyone” of 3:2c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>disobedient:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>disobedient</em> here indicates that these people did not obey instructions. See note on 1:16c where the same word is used.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not make explicit whose instructions these people failed to obey. Scholars suggest two options:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers specifically to disobeying God.</p></li><li><p>It means more general disobedience—disobeying both God and human authorities.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions leave this ambiguous. You should do the same if that is possible in your language. If, however, in your language you must say whom they were disobeying, it is recommended that you supply “God”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disobedient <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>did not obey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>misled:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>misled</em> is passive in form. Paul probably meant that before the Christians believed in Jesus, other people, or perhaps Satan, lied to them or deceived them to discourage them from believing. There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we were misled</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we ourselves were…led astray (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb and supplying a subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> lied to us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan</span> deceived us</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and enslaved to all sorts of desires and pleasures—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we could not stop doing all kinds of evil deeds that we wanted to do and that we enjoyed doing.</p></li><li><p>We were like slaves, controlled by a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continual</span> desire to do all the evil deeds we enjoyed doing.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and enslaved to all sorts of desires and pleasures:</strong> This verse part indicates that these people used to be slaves to <em>desires and pleasures</em>, that is, they were controlled by them. They were not free to behave in a different way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive clause and there are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>enslaved to various lusts and pleasures (NASB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>using an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and became slaves to many lusts and pleasures (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this using the verb form that is most natural in your language. In some languages it may be natural to leave the verb implied:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>slaves to various passions and pleasures</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all sorts of desires and pleasures:</strong> The Greek adjective that the BSB translates as <em>all sorts of</em> means “various.” It refers to both <em>desires</em> and <em>pleasures</em>. These desires and pleasures affected not just one area of life but many areas of life.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>desires:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>desires</em> implies a desire to do something evil or immoral, so it can also be translated “passions” or “lust.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>pleasures:</strong> This word is similar in meaning to “desires.” It refers to all kinds of enjoyable activities, illegal or immoral as well as legal and moral, whatever gives pleasure.</p><h4>3:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>living in malice and envy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We spent our time behaving in evil/wicked ways and envying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>.</p></li><li><p>We were mean/bad <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span> and we hated <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people who had advantages over us</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>living in malice and envy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>living in</em> means “passing our lives” or “spending our time.” Paul was saying that before people became Christians, they spent their time doing malicious and envious things. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>spending our life in malice and envy (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We spent our lives doing evil and being jealous. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our lives were full of evil and envy. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>malice:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>malice</em> is a general word referring to evil or wickedness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>envy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>envy</em> refers to the desire to possess something that someone else has, that is, the desire for your own well-being rather than that of the other person. This is the action forbidden by the Tenth Commandment, “You shall not covet.”</p><h4>3:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>being hated and hating one another.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We were hated <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by other people</span> and we hated each other too.</p></li><li><p>People hated us and we hated people too.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>being hated and hating one another:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB has translated as <em>being hated</em> is an adjective that describes something as worthy of hate, that is, hateful. There are several ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>others hated us</u> and we hated them (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>hateful (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>despicable (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this verse part:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We behaved in a way that caused people to hate us, and we hated one another.</p></blockquote>",

God has given them new life because of what Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit have done, and they should live in peace and be generous to others.</p></div><h4>3:4–7</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">After writing about the way that they used to live before they became Christians, Paul now reminded Titus that things had changed because of what God had done for them. He emphasized that God did not save them because of the good deeds they had done. He saved them because he was merciful.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verses 3:4–7 are one sentence in Greek, but probably you will need to use several sentences in your translation. See the General Comment at the end of 3:7.</p><h4>3:4</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Savior revealed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span> his kindness and his love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for us</span>,</p></li><li><p>However, God our Savior showed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> that he is kind and loves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us/everyone</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> What Paul was now going to say contrasts with 3:3. Before people became Christians, their state was as Paul had described it in 3:3. Now since God had saved them everything had changed for them. In English this contrast is shown by the use of <em>But</em>. Use whatever word or structure you use in your language to indicate this sort of contrast.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared:</strong> Most commentators think that Paul was referring here to God sending Jesus to earth. God showed his kindness and love to people by sending Jesus. In some languages it may not be possible to talk about abstract concepts like kindness and love <u>appearing</u>. In those languages it may be more natural to say that they <u>were revealed</u>, or that God showed them to us. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when God our Savior revealed his kindness and love (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when the kindness and love of God our Savior for humanity were revealed (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when the kindness and love of God our Savior was shown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to us</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God our Savior showed us how good and kind he is (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>kindness</em> means “goodness, generosity.” The Greek word translated as <em>love</em> has a similar meaning and refers to the love God has for people. In some languages it may be natural to translate both these abstract nouns as adjectives. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that he/God is kind and loving</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>how good and kind he is (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>God our Savior:</strong> This phrase refers to God as the one who saves/rescues us from sin and God’s wrath.</p>",

The pronoun <em>He</em> refers to God our Savior, from 3:4. The pronoun <em>us</em> refers to Paul, Titus, and all believers, all God’s people.</p><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not by the righteous deeds we had done,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this,</span> not because we had done righteous works/things</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do this</span> because of anything good that we had done.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not by the righteous deeds we had done:</strong> This verse part explains that God did not save his people on the grounds of any good works that they had done. Their righteous acts were not the cause of or reason for their salvation. They did nothing to contribute to it. Their salvation is not a reward for their good deeds.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it was not because of any upright actions we had done ourselves (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not on the basis of deeds which we did in righteousness (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not because we had done righteous deeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He did not save us because of any righteous things we had done</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It wasn’t because of the good things we had done. (NIrV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteous deeds we had done:</strong> This phrase is more literally “works that we did in righteousness.” Paul did not make it clear whether or not people had in fact ever done any <em>righteous deeds</em>. Try to leave this open or ambiguous. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>any good deeds that we have done</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>good things we might have done</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>righteous deeds:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>righteous deeds</em> refers to behaving or acting in righteous ways, deeds done in obedience to God’s laws. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>upright actions (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>good works/deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>things that are good in God’s sight</p></blockquote><h4>3:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but according to His mercy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but because he had compassion <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on us</span>.</p></li><li><p>Rather, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he did this,</span> because he is merciful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but according to His mercy:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> here introduces a strong contrast. Paul now gave the real or true reason why God acted to save us. The reason was his own mercy. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rather, he saved us because he had mercy on us.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>No, it was because of his mercy that he saved us.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His mercy:</strong> This phrase refers to God’s <em>mercy</em>, that is, God’s compassion for us. In some languages it may be natural to translate this as a clause with a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God had mercy on us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God showed us kindness</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:5a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be natural to reorder the information in these verse parts and put the positive statement first (5c) and the negative second (5b). God saved us because of his mercy. It was not because of our good deeds that he saved us. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>He saved us <sup>5c</sup>because of his mercy. <sup>5b</sup>It was not because of the righteous things that we had done.</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He did this by washing us, so giving us new birth, and by renewing us by the Holy Spirit.</p></li><li><p>We received this salvation/deliverance because he cleansed us and in this way gave us new life, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because he gave us</span> the Holy Spirit to cause us to live in a new way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit:</strong> In Greek this complex phrase can be understood in a number of different ways. Here are the main options:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Holy Spirit is <u>the agent of one action</u>, <em>renewal</em>. God saved people by means of two things: the washing of new birth and the renewal that was given or caused by the Holy Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the washing of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Holy Spirit is <u>the agent of two actions</u> (<em>new birth</em>, <em>renewal</em>). God saved people by means of one thing: washing them. This washing can be explained or understood as the new birth and renewal of the Holy Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the washing in which the Holy Spirit gives us new birth and renewal (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Holy Spirit is <u>the agent of three actions</u> (<em>washing</em>, <em>new birth</em>, <em>renewal</em>). God saved people through these three actions of the Holy Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>through the Holy Spirit, who gives us new birth and new life by washing us (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">All these options have wide support among scholars, and all can be defended from the Greek sentence structure. Some English translations (such as the BSB) are ambiguous or unclear. These Notes and Display follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3:5 See Knight, The Pastoral Epistles.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>through:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>through</em> here introduces the means by which God saves people. Following interpretation (1) above, there are two means: “washing of rebirth” and “renewal by the Holy Spirit.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3:5 The Greek text does not contain the definite article “the” anywhere in this phrase. It has been supplied by the BSB. In some languages it may be best to omit it.</span></span> So in some languages it may be natural to repeat the word <em>through</em> and translate the entire phrase as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>through washing of rebirth and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">through</span> renewal by/of the Holy Spirit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the washing of new birth:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>washing</em> here means “cleansing.” It probably refers to inward cleansing, that is, to purifying people from sin. This washing or cleansing is symbolized by baptism. The phrase <em>washing of new birth</em> probably identifies <em>washing</em> as a <em>new birth</em>, that is, inward cleansing is a kind of rebirth, or results in new birth. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cleansing us, causing us to receive new birth</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>new birth:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translated as <em>new birth</em> means “new beginning.” This word also occurs in Matthew to refer to the new creation. In this context it refers to the new beginning in someone’s life when they receive new life and become a Christian. Other NT writers use the figure of speech “born again” to refer to the event of becoming a Christian (John 3:3; 1 Peter 1:3, 1:23). If you have already translated these passages, check the expression you used there before deciding what to do here. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God gave us new birth/life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God enabled us to begin to live in a new way</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>God caused us to follow a new path</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>renewal:</strong> The Greek word the BSB translates as <em>renewal</em> means “new beginning” in the sense of “a fresh start.” This word also occurs in Romans 12:2. In this context it has a similar meaning to “new birth.” The difference between the two is that the word for “new birth” indicates the starting point of new life, and the word for <em>renewal</em> refers to the new type of life that results from that new birth. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>new life (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>making us/believers new people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by the Holy Spirit:</strong> As described in the note earlier in this verse part, scholars do not agree as to which action or actions Paul was referring as performed <em>by the Holy Spirit</em>. It is recommended that you translate this as referring to the action of “renewal,” that is, the Holy Spirit is the one who renews God’s people.</p>",

God has given them new life because of what Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit have done, and they should live in peace and be generous to others.</p></div><h4>3:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is the Spirit He poured out on us abundantly</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He caused this/his Holy Spirit to stream/come down on us in full measure</p></li><li><p>God gave us the Holy Spirit richly/abundantly</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is the Spirit He poured out on us abundantly:</strong> In Greek the sentence continues here using a pronoun that refers to the Holy Spirit. In some languages it may be natural to make this reference explicit and begin a new sentence here, as does the BSB. More examples:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God poured out the Spirit generously</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God caused this Holy Spirit to descend upon us in abundance/fullness/richness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>He poured out:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>poured out</em> is a figure of speech that describes the way God gave the Holy Spirit to his people. This same figure of speech is used in Acts 2:17–18, 33. To “pour out” something is to let it flow or come down. This figure of speech indicates that God caused the Holy Spirit to come down, descend, upon his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>abundantly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>abundantly</em> means “richly, in full measure.” In this context it indicates that God gave the Holy Spirit to believers without holding back, that is, fully or completely. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in God’s great generosity</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>generously</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely</p></blockquote><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>through Jesus Christ our Savior,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>through our<sup>(incl)</sup> Savior Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the work of</span> Jesus Christ, the one who saves us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through Jesus Christ our Savior:</strong> This “pouring out” of the Holy Spirit (3:6a) was done <em>through Jesus Christ our Savior</em>. Commentators understand this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The life and death of Jesus saved us and made it possible for God to pour out the Holy Spirit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He generously poured out the Spirit upon us because of what Jesus Christ our Savior did.

(CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both of these statements are true. Paul may have had either or both in mind. If you must choose between them, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1), since Paul referred to Jesus Christ as <em>our Savior</em>.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:6a-b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to reorder these parts.

In 2:1–14, Paul had discussed relationships between Christians. Now in 3:1–11, he wrote about relationships that Christians have with non-Christians. He once more gave Titus instructions to pass on to the believers: they must submit to government authorities, be kind to other people, and not participate in useless arguments. God has given them new life because of what Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit have done, and they should live in peace and be generous to others.</p></div><h4>3:7a-c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two main ways to understand the structure of 3:7a-c:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The words “having been justified” indicate the <u>basis or grounds</u> for God making us his heirs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And so, since we have been justified by his grace, we become heirs with the confident expectation of eternal life (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, ESV, KJV, NASB, NET, NRSV, REB, NCV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The words “having been justified” are part of God’s <u>purpose</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that we might be justified by his grace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and become heirs in hope of eternal life (NABRE) <em>(CEV, GNT, GW, NLT, RSV, NABRE, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), which has the strongest commentary support.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>3:7 See the following commentaries: NIVAC, NIGTC, CBC, AYB, ICC, PNTC, NICNT, REBC.</span></span> God’s main purpose for saving us and giving us the Holy Spirit was to make us his heirs (3:7b). The action talked about in the words “having been justified by his grace” is another way of referring to the action “he saved us” in 3:5a and 5d. That is, God “justified” us when he saved us and before he made us his “heirs.” Make this clear in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God did this and</span> <sup>7a</sup>declared us righteous in order that <sup>7b</sup>we might become his heirs/children <sup>7c</sup>and have the hope/expectation to live forever.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God saved us,</span> <sup>7a</sup>declaring us right with him, in order that <sup>7c</sup>we might become his heirs/children <sup>7c</sup>and confidently expect to live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with him</span> forever.</p></blockquote><h4>3:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that, having been justified by His grace,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So by his grace/kindness to us, God has declared us<sup>(incl)</sup> to be righteous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in his sight</span></p></li><li><p>Therefore, because God has chosen to be kind to us and make/put us right with him,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> here introduces a purpose clause. It indicates God’s purpose, that is, the result that God intended when he saved us (3:5d) and/or poured out his Spirit on us (3:6b). In Greek the same sentence continues throughout 3:4–7 and it is hard to be sure which idea was primary for Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">God’s purpose or intended result is given in 3:7b-c (<em>so that</em> “…we might become heirs, having the hope of eternal life”). See the note on 3:7a-c above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to begin a new sentence here. If that is the case in your language, you could begin with a general introductory phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God did this</span> so that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>having been justified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>having been justified</em> means “declared just” or “made right with God.” See how you translated this in Romans 2:13b, 3:24a, 5:1a, and 8:30b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a passive verb and there are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Using a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>put right with God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>declared righteous</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>being made right with God (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using an active verb with God supplied as the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God…has given us his approval (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has acquitted us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of our sins</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God said to us, “I no longer hold you guilty of the sins you have committed.”</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by His grace:</strong> This phrase indicates that God was gracious and generous. He declared us just and made us right with him. We did nothing to deserve or earn that. Other ways to translate this include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in his kindness (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because of his grace (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we would become heirs</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we have become his children</p></li><li><p>we have the position of sons/children</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we would become heirs:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>we would become heirs</em> gives the purpose for which God saved us and gave us his Holy Spirit (5d). The phrase “so that” from 3:7a is connected to this clause. This was <u>God’s</u> purpose or intended result, and so it certainly will take place.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> This pronoun is inclusive. Paul included himself, Titus, and the believers in Crete and elsewhere.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heirs:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>heirs</em> is a figure of speech. It indicates that, just as children can expect to inherit things from their parents, so a person who becomes God’s child can expect to receive eternal life from him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Christians are often called God’s <em>heirs</em> (see Romans 8:17, Galatians 4:7, Hebrews 6:17, James 2:5). Try to translate this idea in the same way in each of these passages.</p><h4>3:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with the hope of eternal life.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and confidently expect to live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with him</span> forever.</p></li><li><p>and we are waiting for him to give us eternal life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with the hope of eternal life:</strong> The Greek is more literally “according to the hope of eternal life.” As God’s heirs (3:7b), believers can confidently expect to receive the <em>eternal life</em> that God has promised to give them. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in hope of eternal life (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who have the confidence that we have everlasting life (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> refers to a confident hope or expectation. Believers wait for God to give them eternal life, trusting that that is what he will do. Since it is God’s purpose in saving them, it will certainly happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal life:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>eternal life</em> refers to life forever with God. This can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the life that never ends (NCV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:7a-c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse has a complicated grammatical structure, and there are a number of ways of understanding exactly how the different phrases fit together. The basic meaning is that since believers are saved and justified by grace, they are God’s heirs, and as God’s heirs they can confidently expect that they will receive eternal life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate and connect these verse parts:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that by his grace we might be put right with God and come into possession of the eternal life we hope for (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so, since we have been justified by his grace, we become heirs with the confident expectation of eternal life. (NET)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:4–7</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek 3:4–7 forms one long sentence. In many languages it may be natural to break this up into several shorter sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4</sup>When God our Savior revealed his kindness and love, <sup>5</sup>he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit. <sup>6</sup>He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior. <sup>7</sup>Because of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life. (NLT)</p></blockquote></div>",

It concludes the teachings in 3:4–7 with an assurance that these teachings are true and a command to Titus to emphasize them. Then, in 3:8d, Paul said that these teachings were “excellent and profitable,” in contrast with the “foolish” and “pointless” teachings he would talk about in 3:9–11.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Different translations start the new paragraph at different places. Because this paragraph is a link between two other paragraphs, it may be best to make it a paragraph by itself, as a number of English versions have done (for example, GNT, NCV).

It does not refer to just one word or one statement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trustworthy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>trustworthy</em> means “reliable,” “sure,” “certain to be true,” “something you can trust.” Paul was telling Titus that he could depend on and trust what he has just told him.</p><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And I want you to emphasize these things,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And I want you to place emphasis on these matters <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when you teach people</span></p></li><li><p>You should keep on emphasizing them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And I want you:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>And I want you</em> is a way of introducing a request or polite command.

Other commentators think that the false teachers studied lists of names of angels and other supernatural beings that they thought could help them reach God.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul spoke to Timothy about a similar problem with genealogies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>arguments, and quarrels about the law:</strong> The <em>law</em> here refers to the Jewish law, the law that God gave to Moses. The words <em>arguments</em> and <em>quarrels</em> are similar in meaning. Both words refer to fighting with words, not physical fighting. If your language does not have two words for <em>arguments</em> and <em>quarrels</em> you can combine them and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>arguments about the Jewish law</p></blockquote><h4>3:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because these things are pointless and worthless.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are not helpful or useful.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Avoid these arguments</span> because they do not help anyone.

Also, you may want to repeat the main verb “avoid.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Avoid these arguments because they do not help anyone and are useless.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>because:</strong> The word <em>because</em> here introduces the reason why Titus must avoid meaningless arguments. He must avoid them <em>because</em> they do not help anyone and they are of no use.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pointless:</strong> The word <em>pointless</em> means “of no help.” Things that are <em>pointless</em> do not help us to grow in the Christian faith. This is the opposite of the word translated as “profitable” in 3:8d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they do not help us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to grow in the faith</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>nothing is gained from them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>worthless:</strong> The word <em>worthless</em> means “useless” or “futile.” It is similar in meaning to “pointless.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>useless</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>empty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a waste of time (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

You should connect these verses in a way that is natural in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our people should <u>also</u> learn how to set an example by doing good things (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>And</u> our own people must be taught to devote themselves to good works (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>And our people must also learn:</strong> Paul implied that someone must teach the believers.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Our people must be taught</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>And our people:</strong> This phrase refers to the Christian believers on Crete.

Paul said that the Christians must learn to give their full attention to doing good works.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>to good works:</strong> The Greek phrase is literally “to engage in good works” (see the notes on 2:7a). Doing <em>good works</em> is one of the main themes of this letter.
