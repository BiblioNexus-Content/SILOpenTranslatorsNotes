Consider also how closely you should follow that in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings from James (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greeting (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>James writes to the Jewish Christians</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> James, a servant/slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> James, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> serve God and Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> Lord/Master.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I who write this am</span> James.

So James began this letter with his own name. However, in some languages, starting with James’ name will not make it clear that James was the writer of the letter. It may be necessary to say this explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This letter is from James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is not usual for a person to talk about himself in the third person. In these languages, it may be necessary to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> James, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter. I am</span> a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> James. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing this letter to you. I am</span> a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>James:</strong> <em>James</em> was one of Jesus’ younger brothers. He was also one of the leaders of the church in Jerusalem. He is mentioned in Matthew 13:55, Mark 6:3, and various other places in the NT. It is important to spell the name <em>James</em> the same way here as you did in those passages.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information about James, see the section called “The person who wrote the letter” in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a servant of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>servant</em> also means “slave.” This normally refers to someone who was owned by another person. He worked for his owner without receiving pay.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>servant of God</em> (or more often “servant of the Lord”) is often used figuratively in the Old Testament to describe the relationship that God’s people have to him, their master. It refers to someone who submits to God, serves God, and is devoted and loyal to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">People often despised servants or slaves. But when someone called himself <em>a servant of God,</em> as James did here, he was not ashamed of it. If you have more than one word to describe servants or slaves, choose the one that is most appropriate to be used in this positive sense that describes a believer’s relationship to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a slave of God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a worker of/for God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be best to translate the word <em>servant</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> serve God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>belong to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>submit to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and of the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> James also called himself a servant <em>of the Lord Jesus Christ.</em></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means someone who has authority over someone or something. Here it is a title that identifies Jesus as God, the one who has supreme authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>Lord</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Master</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Owner</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>supreme Chief/Leader</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to add a word like “our” before <em>Lord.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span> Master/Chief</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For further suggestions on translating Lord in James, see Lord in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is sometimes used as a title and sometimes as a name. Even when it is used as a name, it has the same meaning that it has as a title. Here in James, the word <em>Christ</em> probably functions as a title more than as a name.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is based on the position taken in these Notes that James addressed this letter to Jewish Christians for whom the title “Christ” (or “Messiah”) would have had significant meaning. It is also based on an assumed early date for the book of James (sometime between AD 50 and AD 62), a time before “Christ” came to be established as a name. See, for example, McCartney, page 79, and the Translator’s Handbook, page 8, (which agrees that “Christ” would have been a title to early Christians of Jewish background though the Handbook takes the position that James wrote to Christians in general, Jewish and Gentile alike).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title <em>Christ</em> is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word “Messiah.” The Jews used this title to refer to the person whom God had appointed and promised to send as king and savior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>Christ</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a title or a descriptive phrase in your language that has the same meaning as <em>Christ.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Messiah</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Promised Deliverer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Rescuer-King whom God appointed</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate <em>Christ</em> and include a phrase that explains the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ, the appointed one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cristo, the Savior whom God promised to send</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Christ, he comes from God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Transliterate <em>Christ</em> and indicate in some way that it is a title. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Kirisita</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not indicate the meaning of <em>Christ</em> in the text, you may want to include a footnote to explain it. Or you may want to explain the meaning in a glossary. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word/title “Christ” refers to the one whom God had promised to send. He would be both king and savior.</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the twelve tribes of the Dispersion: Greetings.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>greet <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> twelve tribes/clans <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Israel</span> scattered outside <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> homeland.</p></li><li><p>I greet <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> Jewish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are</span> living in other countries.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the twelve tribes of the Dispersion: Greetings:</strong> In some languages, it may be natural to place the word <em>Greetings</em> before the phrase saying whom James was greeting. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings to the twelve tribes scattered all over the world. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may also be necessary to use a verb that means “greets” rather than the noun <em>Greetings.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I greet the twelve tribes scattered among the nations</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I say “hello” to you twelve tribes scattered among the nations</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>To the twelve tribes of the Dispersion:</strong> Most scholars interpret the phrase <em>the twelve tribes</em> to refer to Christians.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A small group of scholars say that James was writing to all Jews. For more information, see the section called “The people to whom James wrote” in the Introduction.</span></span> However, there are two ways to interpret which Christians this phrase refers to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>Jewish Christians</u> who were scattered in other countries. The <em>twelve tribes</em> was a common way to refer to the Jews. Here it refers to Jews who were Christians. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am writing to the “twelve tribes”—Jewish believers scattered abroad.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>both Jewish and Gentile Christians</u>. Certain passages describe Christians as true or spiritual Israel. (See, for example, Galatians 3:7 and Galatians 3:29). Christians are <em>of the Dispersion</em> in the sense that they do not live in heaven which is their true homeland. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to all God’s people scattered over the whole world <em>(GNT, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate this phrase literally and do not make it clear to whom the phrase refers. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>We are following a majority of Bible scholars, though opinion is split on this issue.</span></span> and make this interpretation clear either in the text or in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Make it explicit that the phrase <em>the twelve tribes</em> refers to the twelve tribes “of Israel.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to the twelve tribes/clans of Israel who are scattered among the nations</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to the people of Israel who are scattered among the nations <em>If you do this, you should include a footnote to explain that the twelve tribes refers to Jewish Christians.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make it explicit that the phrase <em>the twelve tribes</em> refers to Jewish Christians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to Jewish believers who are scattered among the nations</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the twelve tribes:</strong> The phrase <em>the twelve tribes</em> refers to the descendants of Jacob’s twelve sons, whom God renamed as Israel. These people all spoke the same language and all considered themselves to belong to the same ethnic group.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is more natural to call them:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>clans</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sections/divisions</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>of the Dispersion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the Dispersion</em> refers to certain times during the Jews’ history, when they had been forced to flee from their country. Many of them still lived in other (non-Jewish) countries. These are the people who would normally be referred to as <em>the Dispersion.</em></p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, James was probably writing to Jewish Christians. So he might also have meant the Jewish believers who had been forced to leave Jerusalem because they had been persecuted for their faith. See Acts 11:19 for an example.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>Dispersion</em> means that these people were living outside of their country or home areas. It does not mean that these people were living far apart from each other.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dispersed throughout the world (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spread outside of their homeland</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>living in other countries</p></blockquote>",

These trials are a test of their faith (1:2–4). They need God’s wisdom in order to remain faithful to him, and so they should pray for wisdom (1:5). When they come to God in prayer, they should have an attitude of firm trust in him (1:6–8). Both poverty and wealth test a Christian. They should trust God whether rich or poor and learn to think about poverty and wealth as God does (1:9–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Have faith and wisdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When you have trials/tests, you must trust God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be joyful when your faith is tested</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060001002\" data-endVerseId=\"1060001004\"><h3>Paragraph 1:2–4</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">James taught that Christians should rejoice when persons or situations test their faith.

Make sure it is clear to your readers that the expression <em>my brothers</em> refers to the same people as “the twelve tribes” in 1:1b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Consider it pure joy:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Consider it pure joy</em> is literally “Consider it all joy” (as in the NASB). This means “Regard trials as something to rejoice about” or “Think of trials as occasions for joy.” This refers to joy with no sadness mixed with it at all. James wanted his readers to think about their trials as positive events that God allowed for their good.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be very happy (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be glad (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let it be an opportunity for joy (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my brothers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>brothers</em> is the term commonly used in the New Testament to refer to other believers in Jesus. This term emphasizes that all believers belonged to God’s family. James used this term to identify with his audience and to show his closeness with all believers. You may have a different term of address in your language which establishes a feeling of closeness with your audience. If so, consider using it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Although James used a masculine form, he was not intending to exclude women. In your translation, you should use a word or phrase that does not exclude women.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my fellow believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My brothers and sisters (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my relatives/siblings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my Christian friends</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">James tended to use a term of address (like <em>my brothers</em>) when he was introducing a new topic. Here he introduced the topic of trials. You may have another natural way in your language to introduce a new topic. If you do, you could use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the BSB places the phrase <em>my brothers</em> in the middle of 1:2. This follows the Greek text. If it is more natural in your language to place it at the beginning or end of the sentence or verse, consider doing that here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My brothers and sisters, be very happy… (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when you encounter trials of many kinds,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when you<sup>(plur)</sup> encounter all kinds of tests,</p></li><li><p>when you<sup>(plur)</sup> have all sorts of problems/troubles that test your faith.</p></li><li><p>when all kinds of trials/difficulties come to you.<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when you encounter trials of many kinds:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>encounter</em> means “experience.” Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whenever you face trials of many kinds (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you encounter various trials (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when all kinds of trials come your way (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trials of many kinds:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>trials of many kinds</em> refers to various types of difficult situations that occur in a person’s life and test his faith. These can include both external problems<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The following commentators interpret <em>πειρασμοῖς </em>as referring primarily to problems and difficulties: Mayor, page 32; Ropes, pages 133–134; Davids (1982), page 37; Hiebert, page 72; Laws, page 51; Moo (1985), pages 59–60; Martin, page 15.</span></span> like persecution and internal temptations<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The following commentators interpret <em>πειρασμοῖς </em>as applying primarily to temptations or assaults of evil: Alford, page 275; Huther (but doubtfully), pages 41–42; Mitton, page 19; Adamson (1976), page 53: “trying assaults of evil.”</span></span> from Satan.

Williams “remember.” The German versions Luther 1964 revision, 1984 revision (but not 1975 revision), and <em>Zürcher Bibel,</em> and the French version <em>Bible de la Pléiade </em>translate with an imperative (which could be translated as “and recognize that”). Hiebert states (page 74): “The present tense participle indicates that his readers were not ignorant of the truth being set forth, but they had to continue to realize it in personal experience.” However, the following commentators support the interpretation of the BSB: Alford, page 275; Davids (1982), page 68; Martin, page 15.

They needed wisdom from God to know what to do while experiencing trials that test their faith. God will answer this prayer if they fully trust God when they pray. But if they do not fully trust him or if they have divided loyalty, God will not answer their prayers.</p></div><h4>1:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now if any of you lacks wisdom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ If any of you<sup>(plur)</sup> does not have wisdom,</p></li><li><p>¶ Anyone who is not wise</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now if any of you lacks wisdom:</strong> This clause is in the form of an “if” statement, but James was not wondering if anyone lacked wisdom. He knew that all his readers needed wisdom in order to be successful in enduring trials (1:2).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If a literal translation of <em>if</em> would make your readers think that James did not know if anyone needed wisdom, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Those of you who need wisdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He who does not have wisdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lacks:</strong> The word <em>lacks</em> here indicates that a person does not have wisdom or does not have enough wisdom.

A person who has <em>wisdom</em> is one who chooses to behave the way God wants. He acts wisely. When he is tempted to behave in the wrong way, he resists.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to translate this word as an adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If any of you is not wise enough</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If any of you needs to become a wiser person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If any of you needs understanding to do what is right and good</p></blockquote><h4>1:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he should ask God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> should ask God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give you some</span>.</p></li><li><p>should ask God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to make him wise</span>, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will help/teach him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he should ask God:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>he should ask</em> is a command addressed to the person who needs wisdom.

This is the person whom James referred to in 1:5a. Depending on how you have translated 1:5a, it may be necessary to use the pronoun “you” “we<sup>(incl)</sup>” or “they” rather than “he.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>you</u> should ask God (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>they</u> should ask God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>we</u> <sup>(incl)</sup> should request God</p></blockquote><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who gives generously to all without finding fault,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God gives abundantly to everyone without blaming <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For</span> God is generous.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For</span> God gives generously to all without finding fault.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be natural to begin a new sentence here because:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>1:5a–d is a long sentence in both the Greek and the BSB, and it may be natural in your language to divide it into several shorter sentences.</p></li><li><p>a clause beginning with the word “who” might imply that one God gives generously and another God does not give generously.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gives generously:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>generously</em> means that God gives “without hesitation,” “freely,” and “unconditionally.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gives without reserve</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gives bountifully</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language needs to say what God gives, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>generously gives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good things</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>abundantly gives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what we need</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to all:</strong> The word <em>all</em> here refers to all people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>without finding fault:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>without finding fault</em> means “does not criticize, reproach, or blame.” God does not criticize those who ask him for wisdom, because he is pleased that they have come to him for help.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without scolding (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He will not resent your asking.

The verb <em>will be given</em> is passive. God is the one who gives wisdom. So there are at least two ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wisdom will be given/granted him</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will give you wisdom (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will cause him to become wise.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, “wisdom” is not something that “is given.” Some other ways to translate the word <em>given</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God will <u>teach</u> him to be wise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God will <u>help</u> him to be wise</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:5a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">One of the challenges in translating 1:5 is to decide how to connect the “who” clause in 1:5c to the rest of the verse.

He must be firmly committed to God and to Jesus as the Messiah. He must not trust anyone else or anything else, and he must not waver in his commitment.

He must not be uncertain whether God will give him wisdom or not. For example, the NLT96 says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>be sure that you really expect him to answer <em>(NLT96)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous, and there is good support among the commentators for both interpretations.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) is supported by Mayor, page 39 (he compares 4:4 and Matthew 6:24); Ropes, page 140; Hiebert, page 84; Davids (1982), page 73; Moo (1985), page 64; Mitton, page 31; Tasker, page 42.Interpretation (2) is supported by Alford, page 277; Huther, page 50; Adamson (1976), pages 57–58; Laws, page 57.</span></span> So if you can leave your translation ambiguous here, you should do so. However, if you must make a choice, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Interpretation (1) fits well with the idea of “the testing of your faith” in 1:3b. It also fits well with the description of the person as “double-minded and unstable in all his ways” in 1:8a–b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he must firmly trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God/Jesus</span> and not doubt/waver</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he must trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God/Jesus</span> without any hesitation</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the note on “your faith” at 1:3b and see believe, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that <em>in faith, without doubting</em> is another positive statement followed by its negative restatement (See the note on “not lacking anything” at 1:4c.). Together they emphasize that complete faith is necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this expression is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>truly believe/trust</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>without doubting:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>doubting</em> can also be translated as “wavering.” It means “continue to change one’s mind or commitment.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Though most English versions translate with the word “doubt,” many commentators explain the meaning as having to do with a wavering allegiance to God or Jesus. See, for example, Davids (1982), page 73; Lenski, page 530–531; Moo (2000), page, 60–61; McCartney, page 90–91 ; and Ropes, page 140–141. McCartney in particular says: “James does not mean that a believer may never have a measure of uncertainty regarding whether something is God’s will; rather, he is condemning a lack of commitment, a divided loyalty, or an indecision or hesitancy that questions the integrity of God.” (91). David DeGraaf argues that the Greek word <em>διακρινω </em>never refers to intellectual uncertainty in his article “Some Doubts about Doubt: The New Testament Use of <em>Διακρινω.</em>” (Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 48:733–755)</span></span> This refers to not being firm and constant in one’s commitment to trust Jesus as God’s Messiah.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>nothing wavering (KJV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not waver <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in his trust/commitment</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not continually changing his mind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about trusting Jesus</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not have two minds/hearts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about this</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For anyone who wavers is like an ocean wave that the wind blows and tosses around.</p></li><li><p>He who continues to change his mind about this is as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unstable/unreliable as</span> the rough water of the sea/lake that the wind blows back and forth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The conjunction <em>because</em> introduces the basis for James’ command in 1:6b. A person who asks God for something must believe and not doubt/waver (1:6a–b), <u>because</u> he who doubts/wavers is like a wave (1:6c).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, no conjunction is necessary to introduce the basis for James’ command.

In this simile, a person who doubts/wavers is compared to a wave. They are similar in that neither one is stable. A wave is never stable or still because the wind blows it around in different directions. A person who wavers is not stable because he keeps changing his mind about what he believes.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to translate this simile is to make explicit how a person who doubts/wavers is similar to a wave. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person with divided loyalty is <u>as unsettled</u> as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the person who wavers <u>is always changing what he believes</u>. He is like a wave <u>that always changes</u> as it is blown and tossed by the wind</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a wave of the sea:</strong> The phrase <em>a wave of the sea</em> refers to the action of the water in a sea moving up and down, and back and forth in relation to the surface.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Describe waves. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the moving of the water on the sea/lake</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the constantly changing water of the sea</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the swells of water in a sea</p></blockquote></li><li><p>In areas where waves and the sea are well-known, the word <em>wave</em> may include the idea of sea. It may not be necessary to add the phrase <em>of the sea.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wave</p></blockquote></li><li><p>In areas where there are no large bodies of water, it may be possible to translate this phrase simply as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>water</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blown and tossed by the wind:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>blown</em> and <em>tossed</em> are passive. There are at least two ways to translate them:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>blown and tossed around by the wind (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use active verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that the wind blows and throws around</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be more natural to use one expression for the two verbs in the phrase <em>blown and tossed by the wind.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that the wind blows in every direction</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The wind causes the waves of the sea to go in every direction</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tossed around in a storm (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>blown:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>blown</em> refers to the way the wind can move and lift the surface of the water in many different directions.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>tossed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tossed</em> is similar in meaning to the word translated as <em>blown.</em> The picture is of the water being thrown into the air by the wind.</p>",

These trials are a test of their faith (1:2–4). They need God’s wisdom in order to remain faithful to him, and so they should pray for wisdom (1:5). When they come to God in prayer, they should have an attitude of firm trust in him (1:6–8). Both poverty and wealth test a Christian. They should trust God whether rich or poor and learn to think about poverty and wealth as God does (1:9–11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Have faith and wisdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When you have trials/tests, you must trust God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be joyful when your faith is tested</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060001009\" data-endVerseId=\"1060001011\"><h3>Paragraph 1:9–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Even if a Christian has a low position in society, he can rejoice. He can rejoice because, in God’s opinion, he is in a high position. Similarly, a Christian who is rich should have God’s opinion about himself. Although rich people are generally given high status because of their riches, rich Christians should rather value a low position and humble attitude. They should remember that our lives on earth are short and that riches will not last.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The theme of section 1:2–11 is that Christians should continue to trust God/Jesus when they have various kinds of tests/trials. Poverty is a kind of trial. It is also the result of the trial of being persecuted. Riches too may be a kind of test of faith. They test whether the Christian will trust God or his money. And for rich Christians who had lost wealth and status because of their faith in Christ, they should think of this in a positive way.</p></div><h4>1:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But the one who is rich should exult in his low position,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But a rich <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believer</span> should be glad that he is lowered/humbled <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by God</span>,</p></li><li><p>But rich <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> should rejoice when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> humbles them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But the one who is rich:</strong> The clause <em>But the one who is rich</em> contrasts with 1:9. However, there are two ways to interpret the clause <em>the one who is rich:</em></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to <u>believers</u> who are rich, in contrast to the ones who are poor (1:9). James was warning rich believers not to put their confidence in or highly value riches. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the rich Christians <em>(GNT, REB, GW, CEV and probably BSB, NIV, NLT, NCV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mayor, pages 43–44; Ropes, pages 145–146; Mitton, pages 36–37; Adamson (1976), page 61; Hiebert, pages 91–92; Moo (1985), page 68; Lenski, page 534; Tasker, page 43.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>unbelievers</u>. James was speaking about rich people who were generally evil and not believers in Jesus, like the ones described in James 2:6–7 and 5:1–6. He said that they will be condemned. For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the rich man <em>(NASB, NET)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, page 278; Huther, pages 55–56; Laws, pages 62–64; Davids (1982), pages 76–77; Martin, pages 25–26; Dibelius, pages 84–85, Stulac, pages 190–201.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English translations can be understood either way (ESV, RSV, NJB, KJV, JBP). The choice between interpretation (1) and (2) is very difficult. Some translators may prefer to translate in a way that can be understood as either (1) or (2). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rich (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rich people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must choose one interpretation, or if you prefer to choose one interpretation, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Most English versions and many commentators follow that interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to make it clear that <em>the one who is rich</em> is also a brother are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rich brother</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Rich believers (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rich Christians (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the one:</strong> Like “the brother” in 1:9a, <em>the one</em> here refers to rich believers in general. Consider whether it is more natural to use a singular or plural term here in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>should exult:</strong> The phrase <em>should exult</em> does not occur in Greek. However, it is clear from the parallel structure in 1:9b that readers should understand the same phrase here. So the BSB has supplied these words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As noted in 1:9b, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>should exult</em> often means “boast.” But the Bible teaches that we should “boast” or “highly value” things that people generally have a low opinion of. Some of these things are weakness (2 Corinthians 12:5), knowing God (Jeremiah 9:24), and sufferings (Romans 5:3). Here James says that rich believers should “think well of” or “highly value” their low position.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be glad (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>think well/highly of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>highly value</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rejoice</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, use the same word for both the lowly brother (1:9b) and for the rich brother.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in his low position:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in his low position</em> refers to:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>a humble attitude. God causes rich men to become humble so they understand that they need him to save them. Rich believers also become humble as they realize that their wealth does not make them important. They learn to highly value things that most people think of as lowly like serving others and being mistreated for the sake of Jesus.</p></li><li><p>losing their wealth and high status when they were persecuted for being believers in Jesus.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, translate this in a general way that could include both (a) and (b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in being brought low (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when God makes them humble (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God has humbled them (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because he will pass away like a flower of the field.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because he will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">soon</span> die like a wild flower <span data-bnType=\"implied\">does</span>.</p></li><li><p>because they, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and their riches with them,</span> will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">soon</span> end/finish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just</span> like blossoms <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do/finish</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> introduces the basis for the command in 1:10a. The rich believer should take pride in his low position, not in his riches (1:10a), <u>because</u> he, and his riches with him, will not last long (1:10b). In some languages, it is more natural to put the basis for the command (in 1:10b) before the command (in 1:10a). See the General Comment on 1:10a–b below for an example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will pass away like a flower of the field:</strong> This clause is a simile. In this simile, the rich person is compared to a wild flower. Some ways that they are similar are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They are not permanent. Both will soon die.</p></li><li><p>It is only for a short period of time that people regard a rich person and a wild flower as important.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is implied that the rich person’s wealth is also not permanent. You may want to make this explicit in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he, and his riches too, will pass away like a wild flower</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>he will pass away:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>he will pass away</em> here means that the rich believer, like all people, “will die.” His life on this earth will end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The rich will die (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many languages use idiomatic expressions for dying. In English, one such expression is what the BSB has used: <em>pass away.</em> If you have an idiom or an expression that would fit both a flower that withers and dies as well as a person who dies, you may want to use that here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will no longer be alive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will cease to live/be</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will no longer be present</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>like a flower of the field:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>flower of the field</em> refers to flowers that grow on their own. No one plants them. In Israel, the land where James lived, brightly colored wild flowers grow in great numbers when rain comes. But it is not long before the hot sun dries them up, and they die.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages there is no general word for a <em>flower.</em> In such cases, it may be necessary to:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:10a–b</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a word for a specific well-known flower that only lives for a short while and dies in the heat.</p></li><li><p>Use a word for a specific part of a plant such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a blossom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a bloom</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it will be more natural to change the order of the clauses in 1:10 and put the basis (1:10b) before the command (1:10a). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10a</sup>But the one who is rich <sup>10b</sup>will pass away like a flower of the field. <sup>10a</sup>So, he should exult in his low position, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not in his riches</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

There it referred to the rich brother/believer. James was probably still thinking of the rich brother/believer, but what he says is true of all rich people. You can translate this either as “rich brother/believer” or as “rich man/person.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase does not refer to one specific rich man. It refers to all rich people. To make this clear, it may be best to translate this with a plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rich people (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will fade away:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>will fade away</em> refers to a plant withering and dying.

After that, people do not pay attention to them any longer.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is not natural in your language to talk about a person “fading,” you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will die (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will end up being nothing</p></blockquote><h4>1:11f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the midst of his pursuits.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>while he is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">busy</span> working.</p></li><li><p>as they are earning money.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the midst of his pursuits:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the midst of his pursuits</em> here means, “while he is doing his normal activities.” James was probably thinking of the rich man’s daily business activities such as trading.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while they are still taking care of business (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while he is busy working</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>while he is earning money</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:11e–f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it will be more natural to change the order of some of the clauses in this verse.

In 1:12 James recalled 1:2–3 and that it was important to persevere in times of trial and temptation.

Paragraph 1:16–18 reinforces this by saying that God gives only good gifts.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christians should endure testing and temptations</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Trials and temptations</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060001012\" data-endVerseId=\"1060001012\"><h3>Paragraph 1:12</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, James reminded his readers that it is important to persevere when difficult situations test their faith.</p></div><h4>1:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ How blessed is that person who endures when he is tried/tested.</p></li><li><p>¶ Those who do not abandon <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their faith</span> during trials/troubles are favored/fortunate,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Blessed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Blessed</em> means “in a good position” or “in an enviable/desirable situation.” In the Bible, the good situation results when God favors a person and does good to him. The person who perseveres when he is tried and tempted is in a good position.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word does not primarily refer to a feeling. However, a person in this good situation will frequently have good feelings such as happiness and joy. Do not use a word that <u>only</u> refers to material prosperity or physical health.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Joyful/desirable/happy is the situation of the man</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How good it is for the man</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The person is favored/fortunate</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See bless, meaning 1, in the Glossary. Refer also to your translation of Matthew 5:3–11, where this word is used in a similar way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> generally refers to a male. However, in this context, the word introduces a general statement that is true of everyone. In some languages, it may be natural to introduce this statement with a general word like “people” or with a pronoun like “you” or “they.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Blessed are people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Blessed are those</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Blessed is anyone (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will bless you (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>perseveres:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>perseveres</em> means “continued effort to fulfill some purpose.” Someone who perseveres has the ability to face all kinds of troubles, difficulties, and sufferings with courage and faithfulness. He continues to work towards his goal. He does not run away or give up.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>endures (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>persists</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>don’t give up (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This verb corresponds to the noun in 1:3c that the BSB translates as “perseverance”. See the note there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>under trial:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>trial</em> refers to difficult situations that occur in a person’s life and test his faith. These can include both external problems like persecution and internal temptations from Satan.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>during troubles/difficulties</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>hardships/problems</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when they are tested (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when your faith is being tested (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This same word occurs in 1:2b.</p><h4>1:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because when he has stood the test,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For when he has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">successfully</span> completed/passed the test,</p></li><li><p>because when they have proved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that their faith is</span> real/genuine,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The conjunction <em>because</em> introduces the reason that the person who endures trials in 1:12a is blessed. He is blessed (1:12a) <u>because</u> he will receive the crown of life (1:12c). In some languages, it will be more natural to put the reason before 1:12a. See the General Comment on 1:12a–d at the end of 1:12d for an example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when he has stood the test:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>when he has stood the test</em> means “when he has passed the test.” When this person is persecuted because he believes in Jesus, he perseveres. He does not abandon his faith. In this way he passes the test. He shows that his faith is genuine.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When they pass the test (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he has proven to be genuine (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>After they have proved their faith (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “test” here in 1:12b and the word “testing” in 1:3b come from related Greek words.</p><h4>1:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he will receive the crown of life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he will receive a reward that is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life</p></li><li><p>God will give them their reward/prize. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The reward</span> is that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will cause them to live <span data-bnType=\"implied\">forever</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will receive the crown of life:</strong> The word <em>crown</em> literally refers to a wreath of leaves that both the Greek and Roman cultures put on a person’s head in order to honor him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>crown</em> is a metaphor. James was using this metaphor to refer to a “reward” or “prize” for passing a test. He was not saying that believers will receive an actual object on their heads such as a crown.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">So the phrase <em>the crown of life</em> refers to the reward or prize. A person will receive this reward or prize if he perseveres in his faith when he is persecuted. That reward/prize is eternal life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to translate this metaphor:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will receive the crown of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the metaphor without keeping the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he will receive in reward the life which God has promised (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will reward them with life forever (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will give him a reward/prize. That reward is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> life</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>life:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>life</em> here refers to eternal life with God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>life forever (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> that never ends</p></blockquote><h4>1:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that God has promised to those who love Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that God promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give</span> to all those who love him.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He will do this</span> just as he said that he would do to all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> who love him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God:</strong> Most of the earliest Greek manuscripts simply have the pronoun “he” here. Other Greek manuscripts have “God” or “Lord.” The meaning is the same. “He” refers to God. Most English versions supply the word “God” to make it clear who is meant. You may want to do this also.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has promised:</strong> The verb <em>promised</em> means “affirm that he would do something.” God said with certainty that he would give the crown of life to those who passed the test.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>vowed/guaranteed that he would do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>said that he would certainly do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to those who love Him:</strong> The phrase <em>those who love Him</em> refers to all believers. James was including himself and his readers among <em>those who love Him.</em> In some languages, it may be necessary to make this clear by using the word “us.” Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to all those/people who love him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to all of us<sup>(incl)</sup> who love him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to everyone who loves him</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:12a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is more natural to put the reason (1:12b–d) before the result (1:12a). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12b</sup>When someone has stood the test, <sup>12c</sup>he will receive the crown of life <sup>12d</sup>that God has promised to those who love him. <sup>12a</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is why</span> the man who perseveres under trial is blessed.</p></blockquote></div>",

They recognize that 1:2–3 and 1:12 form an <em>inclusio,</em> or verbal bracket to 1:2–12 through the repetition in both of three key words: trials (<em>πειρασμοῖς/πειρασμόν</em>), testing <em>(δοκίμιον/δόκιμος</em>), and endurance (<em>ὑπομονήν/ὑπομένει</em>).</span></span> and two main paragraphs (1:13–15 and 1:16–18).

There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb.

It has a wide range of meanings in Greek. It can mean:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“tested” to cause a person to trust God more.</p></li><li><p>“tempted” to do evil. This is its meaning in 1:13.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The context indicates which meaning is intended.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is necessary to use a different word here than in 1:2b and 1:12a. This is true in English. In other languages, there may be one term which fits both testing/trials and temptations. This is true in Greek. In such a case, it may be necessary to add a phrase that indicates the purpose of the testing/trial. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When we are tested <u>to make us do evil</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When we experience trials/difficulties <u>which might cause us to sin</u></p></blockquote><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>no one should say,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he should not say,</p></li><li><p>that person should not say that</p></li><li><p>do<sup>(plur)</sup> not say that</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“God is tempting me.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“It is God who is tempting me.”</p></li><li><p>God is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one</span> tempting/enticing him to do wrong/evil.</p></li><li><p>God is causing you<sup>(plur)</sup> to want/desire to do evil.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“God is tempting me.”:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>God is tempting me</em> is literally “I am being tempted from God.” The verb is passive. Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:13c</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use a passive verb.

No one should say, “God is tempting me” (1:13a–b), <u>because</u> God cannot be tempted by evil… (1:13d–1:15). The basis for the command continues to the end of 1:15.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God cannot be tempted by evil:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>cannot be tempted by evil</em> means that God never feels the desire to do anything wrong. He never wants to sin. So though someone might try to tempt him, he will never do what is wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb.

It refers to acts and thoughts that are morally harmful and damage a person’s spiritual life. God will never desire to do anything that is wrong, sinful, or against his holy character and nature.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wrong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sinful</p></blockquote><h4>1:13e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nor does He tempt anyone.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>nor does God tempt anyone.</p></li><li><p>and God does not tempt/entice anyone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do wrong</span>.</p></li><li><p>and he never causes anyone to want/desire to do evil.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nor does He tempt anyone:</strong> The clause <em>nor does He tempt anyone</em> means that God does not encourage anyone to do something wrong.

The contrast is between the false idea that God tempts people to sin (1:13) and the true idea about temptation (1:14).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to indicate this contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Rather</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead</p></blockquote><h4>1:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when by his own evil desires</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when his own evil desires</p></li><li><p>when a person himself desires to sin.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of</span> their own evil desires.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his own evil desires:</strong> The Greek noun that the BSB translates as <em>evil desires</em> generally refers to any wish or desire. However, in this context, it is clearly a sinful desire. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wrong desire (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to translate this noun as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he himself desires/wants to do evil</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the word <em>desires</em> here is personified. In other words, <em>desires</em> are said to <u>do</u> things just like a person does. In some languages, it is not natural to say that “evil desires something.” In other words, in these languages, we cannot say that our own “desires” urge or entice us to do something. If your language is like that, you may want to avoid the personification. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When he himself desires to do evil</p></blockquote><h4>1:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he is lured away and enticed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>attract/lure him and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">try to</span> persuade him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to sin</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is like</span> when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">an animal</span> is attracted and lured to a trap.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is as if</span> someone/something is pulling/dragging them to do evil.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>lured away and enticed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>lured away</em> literally means “pulled/lured out.” The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>enticed</em> literally means “attracted with a bait.” In this context, it means “attracted.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These two Greek words are related metaphors. In this metaphor, the way that a person’s evil desires tempt him to sin is compared to the way a hunter catches a wild animal. One way that they are similar is that both the person and the wild animal are attracted to do something that is not good for them to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least three ways to translate these metaphors:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphors. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he is lured and enticed (ESV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like when they <span data-bnType=\"implied\">use bait to</span> attract an animal and lure it to a trap</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>attract him and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">try to</span> persuade him to sin</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">These two Greek words are also a doublet. This means that the two words mean basically the same thing. The reason for saying the same thing in two different ways is to intensify the meaning. If it is not natural to use doublets in your language, you may use one expression and intensify it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which can be enormously attractive (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he is increasingly attracted <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do evil</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he is enticed more and more <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to sin</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:14a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These verse parts contain three passive verbs (tempted, dragged, enticed). There are at least two ways to translate them:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires. (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use active verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A person’s own evil desires tempt him and entice him and drag him away.</p></blockquote></li></ul></div>",

The stages of sin are compared to the stages of a woman having a child. Each stage is described below.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 1:15 is also a personification. This means that “desire” and “sin” are both described as doing things that people normally do.</p><h4>1:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then after desire has conceived,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is like</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> desire becomes pregnant.</p></li><li><p>Next, after he conceives a plan to sin,</p></li><li><p>As a result, they decide to do the evil that they desire,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> The word <em>Then</em> introduces the result and next logical step after a person is enticed to do wrong. When translating this word, consider how your language speaks of events that normally happen in a set order. Consider how to properly introduce an event that is the result of the one before it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As a result</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Next</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And then</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>desire has conceived:</strong> The clause <em>desire has conceived</em> is both a metaphor and personification. After a person is lured to sin (1:14c), the next step is that he actually decides to sin. This step is compared to conceiving a child.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this figure of speech are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor.

The word <em>it</em> refers to “desire” in 1:15a. In this metaphor, sin is committed.

Sins include acts, thoughts, and attitudes that are not what God wants or approves.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In Greek, the verb that English versions translate as <em>sin</em> is also a term that was used in archery to mean “miss the target.” When a person sins, he “misses” the target, that is, he fails to reach God’s standard.</span></span> A person can also offend God by not doing what God wants him to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is helpful to translate “sin” with a general term that can include any wrong act that a person does against God. Here are problems to avoid:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The term should not imply that only serious crimes such as murder or stealing are sins.

When a person continues to sin, it develops or grows into a habit. This is compared to a child becoming mature or fully grown.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this figure of speech are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When sin grows up (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile.

James was probably quoting a piece of poetry or a proverb that repeated the phrase for emphasis.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use two different words.

In other words, this word refers to the things in the sky that give light.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many languages do not have a general word that includes the sun, moon, and stars. If that is the case in your language, you could:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Mention all three words separately. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the sun, moon, and stars</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the things which are in the sky and shine/give light</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>1:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with whom there is no change or shifting shadow.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He does not vary or change like shadows.</p></li><li><p>They move and make shadows that change, but God does not change at all.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with whom there is no change or shifting shadow:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>change or shifting shadow</em> is a metaphor. James was contrasting the lights in the sky with God. The sun, moon, and stars change their position in the sky and cause shadows that also move. In contrast to this, God never changes. Use a word for <em>shadow</em> that does not only refer to the shadow of people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Greek word, <em>ἀποσκίασμα,</em> that is translated as “shadow” is a rare word and not the typical word for shadow. There are quite a variety of suggestions put forward by commentators for its meaning including: shadows cast by heavenly bodies, the “shadow” of night, the phases of the moon, and shadows caused by an eclipse. Elsewhere in Greek literature the word can describe the changing shadows of the moon and the moving shadow of a sundial (see McCartney, page 112).</span></span> Also, be careful not to use a word for shadow that refers to the spirit of a person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor and make the meaning clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who does not vary <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like the sun, moon, and stars</span> or change like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their</span> shadows <span data-bnType=\"implied\">change</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Father doesn’t change like the shifting shadows produced by the sun and the moon. (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s nature/ways never change.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>no change or shifting shadow:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>change</em> and <em>shifting</em> are similar in meaning. Both words were commonly used to describe the changing appearance and movement of the sun, moon, and stars.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual variant here. In place of “with whom there is not change <u>or</u> <u>shadow of turning</u>” some Greek manuscripts read “with whom there is not change <u>which</u> is <u>of a turning/changing shadow</u>.” The variant reading is followed by the REB. Some other versions (GW, NCV, NIV, NJB) may also be following this reading. However, they may just be combining the two references to change in one expression. The general meaning of 1:17c is similar whichever reading is followed.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">If possible, use a word that you would naturally use to describe the “changes” of the sun, moon, and stars. To make it clear that James is contrasting God to the sun, moon, and stars, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unlike the sun, moon, and stars,</span> does not change or move like shadows.</p></blockquote>",

Others see 1:12 as a kind of “hinge” that connects 1:2–11 to 1:12–18 (Moo (2000), pages 71–72; McCartney, page 100). They recognize that 1:2–3 and 1:12 form an <em>inclusio,</em> or verbal bracket to 1:2–12 through the repetition in both of three key words: trials (<em>πειρασμοῖς/πειρασμόν</em>), testing <em>(δοκίμιον/δόκιμος</em>), and endurance (<em>ὑπομονήν/ὑπομένει</em>).</span></span> and two main paragraphs (1:13–15 and 1:16–18). In 1:12 James recalled 1:2–3 and that it was important to persevere in times of trial and temptation. The next paragraph, 1:13–15, points out that it is not God who tempts us but our own sinful desires, which eventually lead to death. Paragraph 1:16–18 reinforces this by saying that God gives only good gifts.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christians should endure testing and temptations</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Trials and temptations</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060001016\" data-endVerseId=\"1060001018\"><h3>Paragraph 1:16–18</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph gives more reasons that show why it is not God who tries to make people do evil. Everything good comes from God, and he never changes. So it is unthinkable that any bad thing could come from him. God wants to give us new life.</p></div><h4>1:18</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:18, James wrote about the particular gift that was foremost in his mind when he said, “Every good gift…comes from above” (1:17). This good gift is that God “chose to give us birth through the word of truth.”</p><h4>1:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He chose to give us birth through the word of truth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He chose to give us<sup>(incl)</sup> new life by means of the true message,</p></li><li><p>He decided to give us<sup>(incl)</sup> eternal life when we believed in the gospel.</p></li><li><p>He chose/decided to send his true message and make us<sup>(incl)</sup> his children.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He chose to give us birth:</strong> This phrase indicates that God planned and decided to give us birth. He did not choose and desire to cause people to sin (see 1:13).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>give us birth:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the phrase <em>give…birth:</em></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>new birth that happens when people become followers of Christ</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Huther, page 74; Alford, page 283; Mayor, page 59; Ropes, page 166; Mitton, pages 56–57; Hiebert, pages 116–117; Adamson (1976), pages 76–77; Davids (1982), pages 89–90; Moo (1985), pages 76–77; Martin, pages 39–41.</span></span> For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give us new birth <em>(NLT96, CEV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>creation of mankind</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In particular, see F. J. A. Hort.</span></span> For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he brought us into being <em>(GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Childbirth is used in the NT as a metaphor for new birth in Christ (1 Peter 1:23; 1 John 3:9), but never for creation. Also the phrase “word of truth” normally refers to the gospel (see the following note on “through the word of truth”). For these reasons, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the metaphor of childbirth (“he gave birth to us”) may be misunderstood. If this is the case in your language, it may be better to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he gave us new life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>us:</strong> James was probably referring to all Christians. See the note on “firstfruits” at the end of this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the word of truth:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>through the word of truth</em> here means “through the true message.” In the NT this phrase commonly refers to the gospel concerning Jesus Christ. Belief in the gospel is the way that God chose to give us new birth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by means of the word of truth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when we believed the true message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because we believed that his word is true</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the General Comment on 1:18a below for other ways to translate this phrase.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>word:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>word</em> means “a message.” It is what someone has said.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:18a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is more natural to put “through the word of truth” before “He chose to give us birth.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word of truth is the way that he chose to give us birth.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He used/took the word of truth and chose to give us new birth.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We believe the word of truth saying, “He chose to give us birth.”</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that we would be a kind of firstfruits of His creation.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that we<sup>(incl)</sup> might be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the most important part</span> of everything he created <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just like</span> the first part/grains <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the harvest</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are the most important part</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this</span> in order that we<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> might be the most important part of everything he created.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>that</em> introduces God’s purpose in giving people new birth. God gave us new birth (1:18a) <u>so that</u> we might be a kind of firstfruits (1:18b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in order that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for the purpose of</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be natural to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this</span> so that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we would be a kind of firstfruits:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a kind of firstfruits</em> is a simile. In this simile, Christians are compared to firstfruits. The word <em>firstfruits</em> refers to the first grains and fruits of the harvest. It also refers to the first-born child and animal. God had asked his people to give their firstfruits to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways that Christians and firstfruits are similar are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Both are first in time, in contrast to others that will come later. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that we might be…the first specimens of his new creation (JBP)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Both are offered to God and so belong to him. As a result, both are more important than other parts of God’s creation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that we should have first place among all his creatures (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to make us his most important creatures (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this simile are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Make explicit the way that Christians and firstfruits are similar. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should be the first to come to him</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just like</span> the firstfruits <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the harvest</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that we <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should be the most important of all his creation</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">just like</span> the firstfruits of the harvest</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that we would be like the first fruit/grains of the harvest <em>If you translate the simile literally, you may want to add a footnote. In the footnote you can explain more fully what firstfruits were and what was being compared in this simile. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The word “firstfruits” refers to the first grains/fruits of the crops that ripen or the firstborn child or animal. God asked the Israelites to give these things to him. Here James compares us Christians to the firstfruits. We are similar in that we are the most important part. We are also the first.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of His creation:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>of His creation</em> is literally “of his creatures” (as in the RSV). This phrase refers to everything that God created. It does not refer just to living things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>of all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the things that</span> he created</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from among everything he made</p></blockquote>",

It refers to both men and women. James loved these believers. This phrase also occurs in 1:16. See the note there for translation advice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">James used this phrase to introduce the subject of controlling one’s speech. He also used this phrase to soften his command (“understand this”) and to make it more polite. You may have another way in your language to introduce a change of subject or to soften a command. If you do, you may be able to use it instead of the phrase <em>My beloved brothers.</em></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>understand this:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>understand this</em> is literally “know” (as in the RSV).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Instead of the verb “know,” some Greek manuscripts have the conjunction that the KJV translates as “wherefore.” The reading “know” is strongly supported by a variety of manuscripts and the majority of English versions.</span></span> James was telling his readers to be attentive to what he was about to write.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>take note of this (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>remember this (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not forget</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is not necessary to translate this word.

Based on the principle that he had just mentioned (1:20), James commanded his hearers to do two things:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>renounce their wickedness, and</p></li><li><p>accept the word of God.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>get rid of all moral filth:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>get rid of</em> here means “remove” or “separate yourself from.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put away all filth (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>remove everything that causes you to be morally dirty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You must stop doing anything immoral (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all moral filth:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>moral filth</em> refers to dirtiness or pollution. Here it is used figuratively to refer to moral uncleanness or wickedness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every evil thing (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everything that is bad</p></blockquote><h4>1:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and every expression of evil,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the extreme amount of evil that you<sup>(plur)</sup> do,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">stop</span> the wicked things that you<sup>(plur)</sup> do so frequently.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>every expression of evil:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>expression of evil</em> is literally “wickedness” (as in the RSV).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Among the meanings of the Greek word, <em>κακια,</em> (translated “evil” here by the BSB) are a) a general meaning, “moral evil/wickedness,” or b) the more specific meaning, “malice.” Both meanings could make good sense in this context. The vast majority of English versions translate the word in the general sense. Commentary opinion is quite evenly split. These Notes follow the English versions. However, other language versions such as French versions favor a meaning closer to “malice.” Some commentaries that support this meaning include Laws, page 81 and Davids (1982), page 94.</span></span> This is a second thing that James wanted his readers to get rid of. It means approximately the same as “moral filth” in 1:21a. For a suggestion on how to combine 1:21a–b, see the General Comment on 1:21a–b following this note.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>every expression</em> means “abundance,” “enormous quantity,” or “extreme amount” (of evil).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the enormous amount of wicked things that you do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the evil things that you do so frequently</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the wicked things you do (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:21a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 1:21a and 1:21b say the same thing with different words. In some languages, it will be more natural to combine the two parts. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So stop doing all kinds of evil things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that remain in your lives</span>.</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and humbly accept the word planted in you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and humble yourselves and accept the word/message that was planted in you.<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should</span> be humble and accept/obey the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God</span> put in your hearts.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Instead,</span> humbly obey/receive the message that God caused you<sup>(plur)</sup> to know.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be natural to start a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Instead, be humble and accept the message (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>humbly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>humbly</em> refers to being submissive and willing to learn. It is the opposite of being proud and angry.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be natural to translate this word as a verb or verb phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be humble (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>humble yourselves</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>accept:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>accept</em> means “welcome” or “receive.” In this context it refers to paying attention to the gospel and obeying it. Some ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>receive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>honor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>obey</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the word planted in you:</strong> The phrase <em>the word planted in you</em> is a metaphor. In this metaphor, preaching the word of God is compared to planting seed in the soil. One way that they are similar is that both activities put/insert something (word – seed) into something else (our hearts – soil). When the word/gospel was preached, it was <em>planted</em> or “put” in our hearts.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the word that he plants in your hearts (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the word that God has placed in you (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the message that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> has caused you to know</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gospel that you heard and know</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the word:</strong> The phrase <em>the word</em> refers to the gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the message (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the good news</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase also occurs in 1:18a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>planted:</strong> The verb <em>planted</em> is passive. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the message that is planted in you (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb.

This message is able to <em>save</em> us in the sense that it tells us about Jesus who can save us.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it would be better to translate this as a clause beginning with “and” rather than <em>which.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Word which has been planted in you <u>and</u> can save your souls (NJB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>save:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>save</em> means “to rescue from danger or trouble.” In this context, it refers to rescuing someone from the spiritual dangers of sin and from death. Spiritual death is the punishment that results from sinning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to make explicit what the person was saved from. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which can save you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the results of sin</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>which can rescue you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from punishment for sin</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See save, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your souls:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>your souls</em> refers to the whole person. That is why many versions translate it simply as <em>you.</em></p>",

They must do/obey it.</p></div><h4>1:22</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:22, there are three clauses in Greek. The BSB follows the Greek order but some other English versions change the Greek order of these clauses. Compare the order of the clauses in the BSB and NIV below.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>22a</sup>Be doers of the word, <sup>22b</sup>and not hearers only, <sup>22c</sup>…deceiving yourselves. (BSB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>22b</sup>Do not merely listen to the word, <sup>22c</sup>and so deceive yourselves. <sup>22a</sup>Do what it says. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You should arrange the clauses in 1:22 in a way that is natural in your language. See the General Comment at the end of 1:22c for more discussion on reordering these clauses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, this verse begins with a conjunction that means “But” in some contexts. Some English versions have translated it as “But” here. However, in this context, it is not indicating a contrast. It simply introduces the next point about the “word.” So, in many languages, no conjunction is necessary here.</p><h4>1:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Be doers of the word,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Be<sup>(plur)</sup> doers of the word.</p></li><li><p>Do<sup>(plur)</sup> what the word says/commands.</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> must also follow/obey it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Be doers of the word:</strong> The clause <em>Be doers of the word</em> refers to those who always do what God’s word tells them to do. Such people put the word’s teaching into practice and regularly obey its commands.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this clause in such a way that the action is habitual, repeated action.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do what it says (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>put it into practice (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>obey God’s message (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the word:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the word</em> refers to the gospel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s word (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s message</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same word occurs in 1:18a and 1:21c.</p><h4>1:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and not hearers only.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Do not only be<sup>(plur)</sup> hearers of the word,</p></li><li><p>¶ Do not only hear<sup>(plur)</sup> the word <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God</span></p></li><li><p>¶ Do not just listen<sup>(plur)</sup> to the good news</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and not hearers only:</strong> The clause <em>and not hearers only</em> indicates that it is not enough to just listen to someone preaching or reading from the word of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not only be hearers of the word</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>don’t just listen to God’s word (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You must do more than just hear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> word/message</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not limit yourselves to just hearing the gospel</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful not to translate this in a way that implies that it is not good to <em>listen to the word.</em></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>not hearers only:</strong> The phrase <em>hearers only</em> refers to those who only hear the gospel teaching. They never do what it tells them to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages, the usual word for “hear” includes the idea of obeying. If this is so in your language, be careful here to use an expression that describes hearing <u>without</u> obeying.</p><h4>1:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Otherwise, you are deceiving yourselves.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and deceive yourselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and think that just hearing is sufficient</span>.</p></li><li><p>or you will fool yourselves. (GW)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Otherwise, you are deceiving yourselves:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>deceiving yourselves</em> can also be translated as “fool yourselves.” It refers to wrong thinking that leads a person astray. Anyone who just listens to the message of the gospel but does not obey its commands is mistaken if he thinks that God is pleased.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>or you will fool yourselves (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and lie to yourselves</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:22a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek and the BSB, a clause with a positive command (“Be doers of the word”) comes first. This is followed by a clause with a negative command (“do not only be hearers”). The NIV reverses the order of the positive and negative commands. Use the order that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Another possible way to translate the verse is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He who hears the word and does not do what it says is deceiving himself. Therefore you should be people who both hear and do, not people who only hear.</p></blockquote></div>",

In this simile, a man who listens to the word (in 1:23a–b) is compared to a man who looks at his face in a mirror (in 1:23c–24b).

He has an attitude of carelessness. He does not consider it important for him to do anything about what he has observed. See the note about the simile in 1:23a–24b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Barclay-Newman and Louw &amp; Nida both suggest “neglect” as a possible meaning of <em>ἐπιλανθάνομαι</em>. The SSA (page 54) on James says, “One sense of the verb <em>ἐπιλανθάνομαι</em> ‘forget’ is ‘neglect to do,’ which is more than just a lapse of memory. It is deliberately not responding to what has been seen.” Martin (page 50), agrees: “What is seen in a mirror is meant to lead to action, usually regarded as remedial. The face is seen to be dirty … or blemished and needing attention. Instead the thoughtless person ‘goes off and forgets’ [in the sense of “neglects to do”] … what he has seen.” Similarly, the New Bible Commentary for this passage (page 1226) says, “The word is compared to a mirror, for it shows a man to himself as he is and the sight is not pleasing... But the mere <em>hearer </em>gives himself a glance and hurries off; and away from the mirror he <em>at once forgets </em>what he saw—though his face was dirty. He does not receive the Word and act on it.” While many commentaries understand “forget” in this passage in the sense of “to not have the remembrance of something,” the two senses are not necessarily unconnected. Thompson in the <em>Wesleyan Bible Commentary </em>(page 212) notes: “If we do not move fairly quickly in doing what we see, the danger of forgetfulness is soon upon us.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>forgets what he saw</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>does nothing to fix the problem he saw and soon forgets about it</p></blockquote>",

They must do/obey it.</p></div><h4>1:25</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek and the BSB, 1:25 is one long sentence. This sentence has many clauses, and some clauses repeat information. In some languages, it will not be natural to follow the BSB order and structure. For some ways to reorder this verse, see the General Comment on 1:25a–e at the end of 1:25e.</p><h4>1:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But the person who carefully studies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> perfect law that sets <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> free</p></li><li><p>But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as regards</span> the person who listens carefully to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> commandments that are perfect and that free <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span>,</p></li><li><p>But some people carefully examine/read the law. This law is completely good and it liberates us<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> indicates a contrast. The contrast is between the person who only hears the word (1:23–24) and the person who hears the word and does it (1:25).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the one who:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>the one who</em> is in a general statement that applies to anyone. In some languages, it may be more natural to use a pronoun or a plural in such a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the person who (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the one who (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>looks intently:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>looks intently</em> literally means “look/peer into.” Here it is used figuratively and means “investigate carefully.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some authorities (including F. Field, page 236, and F. J. A. Hort) think the component of carefulness is not present in the meaning of the verb. It seems, however, that examples can be quoted on both sides. In other words, the context shows whether carefulness is implied or not.</span></span> It refers to determining what God’s word says by listening to someone else read it, asking questions, or reading it oneself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>thoroughly examines</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>carefully study (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>carefully thinks about</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>listens very well</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the perfect law:</strong> The phrase <em>the perfect law</em> refers to all the commandments in God’s word. It refers to the set of instructions and commands that God gave his people to live by. They are perfect. It does not just refer to the Ten Commandments or other laws in the Old Testament. It also includes Jesus’ teachings.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s perfect law (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s perfect teachings (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s perfect rules</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>perfect:</strong> The word <em>perfect</em> means that God’s law is completely good. It has no unrighteous commands.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This same word occurs in 1:17a with similar meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of freedom:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>of freedom</em> describes what the perfect law does for people who obey it. It frees them from sin.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation is explicitly supported by the NIV, GNT, REB, and Huther, page 89. However, since the Greek literally just says, “the law of liberty,” some commentators interpret the phrase as “the law that a person obeys freely.” See Mayor, page 70; Mitton, pages 72–73. But the interpretation that the law sets a person free fits well with the teaching of the Psalms (see Psalm 119:32, “I will run in the path of your commands, for you have set my heart free,” and 119:45 “I will walk about in freedom, for I have sought out your precepts”) and other Jewish literature (for example, “you find no free man except him who occupies himself with the study of Torah,” Aboth 6:2b, cited in Martin, page 51).</span></span> In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>freedom</em> as a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that makes us free (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that sets you free (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages, it may be necessary to provide an object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that frees people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that frees people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do what God wants them to do</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and continues to do so—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and continues to study it</p></li><li><p>if/when he hears and thinks about them constantly,</p></li><li><p>Those who continue to examine/read this law</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and continues to do so:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>continues to do so</em> indicates that the person continues to carefully investigate the law of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be possible to translate this word as part of 1:25a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But the man who <u>continues to</u> look intently into the perfect law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But if you <u>keep</u> looking steadily into God’s perfect law (NLT96)</p></blockquote><h4>1:25c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not being a forgetful hearer, but an effective doer:</strong> In Greek, this is literally “being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>being no hearer that forgets but a doer that acts (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The words “hearer” and “doer” are the same words as in 1:22a and 1:22c. See the notes on 1:22a, 1:22c, and try to use the same expressions here that you did there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and do not simply listen and then forget it, but put it into practice (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They do not forget what they heard, but they obey what God’s teaching says (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not neglecting to do what they heard <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that they should do</span> but doing it</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is more natural in your language to first say what a person does and then say what he does not do, then you may want to reverse the order of these clauses. For example the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard</p></blockquote><h4>1:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not being a forgetful hearer,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and does not just hear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span> and forget,</p></li><li><p>and does not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">neglect and</span> forget what he heard,</p></li><li><p>and do not neglect to do what they have learned,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not being a forgetful hearer:</strong> If you used a verb in 1:25a that means “look,” “read” or “study,” then it may not be natural to use the verb “heard” here. In such a case, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not forgetting what he read/studied</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not forgetting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what he saw in</span> the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not neglecting to do what he has learned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not forgetting what it says</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this is to translate it without the negative. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Remembering what he has heard</p></blockquote><h4>1:25d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:25d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but an effective doer—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but does/obeys <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">teaches</span>,</p></li><li><p>but follows/keeps them,</p></li><li><p>but instead they obey it,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but an effective doer:</strong> The clause <em>effective doer</em> refers to doing what the perfect law teaches. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but doing what the law says/teaches</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but keeping/obeying the law</p></blockquote><h4>1:25e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:25e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he will be blessed in what he does.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he will be blessed for doing/keeping it.</p></li><li><p>God will bless him because he follows/keeps the commandments.</p></li><li><p>they will be favored/fortunate.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will be blessed in what he does:</strong> The clause that the BSB translates as <em>he will be blessed in what he does</em> is literally “that one will be blessed in the doing of him/it.” The Greek pronoun can be translated as either “him” or “it.” As a result, there are two different ways to interpret the words “the doing of him/it”:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The pronoun should be interpreted as “it” and refers to <u>the law</u>. So the words “the doing of it” refer to doing/keeping the law. According to this interpretation, God will bless a person because he keeps the law. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says…, then God will bless you <u>for doing it</u>. <em>(RSV, ESV, REB, JBP, NLT, NCV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NIV, NASB, KJV, and NET (which all say something similar to “will be blessed in what he does”) are somewhat ambiguous but the intended meaning may be “in what he does to keep/do the law.”</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The pronoun should be interpreted as “him” and refers to <u>the man</u> in 1:25a. So the words “the doing of him” refer to the activities that the man does. According to this interpretation, God will bless the man in everything he does. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But anyone who looks steadily at the perfect law of freedom and keeps to it…will be blessed <u>in every undertaking</u>. <em>(NJB, GNT<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The GNT’s “you will be blessed by God in what you do” will probably be interpreted by most readers to mean “in whatever you do.” It is also possible to understand “in what you do” to refer to what was just said about putting the law into practice.</span></span>, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) because this is the most natural meaning of the phrase “the doing of it” in this context. These words refer to the same action as the words “doing it” in 1:25d. In other words, it means doing what the law says.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will be blessed because he does/keeps the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will be blessed through/by doing it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Those who do this will be made happy (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be natural to translate the clause <em>in what he does</em> because it repeats information in 1:25d. If that is true in your language, you may leave this clause implicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he will be blessed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will be blessed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>blessed</em> means that the person is in a good position or situation. In other words, because he is doing what the law commands, all will be well with him. He will be <em>blessed</em> in the sense that God will think well of him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God will bless him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>how good it will be for that kind of person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a person like that will be favored/fortunate</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This does not mean that he will necessarily be comfortable or successful from a human point of view.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This same word occurs in 1:12. See bless, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:25a–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek and the BSB, 1:25 is one, long sentence. In some languages, it may be natural to divide this long sentence into several sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>25a</sup>But the truly happy people are those who carefully study God’s perfect law that makes people free, <sup>25b</sup>and they continue to study it. <sup>25c</sup>They do not forget what they heard, <sup>25d</sup>but they obey what God’s teaching says. <sup>25e</sup>Those who do this will be made happy. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">It may also be natural to change the order of some of the clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>25a–b</sup>But if you keep looking steadily into God’s perfect law—the law that sets you free—<sup>25d</sup>and if you do what it says <sup>25c</sup>and don’t forget what you heard, <sup>25e</sup>then God will bless you for doing it. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The law is complete and frees us<sup>(incl)</sup> from sin. So if we study it carefully, and remember to always obey it, God will bless us.</p></blockquote></div>",

The RSV follows this grammatical structure: <u>Condition</u> <sup>26a</sup>If any one thinks he is religious<sup>26b</sup>and does not bridle his tongue<sup>26c</sup>but deceives himself,<u>Consequence</u><sup>26d</sup>this man’s religion is vain.The NIV and many other modern versions have transferred 1:26c (but deceives himself) to the consequence. One way to emphasize the consequence in 1:26d is to make it a separate sentence. For example, the GW says:<sup>26a</sup>If a person thinks that he is religious<sup>26b</sup>but can’t control his tongue,<sup>26c</sup>he is fooling himself.<sup>26d</sup>That person’s religion is worthless.</span></span> The clause <em>his religion is worthless</em> indicates that all that he does to show that he is devoted to God is useless in God’s eyes. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>this person’s religious acts/practices are worth nothing</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his religion is of no worth/use</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>his worship has no value</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>religion:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>religion</em> refers to the worship of God or gods.

If your language is like that, you should try and intensify that word to convey James’ emphasis here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely pure</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Pure:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Pure</em> means “clean.” Here it is used in a figurative sense to mean “having no sin.” It has a very positive sense.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>undefiled:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>undefiled</em> means “unpolluted” or “faultless.” It conveys a positive sense by saying “not anything is bad” about it.</p><p data-indent=\"3\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>without fault (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>genuine (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>spotless (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>without sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>What God the Father considers to be pure and genuine religion is this: (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>Religion that pleases God the Father must be pure and spotless. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our God and Father:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>our God and Father</em> is literally “the God and father.” The BSB has supplied the word <em>our.</em> Another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God the Father (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to care for orphans and widows in their distress,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to take care of orphans and widows who are suffering,</p></li><li><p>helping children who have no father and widows when they have problems/difficulties,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to care for orphans and widows:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>to look after</em> literally means “to visit” (as in the RSV). In this context, it means “to take care of,” “to care for,” or “to help” orphans and widows. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to take care of orphans and widows (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we must care for orphans and widows (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must help…orphans and widows (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an expression that is natural in your language for caring for widows and orphans.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>orphans:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>orphans</em> refers to children whose father had died. It also refers to children whose father and mother have died. If the word &quot;orphan&quot; in your language refers only to those who have lost both a mother and a father, then you may want to translate this word as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the fatherless</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in their distress:</strong> The phrase <em>in their distress</em> refers to both orphans and widows. It does not just refer to widows.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>distress</em> also means “affliction,” “suffering,” or “troubles.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Jewish society, orphans and widows were the people who needed help most frequently. James did not mean that all orphans and widows always suffer. So it may be natural to translate this phrase as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when they suffer (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who are suffering</p></blockquote><h4>1:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the world.</p></li><li><p>and not let this world make you evil.

This word also means “spotless” or “without blemish.” Here it is used in a spiritual sense. Just as we try to keep dirt from staining our clothing, so we should keep the world from having a negative effect on our lives.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and to keep oneself from being corrupted by the world (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and keeping oneself uncontaminated by the world (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and refusing to let the world corrupt you.

But many versions add the word <em>ring</em> to make the sense clear. This word indicates that the man was rich.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek does not specify whether the man was wearing one ring or many rings.

So, even though interpretation (1) is the preferred interpretation, your translation may combine interpretations (1) and (2). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sir, here is a good seat for you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Please, sir, sit here in this nice seat</p></blockquote><h4>2:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but say to the poor man, “You must stand”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but you<sup>(plur)</sup> say to the poor man, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Go</span> stand<sup>(sing)</sup> over there,”</p></li><li><p>However, you<sup>(plur)</sup> tell the poor man to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">go</span> stand at the side,</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:3c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“You must stand” or “Sit at my feet,”:</strong> In the earliest Greek manuscripts, there were no punctuation marks. There are two ways to punctuate this sentence:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>There should be two separate quotations. According to this interpretation, these two clauses are two possible <u>commands</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Adamson (1976), page 101; Dibelius, page 132; Lenski, page 565.</span></span> For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“You stand over there,” or “Sit on the floor.” <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NET, GW, NCV, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>There should be only one quotation. According to this interpretation, the poor man was given two <u>choices</u>: sit on the ground or stand.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, page 291; Huther, page 102; Mitton, page 83; Hiebert, page 153; Moo (1985), page 89; Martin, page 62.</span></span> For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>‘You stand over there, or sit here on the floor by my footstool,’ <em>(KJV, REB, NASB, GNT, NLT, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It seems unlikely that people would give the poor man a choice between sitting or standing. It seems more likely that James mentioned two commands that people might give to a poor man. Therefore, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but to the poor man you either say, “Stand over there,” or you say, “Sit on the ground/floor.”</p></blockquote><h4>2:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or “Sit at my feet,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">say,</span> “You<sup>(sing)</sup> sit there on the ground at my feet,”</p></li><li><p>or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">perhaps</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">tell him</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">go</span><sup>(sing)</sup> sit on the ground.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Sit at my feet,”:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>sit at my feet</em> is literally “sit below my footstool.” At the time when James lived, important people used to sit on a fine chair with a low stool in front of it. They would rest their feet on this stool. This was called a footstool. Poor people would sit on the floor below the level of the rich person’s feet on the footstool.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sit here on the floor by my footstool (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sit on the floor next to my chair</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sit down next to my feet</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">What is important here is not the footstool itself but the fact that “below the footstool” represents the most inferior place. Use an expression that shows that the speaker is showing contempt for the poor man. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sit on the ground</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>go sit over there</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:3a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">When translating the words spoken to the two men who might come into the worship place, it is more natural in some languages to use indirect speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You must not give the best seat to the one in fancy clothes and tell the one who is poor to stand at the side or sit on the floor.

They should treat everyone with kindness. This is one of the marks of a truly godly person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Show mercy and honor to poor people and thereby fulfill the royal law of love</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Obey the law of love by treating poor people with mercy and honor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not discriminate against poor people</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060002005\" data-endVerseId=\"1060002007\"><h3>Paragraph 2:5–7</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, James wrote about two further reasons why Christians should not favor a rich person above a poor one. The reasons are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>that God honors poor people, and</p></li><li><p>that the enemies of Christ and the church are more likely to be rich people.</p></li></ol></div><h4>2:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But you have dishonored the poor.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But you,<sup>(plur)</sup> you have dishonored that poor man!</p></li><li><p>But as for you,<sup>(plur)</sup> you have shown no respect to the poor man! <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Why do you do that?</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> here indicates a contrast. The contrast is between what God had done (chosen the poor) in 2:5, and what James’ readers had done (dishonored the poor) in 2:6.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have dishonored:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>dishonored</em> refers to being rude to someone by what you do or say. The believers whom James was addressing should have realized that the poor person was important to God. Instead they treated him as someone who deserved no respect.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have insulted (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have humiliated</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have treated shamefully</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you have shown no respect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is emphatic in Greek. One way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as for you, you</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the poor:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the poor</em> is singular. So James was probably referring again to his example, and <em>the poor</em> is the poor man of 2:2–3. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the poor man (NLT96)</p></blockquote><h4>2:6b–7b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The rhetorical questions in 2:6b–7b all imply that it was foolish to honor the rich, because they were the very ones who were being cruel to Christian believers. You may be able to show this by making some of this information explicit in 2:6. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2:6a</sup>But you have dishonored the poor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and honored the rich. Why?</span>. <sup>2:6b</sup>Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2:6a</sup>But you have insulted the poor. <sup>2:6b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are foolish!</span> Is it not the rich who oppress you?</p></blockquote><h4>2:6b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek and the BSB, 2:6b–c forms one rhetorical question. Some translations, however, translate 2:6b–c as two rhetorical questions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Do whatever is clearest and easiest to understand in your language.</p><h4>2:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Is it not the rich who oppress you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Is it not the rich people who are oppressing you<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li><li><p>It is rich people who are causing you<sup>(plur)</sup> trouble, right?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You certainly know that</span> it is rich people who cause you<sup>(plur)</sup> to suffer!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Is it not the rich who oppress you:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. James used this rhetorical question to emphasize that it was the rich people who were exploiting the believers. He implied that his readers knew this very well.

For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8d</sup>You will be doing the right thing <sup>8a</sup>if you obey the law of the Kingdom,…<sup>9a</sup><u>But</u> if you… <em>(KJV, GNT, CEV, JBP, NCV<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is not certain that these versions are following this interpretation. But since <em>μεν </em>is often left untranslated in a <em>μεν</em> … <em>δε </em>construction, it is possible that these versions are interpreting (and translating) <em>μεντοι </em>… <em>δε </em>in a similar way to <em>μεν</em> … <em>δε.</em></span></span>)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It indicates that <u>something is true, and it indicates it with emphasis</u>. It can be translated as “really,” “truly,” or “in fact.” <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, ESV, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>It indicates a <u>contrast with what comes before</u>. In this context, it contrasts with showing partiality against poor people as described in 2:1–7 and explicitly noted in 2:6a, “you have insulted the poor.” It can be translated as “but” or “however.” For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law… <em>(NASB, REB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In the case of interpretations (2) and (3), some scholars also think that this conjunction indicates some irony.

It is certain that the conjunction shows contrast with 2:9. It may <u>also</u> show contrast with what goes before or emphasize the truth of the statement (or show irony), but this is less certain. And these should be clear from the context with or without a conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In most languages, it will be enough to mark the contrast at the beginning of 2:9.

The royal law is written in the Scripture.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the Scripture</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>written in Scripture</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as God said in the Scripture</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by keeping in particular God’s command which says</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Scripture:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Scripture</em> is used in a special way in the New Testament. It refers to words that God directed someone to write. Such writings had authority because God guided a person to write them. In the New Testament the word <em>Scripture</em> almost always refers to something that was written in the Old Testament. Here it refers to the verse which follows, quoted from Leviticus 19:18.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>Scripture</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s written words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this word of God that someone/Moses wrote</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s written command</p></blockquote><h4>2:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Love your neighbor as yourself,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Love your<sup>(sing)</sup> neighbor as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you love</span> yourself,”</p></li><li><p>that people should love their fellow human beings as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">well as</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they love</span> themselves,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Love your neighbor as yourself:</strong> In Greek, the word <em>Love</em> is singular. The word <em>neighbor</em> is also singular. However, this command was intended for everyone. It was also intended to command us to love all our neighbors, not just one. In many languages, it will be more natural to use plurals here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Love<sup>(sing)</sup> your neighbors as yourself</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Love<sup>(plur)</sup> your neighbors as you<sup>(plur)</sup> love yourselves</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People should love their neighbors as they love themselves</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This command also occurs in Matthew 19:19; Mark 12:31; Luke 10:27; and Romans 13:9. You should translate it here as you did in these other passages.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Love:</strong> In this context, <em>Love</em> refers to seeking the well-being of others. It does not refer to having warm feelings towards them. It also does not refer to romantic love.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do what is best for</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Act lovingly toward</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do good things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that show you care for</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>neighbor:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>neighbor</em> literally refers to someone who lives nearby. It also refers to someone of the same social group or someone who speaks the same language. It can also refer to anyone you interact with.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>person who is near you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fellow human being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people you interact with</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:8a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is more natural to change the order of 2:8a–d.

The contrast is between loving your neighbor and thus keeping the law (in 2:8) and showing favoritism and thus breaking the law (in 2:9).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you show favoritism:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>show favoritism</em> refers to treating some people better than others because of their wealth or position in society.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>you show favoritism</em> implies the person is habitually showing favoritism. This verb is from the same root as the noun that the BSB translates as <em>favoritism</em> in 2:1b. See the notes there for translation advice.</p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> are sinning, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> law convicts/condemns you as people who break the law.</p></li><li><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> are doing evil/wrong.

That is a sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you do what is wrong/evil</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you offend/disobey God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are doing things against God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the note on “sin” at 1:15b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are convicted by the law:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>convicted</em> means “shown or proven to be guilty.” This is a passive verb. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are convicted by the law (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>are shown to be guilty by the law</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Law condemns you (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Scriptures teach that you have sinned (CEV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the law:</strong> The phrase <em>the law</em> refers to the same law that was called “the royal law” in 2:8a. Notice that in this verse the law is personified. This means that James said that the law did something as if it were a person. It “convicts” somebody just as a judge or prosecutor proves that somebody disobeyed a law of the government.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural not to personify the word <em>law.</em> If this is the case in your language, you could say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are guilty of breaking the law (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you deserve punishment for disobeying God’s commands</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as transgressors:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>transgressors</em> means “people who do things contrary to what God commanded in the law.” It refers to people who deliberately disobey the law. In some languages, it may be more natural to translate this noun as a phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who disobey God’s laws</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person who does not do what God told people to do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>those who violate God’s laws</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be possible to translate the phrase “are convicted by the law” and the phrase “as lawbreakers” as one phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are guilty of not obeying the law.</p></blockquote>",

When someone shows favoritism, he is not keeping the part of the law that tells him to love his neighbor as himself. He has broken this one commandment in the law, so he has broken all the law.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, James’ explanation will be clearer if some clauses in 2:10–11 are reordered.

Here these commands are singular just as they are in the Old Testament in Hebrew. God gave these commands to each Israelite.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, people do not use a singular form to give a general command like this. Use whatever form is natural in your language for giving this type of general command. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> must not commit adultery. You<sup>(plur)</sup> must not murder.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People must not commit adultery. People must not murder.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also, in some languages, it may be more natural to use indirect speech here.

That statement is, “If you break one law, you are guilty of breaking all the law.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a conjunction will not be necessary here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who said:</strong> The word <em>He</em> refers to God.

It also refers to a married person having sexual relations with anyone other than their spouse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many languages have hidden ways of saying <em>adultery</em> that are understood but do not embarrass people when it is read in public. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not behave immorally with one not your spouse</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be faithful in marriage (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not have sexual relations with anyone who is not your spouse</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same word occurs in Matthew 5:27; Luke 18:20; and Romans 13:9.</p><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>also said, “Do not murder.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>also said, “You<sup>(sing)</sup> must not murder <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.”</p></li><li><p>He also commanded us<sup>(incl)</sup> not to kill <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>“Do not murder.”:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>murder</em> means “kill someone deliberately.” Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not kill</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not purposefully cause someone to die</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do not intentionally slay someone</p></blockquote><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If you do not commit adultery,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Therefore,</span> if you<sup>(sing)</sup> do not commit adultery,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for example,</span> someone who does not behave immorally,</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but do commit murder,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but you<sup>(sing)</sup> murder <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a person</span>,</p></li><li><p>but who has killed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">someone</span>,</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:11c–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker:</strong> James used an “if” clause to begin a specific example of his principle in 2:10. (The principle is that someone who breaks one point of the law breaks the entire law.) In some languages, it may be more natural to begin a specific example without using an “if” clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11c</sup>Someone who does not commit adultery, <sup>11d</sup>but commits murder, <sup>11e</sup>is still a lawbreaker.</p></blockquote><h4>2:11e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you have become a lawbreaker.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> have broken <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> law.</p></li><li><p>has disobeyed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> commands. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So when you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">show favoritism, you are not keeping the law to love your neighbor as yourself.

His explanation may also be clearer if some information is made explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10b</sup>Anyone who stumbles at just one point <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the law</span> <sup>10c</sup>is guilty of breaking all of it <sup>10a</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">even if</span> he keeps the rest of the law. <sup>11d</sup>For example, if someone commits murder <sup>11c</sup>but never commits adultery, <sup>11e</sup>he is a lawbreaker <sup>11b</sup>because God told us both not to murder and <sup>11a</sup>not to commit adultery. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So that is why, when you show favoritism, you are breaking the law. You are not following God’s command to love your neighbor as yourself.</span></p></blockquote></div>",

A future judgment is certain to happen. The word <em>as</em> does not mean that people should just behave “as if” judgment were going to happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like people who will be judged (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>remember that you will be judged (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because you are going to be judged</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>those who are going to be judged:</strong> This is a passive verb phrase. There are at least two ways to translate it:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who will be judged (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb.

God will evaluate whether each person has kept his law. On that basis, he will decide whether the person is innocent or guilty.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many commentators (see, for example, Lenski, pages 574–575; McCartney, page 150; Mitton, pages 95–96; Moo (2000), pages 116 and 118) in looking at the wider context of Scripture take the position that this judgment does not lead directly to a verdict of guilt or innocence before God based on the law. Rather obedience to the law is evidence that someone has been shown grace. Their actions and particularly their actions of grace and mercy to all people demonstrate that they are truly saved.</span></span> Those who have obeyed his law, in particular the law which says to love your neighbor (2:8), will be judged to be righteous.

It does not refer to just one law. So in some languages, it is more natural to use the plural “laws” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by laws (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that gives freedom:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>that gives freedom</em> describes what the law does for people who obey it. It sets them free from sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the expression <em>the law that gives freedom</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the law that sets us/you free</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the law that makes people free (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the law that frees people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be natural to translate this phrase as a separate sentence.

The BSB has supplied the words <em>will be shown</em> to make the Greek phrase a natural English clause.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the verb “is” in the present or future.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will judge without mercy</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judgment:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>judgment</em> is literally “the judgment.” It refers back to the fact that God will judge people (2:12).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God will judge you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God will decide if you are righteous or guilty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See judge, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>without mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>without mercy</em> refers to God’s choosing to withhold mercy. When God evaluates and decides if a person is righteous or not, he will not show mercy when deciding.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>mercy</em> means to show kindness toward people who are in need. Here it specifically means kindness beyond what a person deserves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there will be no pity (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without kindness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will not use grace (when he judges)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to anyone who has not been merciful:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to anyone who has not been merciful</em> is literally “to the one who has not done mercy.” Here “mercy” refers to kindness shown to those who are suffering or in need, such as the poor believers mentioned in 2:1–6.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">James was referring to an entire group of people. So in many languages, it may be more natural to translate this phrase in the plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>those</u> who have not shown mercy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>merciful:</strong> Here the word <em>merciful</em> refers to the kindness that people show to their fellow human beings who are suffering or in need. Merciful people show this kindness whether or not their fellow human beings have offended them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the sense of mercy is slightly different than the same word in the phrase “judgment without mercy.” There “mercy” refers to kindness that God shows to people who have offended him and deserve judgment/punishment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">What is common to both senses is the idea of being kind to people in need. If possible, you should try to use the same word or expression both times. If your language would normally use different words or expressions for these two senses, try to see if you can translate this in a way to show the connection between the two words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>At the time of judgment, God will not be kind to those who have not been kind to others who are in need.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:12a–13a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to put the reason in 2:13a before the result in 2:12a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. <sup>12a</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> speak and act as those who are going to be judged <sup>12b</sup>by the law that gives freedom.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Mercy triumphs over judgment.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">However,</span> mercy will conquer judgment!</p></li><li><p>Yet compassion knows it is stronger than judgment.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> the person who is merciful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span> does not fear the time when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will</span> judge everyone.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a contrast between 2:13a and 2:13b. The contrast is between judgment without mercy (2:13a) and mercy triumphing over judgment (2:13b). Verse 2:13a is something that no one desires. Verse 2:13b is desirable. In some languages, it may be natural to use a conjunction that shows contrast. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Mercy triumphs over judgment:</strong> This is a type of proverb. It is stated in a few words using abstract nouns. In this proverb, <em>Mercy</em> is personified. This means that <em>Mercy</em> is spoken of as if it were a person. This person triumphs over his opponent. This means that he has victory over him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this sentence are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate this like a proverb and keep the abstract nouns <em>mercy</em> and <em>judgment</em> and the personification. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Mercy triumphs over judgment. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Mercy is confident when it confronts judgment.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Mercy is more powerful than judgment.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it like a proverb but without the personification.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is an interpretation issue that comes into play in any attempt to make the meaning of this proverbial expression more explicit. The question is whether mercy refers to people showing mercy/compassion to others or to God’s mercy shown toward merciful people. The majority view (see, for example, Moo (2000), page 118; Ropes, page 202; Translator’s Handbook, page 81; SSA, page 72; NLT; NCV) is clearly that mercy refers to people showing mercy or compassion to others. This follows the same sense of mercy as it was last used in 2:13a “to anyone who has not been merciful.” It expresses in positive terms what 2:13a has expressed in negative terms, and it lines up well with other verses about mercy such as Matthew 5:7. The weakness of this view is that James’ choice of verb seems unusual to express such a meaning: mercy (shown by man) boasts/triumphs over God’s judgment. The minority view is found in Martin, page 72, and the CEV.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The person who shows mercy can be confident on the day when God judges everyone.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A man who is merciful to others does not need to have fear on the day when God will judge people.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When anyone is merciful to others, God will judge him with mercy.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Mercy:</strong> <em>Mercy</em> here probably refers to the kindness or compassion that a person shows to others who are suffering or in need. It refers to how believers should be treating poor people in their congregation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The same word with the same meaning occurs at the end of 2:13a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>triumphs over:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB here translates as <em>triumphs over</em> probably means that a person is joyfully confident even though something threatens him. “Mercy” (personified) knows that it is superior to judgment and so is not afraid of judgment. In other words, a merciful person is not afraid that God will condemn him. For ways to translate this word, see the examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judgment:</strong> Here <em>judgment</em> refers to God’s act of judging people. It has the same meaning as in 2:12a and 2:13a.</p>",

Some of the difficulties are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is not clear whom the word <em>someone</em> refers to.</p></li><li><p>It is not clear whom the pronouns <em>You</em> and <em>I</em> refer to.</p></li><li><p>It is not clear where the quotation ends.

Ropes gives six options and McCartney lists eight (while leaving out the option put forward by Huther (pages 89–92) and Lenski, (pages 581–582) which is described in footnote 52).</span></span> The two interpretations that most English versions follow are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word <em>someone</em> refers to an <u>imaginary opponent</u> of James. <em>The pronouns You and I in the quotation are a way to say that </em><u><em>some people</em></u><em> have faith; </em><u><em>other people</em></u><em> do good deeds. These pronouns do not refer specifically to James, to James’ audience or to the imaginary opponent.</em> <em>The quotation includes </em><u><em>only</em></u><em> the words “You have faith; I have deeds.”</em> <em>According to this interpretation, the imaginary opponent was speaking to James. He implied that (a) faith alone can save a person and (b) works alone can also save a person.</em> <em>For example, the REB says:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But someone may say: ‘One chooses faith, another action.’ To which I reply: ‘Show me this faith you speak of with no actions to prove it, while I by my actions will prove to you my faith.’ <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, ESV, REB, NET, GW, GNT, NLT, NCV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This interpretation was defended by Ropes, pages 208–214; and is accepted by Davids (1982), pages 123–125; Laws, pages 122–124; Mitton, page 109; Moo (1985), page 105.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word <em>someone</em> refers to a person who <u>agrees</u> with James. <em>The pronoun I refers to the person who agrees with James. The pronoun You refers to an imaginary opponent.</em> <em>The quotation includes </em><u><em>all</em></u><em> of 2:18b–e.</em> <em>According to this interpretation, the person who agrees with James was speaking to an imaginary opponent. This opponent claimed to have faith but did not have good deeds. The words of the person who agrees with James were somewhat ironic. That is, he did not believe the imaginary opponent had true faith: “You have faith, do you?”</em> <em>For example, the NASB says:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.” <em>(NJB, KJV, NASB, JBP)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, pages 298–299; Mayor, pages 95–96; Adamson (1976), pages 124–125.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This interpretation is supported by the majority of English versions and a number of commentators.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Two other interpretations deserve mention though they are not followed by any of the main English versions:(3) “But someone will say, ‘Do you have faith?’ And I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will say</span>, ‘I have deeds. Show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my faith by my deeds’.” According to this interpretation, the words of the imaginary opponent continue only as far as <em>faith,</em> and these words are in the form of a question: “Do <u>you</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> have faith?” Unlike James, the opponent thinks that faith in God is entirely separate from good deeds. So he asks whether James himself really has genuine faith. James replies that he has <u>deeds</u> to his credit and then challenges the opponent to prove that his own faith is real. Interpretation (3) was proposed by H. Neitzel in an article in German (1982) and is supported by Ronald Y. K. Fung (1992) and other writers: H. Neitzel, 1982, “Eine alte crux interpretum im Jakobusbrief 2:18”, <em>Zeitschrift für Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft,</em> pages 286–293. R. Y. K. Fung, “ ‘Justification’ in the Epistle of James”, in <em>Right With God: Justification in the Bible and the World,</em> ed. D. A. Carson, 1992. Pages 148–151 with endnotes pages 279–280 deal with this issue. Neitzel’s interpretation is not the first to take the opponent’s words as a question and <em>I have deeds</em> as the words of James. This was already the approach of F. J. A. Hort (1909). Neitzel’s interpretation is actually a refinement of Hort’s, taking <em>κἀγὼ</em> as standing for the speech introduction “And I will say”, rather than being the start of the content of what James said. In this way, Neitzel overcomes the objection raised against Hort’s interpretation by Moo (1985), page 105.(4) “But someone may say that you have faith and I have works.” This interpretation understands “you have faith and I have works” as indirect rather than direct speech. It takes <em>you </em>(sing.) to refer to the person that James has been opposing and <em>I</em> to refer to James. The objector is speaking to James and his opponent at the same time, saying that some people have faith and others have good deeds, implying that either is acceptable and you should not expect everyone to have both of them. Then James replies directly to his opponent, challenging him to prove the reality of his faith, and offering to prove the reality of his own faith from his deeds.The objections to this interpretation are: (a) Normally in this kind of Greek discourse the objector addresses the author, not the author and his opponent together; and (b) usually in the NT after “to say” direct speech is used (James 1:13, 2:3, 4:13, also Luke 4:23; Romans 11:19, etc.), although in none of these examples is a third person addressing two people. (c) It refers to James’ opponent (the person who says that he has faith in 2:14) in the second person, though in 2:14–17, he is a hypothetical person addressed with indefinite third person forms (<em>τις </em>“someone” in 2:14, <em>τις αὐτοῖς </em>“someone among you” in 2:16). This interpretation was proposed by Huther, pages 89–92, and is accepted by Lenski, pages 581–582, R. B. Terry, D. J. Verseput, and others.</span></span></p><h4>2:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But someone will say,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">maybe</span> someone will say,</p></li><li><p>¶ But <span data-bnType=\"implied\">perhaps</span> someone will argue/debate and say <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> introduces a strong contrast.

The statement in 2:18b–c is a type of debate or argument. One way to introduce this argument more clearly is to use a more specific verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone will argue</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone will debate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span> saying</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Suppose</span> someone disagrees and says</p></blockquote><h4>2:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“You have faith</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Some people have faith; (NLT)</p></li><li><p>“One person believes/trusts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I have deeds.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>others have good deeds.” (NLT)</p></li><li><p>Someone else does <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>2:18b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You have faith and I have deeds:</strong> As mentioned above under interpretation (1), the pronouns <em>You</em> and <em>I</em> are a way to say that <u>some people</u> have faith, <u>other people</u> do good deeds. These pronouns do not refer specifically to James, to James’ audience or to the imaginary opponent.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider how speakers in your culture create imaginary persons as examples when they discuss a topic seriously. You may choose to use those types of references here. Also consider if it may be best to replace the pronouns <em>You</em> and <em>I</em> with more general words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“One person has faith, another has actions.” (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“Some people have faith; others have good deeds.” (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>“One person trusts Jesus, another person does good deeds.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The imaginary opponent was arguing that there are different ways to be saved. He said that some are saved because of their faith. Others are saved because of their good deeds. In some languages, it may be good to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>18a</sup>But someone will argue <sup>18b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that there are different ways in which people are saved.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He may say</span> “One person has faith, <sup>18c</sup>another has good deeds. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Either one of these is enough.</span>”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>18a</sup>But someone will disagree saying <sup>18b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that people do not all follow God in the same way.</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He may say</span> “One person has faith, <sup>18c</sup>another has good deeds.”</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>18b</sup>“Some have faith; <sup>18c</sup>others have works; don’t expect everyone to have both.” (NET note)</p></blockquote><h4>2:18d–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 2:18d–e is James’ reply to the imaginary opponent of 2:18b–c. In some languages, it may be necessary to make it clear that James is now speaking for himself. One way to do this is to begin 2:18d with a short phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My answer is (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I say (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But I, James, say</p></blockquote><h4>2:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Show me your faith without deeds,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Show me that you<sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span> even when you do no <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will answer,</span> “Can you<sup>(sing)</sup> prove to me that you believe/trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus Christ</span> when you do not do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Show me your faith without deeds:</strong> This clause challenges someone to prove that he has true faith when he does not have good deeds to support his claim.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Show me that you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> believe/trust in Jesus, even when you do no good deeds.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I challenge you to</span> prove to me that you have faith when you have no deeds.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be natural to translate this clause as a rhetorical question.

The two types of belief are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The type of belief that people have when they trust in God and entrust themselves to Jesus, the Messiah. This type of belief results in salvation.

It means “accept that a certain statement is true.” It refers specifically to the statement <em>God is one.</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">James used the same Greek word to talk about these two types of belief. If your language uses two different terms for these two meanings of “believe/faith,” it may be helpful to indicate how they are related. See the General Comment on 2:19a–d at the end of 2:19d for some suggestions of how to do this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You accept as true that there is one God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You affirm that there is one God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are convinced that there is one God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also believe, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You:</strong> In this verse, James continued to address the person who disagreed with him. So in Greek, the pronoun <em>You</em> is singular. However, James was also writing to anyone who believed that it was possible to have faith without good deeds. So, in some languages, it will be more natural to use the plural form of “you” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God is one:</strong> The Jewish belief that <em>God is one</em> was the most basic belief of all Jews. (This belief is expressed in Deuteronomy 6:4.) This belief was in contrast to belief in many gods.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual issue here. There are a number of textual variants, but the main point of difference is whether the definite article appears with “God” (<em>εἷς ἐστιν ὁ θεός </em>vs. <em>εἷς θεός ἐστιν</em>). Some commentators (Moo (2000), page 130; Martin, page 77; Hiebert, page 186, for example) feel “God” with the article focuses on the unity of God (“God is one”) while “God” without the article would be a statement of monotheism (“there is one God”). Other commentators (Davids (1982), page 125; Lenski, page 584; Huther, page 92, Translator’s Handbook, page 89) suggest that the meaning of either reading would be the same – probably understood as an affirmation of monotheism.Independent of which textual variant is chosen (or whether one sees all variants as essentially expressing the same meaning), there is some question of whether this is a statement about the unity of God or his uniqueness (a statement of monotheism). The discussion in commentaries is somewhat confusing because some writers seem to use unity to mean uniqueness. That is, they state that this was about the unity of God, but then discuss unity in the sense of monotheism. Most English versions translate this as a statement of monotheism (as the NIV does). For the versions that translate it as “God is one” (RSV, ESV, NASB, NET), it is not certain if they intend this to express the unity of God or his uniqueness (monotheism). In considering the context in which Deuteronomy 6:4 was spoken and the context of the book of James, it seems much more likely that this expresses monotheism (in contrast to belief in many gods) than it does the unity of God (in contrast to his fragmentation or division into three persons). In the Old Testament period (the context of Deuteronomy 6:4), the unity of God would have been assumed. And the trinitarian understanding of God existing in three persons was not well enough developed in James’ day to think that God’s unity (though existing in three persons) was in view.</span></span> This clause may be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is only one God (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Good for you!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is</span> good/correct, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but not enough/sufficient</span>!</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> do well!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Good for you!:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Good for you</em> is literally “You do well” (as in the RSV). James was not completely praising his readers for believing that there is only one God. His point was that such faith is good, but it is <u>not good enough</u>. Even the demons believe that. If their faith was no more than empty words without deeds, it was dead/useless.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase and indicate that such faith is not sufficient are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Put the implied information after 2:19b.

If you must make a choice, choose meaning (a).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>demons:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>demons</em> refers to spirits that are evil and can control people’s actions. The word <em>demons</em> refers to the same type of spirit as the Greek terms that are often translated as “evil spirits” and “unclean spirits.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>demons</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use <u>a general term in your language</u> that refers to spirits that are evil and can control people.</p></li><li><p>Use <u>a specific term in your language</u> that refers to a certain type of spirit.

There is no such thing as faith without good deeds to go with it. It is the good deeds that demonstrate that there is true faith. Faith without good deeds is not true faith at all.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">James used examples from the lives of Rahab and Abraham to show that faith and good deeds always go together.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Faith and good deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you really believe/trust you will also do good deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Real faith is proved by good deeds.</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060002020\" data-endVerseId=\"1060002026\"><h3>Paragraph 2:20–26</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, James gave two examples to show his readers that faith without deeds is useless. He used the examples of Abraham and Rahab from the Old Testament. He argued that it was because of their deeds that both Abraham and Rahab were declared righteous by God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Throughout section 2:14–26, James was contrasting faith <u>without</u> deeds (for example, 2:14, 2:17, 2:18) with faith <u>demonstrated by</u> deeds (2:18). In this paragraph, when James said that Abraham was declared to be righteous “by deeds,” it does not mean by deeds alone. It is implied that Abraham had faith and that this faith was demonstrated by deeds. You may want to put some of this information in the translation or in a footnote. Some suggestions are in the notes on “for what he did” (2:21b) and “by his deeds” (2:24b).</p></div><h4>2:20</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is worthless?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It has two functions. First, it is a rebuke. James was rebuking anyone who thought that it was possible to have true faith without doing good deeds. The second function of this rhetorical question is to introduce the examples that James was about to give from the Old Testament (2:21–25).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this rebuke are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You fool! Do you have to be shown that faith which does nothing is useless? (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You fool! Surely you do not need me to show you that faith without good deeds is worthless.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You fool! I will prove/show to you that faith without good deeds is useless. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Here are two examples.</span></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this rebuke in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>2:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>O foolish man, do you want evidence that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ You<sup>(sing)</sup> fool!

Can you not see/understand that</p></li><li><p>¶ It is crazy for you<sup>(plur)</sup> to think that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O foolish man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>foolish</em> literally means “empty.” Here it is used figuratively to describe a person who has “empty” thoughts. In other words, it is a person who does not think wisely and correctly. This person could be a man or a woman.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, James rebuked the person who disagreed with him. So in Greek, the pronoun <em>man</em> is singular. However, James was also rebuking anyone who believed that it was possible to have faith without good deeds. So, in some languages, it will be more natural to use the plural form “men” or “people” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a term that is natural in your language for a mild rebuke.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You stupid person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You crazy/mad people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> are not thinking carefully</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> are not being wise</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do you still not understand?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do you want evidence:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>do you want evidence</em> is literally “do you want to know?” Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you want to be shown (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Must you be shown (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you have to be told (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do I need to show/tell you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Can’t you see (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>faith without deeds is worthless?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when you<sup>(sing)</sup> have faith/trust but do not do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds, such faith is no good?</p></li><li><p>if a person believes/trusts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Jesus</span> but he does not do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds, that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">type of</span> belief/trust is empty/worthless?</p></li><li><p>believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span> without doing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds is of any use/value.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith without deeds is worthless:</strong> In Greek, the words <em>faith</em> and <em>deeds</em> are nouns.

This example is about Abraham.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Was not our father Abraham justified by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. James used this rhetorical question to emphasize that Abraham was definitely <em>justified</em> or “considered righteous” (NIV) for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t you remember that our ancestor Abraham was declared right with God because of what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

Abraham had lived many generations before James, and all Jews had descended from Abraham. So use a word that indicates an ancestor who was the beginning of a language group or a tribe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our forefather Abraham</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Abraham our long ago ancestor</p></blockquote><h4>2:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>justified by what he did</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>declared to be righteous because of what he did</p></li><li><p>What caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> to call him a straight/just person?

A judge examines the evidence and may then declare that an accused person is “innocent,” “just” or “righteous.” This is equal to saying, “Not guilty.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Commentaries and English versions focus on different aspects of this word:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some focus on the verdict or declaration. <u>God considered/declared Abraham to be righteous</u>. God did this because Abraham’s deeds proved that he was righteous. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our ancestor Abraham was declared right with God because of what he did (NLT96)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Others focus on the evidence and what it showed. <u>Abraham’s deeds showed/proved that he was righteous</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>our ancestor Abraham was shown to be right with God by his actions (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Still others focus on the accused person’s new condition after the verdict. <u>God caused Abraham to be righteous</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Abraham, our ancestor, was made right with God by what he did…. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most commentaries favor (a). So it may be better to translate in a way that follows (a). (Focus (c) is quite different and could be considered a different interpretation.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Was not our ancestor Abraham declared righteous because of what he did…?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Did not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> consider our ancestor Abraham to be just/straight because of his good deeds…?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It was certainly because of what our ancestor Abraham did that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> declared that he was a righteous/good person….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also righteous, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>Issue 2: How to translate the passive verb</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>justified</em> is a passive verb. Some ways to translate this verb are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Was not our ancestor Abraham declared right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> because of what he did…?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It was certainly because of our ancestor Abraham’s good deeds that he was declared righteous.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As an active verb. God was the one who declared Abraham righteous. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Was it not because of what our ancestor Abraham did that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> declared him to be righteous…?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> considered Abraham to be righteous/just because of his good deeds</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by what he did:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by what he did</em> is literally “by works/deeds/actions.” Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>by works (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as a result of what he did (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Throughout 2:14–26, James compared faith with works to faith without works. He did not compare faith to works. When he said <em>by what he did,</em> this implies “by faith together with what he did.” Some ways to make this clear are:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:21a–b</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Include the implied information in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">faith plus</span> works</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of his deeds <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that showed that he had faith</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the kind of faith that was proven by</span> his good deeds</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Include a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In James 2:14–26, James compared faith with deeds to faith alone, that is, faith without deeds. When James wrote that Abraham was declared righteous because of his deeds, he meant “because of his faith with deeds.” Abraham’s deeds demonstrated that he had the kind of faith that can save.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek, the order of words shows that James was emphasizing the phrase <em>by what he did.</em> Consider if there is a way in your language to emphasize these words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Was it not by his action,…that our father Abraham was justified? (REB)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when he took his son Isaac and went to the altar in order to sacrifice him?</p></li><li><p>when he put his son Isaac on the sacrifice place.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when he offered his son Isaac on the altar:</strong> The clause <em>when he offered his son Isaac on the altar</em> means that Abraham put Isaac on an altar and was willing to sacrifice him. But God stopped him. Abraham did not actually kill Isaac.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If a literal translation of this clause will cause people to think that Abraham really did kill Isaac, you should make some adjustments. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when he laid his son Isaac on top of the altar in order to offer him to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may also be helpful to readers who do not know the story to make it clear that Abraham was not acting on his own initiative. He was obeying God’s command. This can be done by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he did not refuse to take his son Isaac to the altar to sacrifice him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>son:</strong> Isaac was old enough to carry the wood for the sacrifice and to understand what was happening. He was a grown youth.

He used the examples of Abraham and Rahab from the Old Testament. He argued that it was because of their deeds that both Abraham and Rahab were declared righteous by God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Throughout section 2:14–26, James was contrasting faith <u>without</u> deeds (for example, 2:14, 2:17, 2:18) with faith <u>demonstrated by</u> deeds (2:18). In this paragraph, when James said that Abraham was declared to be righteous “by deeds,” it does not mean by deeds alone. It is implied that Abraham had faith and that this faith was demonstrated by deeds. You may want to put some of this information in the translation or in a footnote. Some suggestions are in the notes on “for what he did” (2:21b) and “by his deeds” (2:24b).</p></div><h4>2:22</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:22, James explained the lesson that we can learn from the example of Abraham in 2:21. That lesson is that faith and deeds go together.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The GNT, KJV, REB, JBP translate this verse as a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Can’t you see that his faith and his actions were, so to speak, partners—that his faith was implemented by his deed? (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Most other English versions follow the Greek text and translate 2:22 as a statement. You should translate this verse in a way that shows emphasis. This can be done as a rhetorical question or as an emphatic statement.</p><h4>2:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You see that his faith was working with his actions,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(sing)</sup> see/understand that his faith/belief was working together with his deeds,</p></li><li><p>It is clear that Abraham not only trusted in God, he also did <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what God wanted him</span> to do,</p></li><li><p>Do you<sup>(plur)</sup> not see?

This is the person that James has been answering since 2:18c. However, James was also addressing anyone who believed that it was possible to have faith without good deeds. So, in some languages, it will be more natural to use the plural form of “you” here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his faith was working with his actions:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>his faith was working with his actions</em> is literally “his faith was working together with his works.” In some languages, it is not possible to say that two things like <em>faith</em> and <em>actions</em> “work together.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his faith and what he did occurred together at the same time</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Abraham’s trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span> went together with his doing good deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he was not only trusting in God, but he was also doing what God told him to do</p></blockquote><h4>2:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and his faith was perfected by what he did.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and his deeds completed his faith/belief.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> what he did showed that his believing/trusting was real/genuine.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and his faith was perfected by what he did:</strong> The clause <em>his faith was perfected by what he did</em> is passive.

True faith leads to good deeds, so faith is not complete until there are good deeds to go with it. This should not imply that Abraham’s faith was in some way faulty or inadequate before he offered Isaac.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His faith was shown to be genuine by what he did.

Verse 2:23 gives two results of Abraham’s deed of offering Isaac in 2:21. The results were:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the scripture was fulfilled</p></li><li><p>Abraham was called God’s friend</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to connect 2:23 to 2:21–22 are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In this way (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is how</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Scripture:</strong> The phrase <em>the Scripture</em> refers to something that was written in the Old Testament. In this case, the words that James quoted are from Genesis 15:6. These words refer to events that took place about thirty years before Abraham offered Isaac to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>what was written in God’s book</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s written words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the word of God that someone/Moses wrote</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase also occurs in 2:8b. See the note there for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was fulfilled:</strong> There are at least two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>was fulfilled:</em></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that the <u>Scripture was fully shown and demonstrated to be true</u>. According to this interpretation, when Abraham offered Isaac, his action was the best possible illustration that what the scripture said about him was true. His action clearly showed that he believed/trusted God and that he was righteous (Genesis 15:6).</p></li><li><p>It means that the <u>Scripture became true</u>. According to this interpretation, God’s words in Genesis 15:6 were a prophecy. This prophecy was fulfilled when Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice. <em>For example, the GNT says:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And the scripture came true that said,… <em>(NLT, GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions translate this Greek word as “was fulfilled” and probably imply interpretation (2). However, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Most commentators follow this interpretation. The quoted Scripture verse is not a prophecy or promise that needed to come true. It is a statement that was already true when spoken thirty years before Abraham was willing to offer Isaac as a sacrifice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this entire clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so the scripture was shown/demonstrated to be true that says</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This fits/agrees perfectly with the Scripture that says</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>His action is a good/excellent example of the Scripture that says</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so his action perfectly demonstrated his trust in God as described in the scripture that says</p></blockquote><h4>2:23b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 2:23b–c is a quotation of Genesis 15:6.

In other words, he accepted God’s promise as true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">He believed God’s promise because of his deep level of trust in God and his loyalty to God.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he is</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">declared righteous</span> by faith alone</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>faith alone</em> means “faith by itself” or “faith that does not have any good deeds accompanying it.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many people have found this verse difficult, because at first sight it appears to contradict Paul who says, “For we hold that a man is justified by faith apart from works of law.” (Romans 3:28, RSV).However, if we look at the context closely, we see that James and Paul are talking about different things. Paul’s argument in Romans 3 and 4 is intended to show that God justifies Gentiles in the same way as he justifies Jews, on the basis of their faith, not their obedience to the laws of Moses. This means in practice that the fact that many Gentiles have not obeyed the law of Moses (especially in the matter of circumcision) is not a barrier to stop them joining the church.Notice that Paul speaks of <em>works of law</em> not just <em>works.</em> James’ argument has nothing to do with the problem of allowing Gentiles to become members of the church, but it is the problem of those in the church who say they have faith but do not do the deeds that should result from their faith. So for James, <em>works </em>(“deeds”) means “deeds done in obedience to God”. Notice also that James is not against faith, he is against faith without deeds.</span></span> It does not mean that someone can be justified by good deeds instead of faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not by faith without any good deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">he is</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">declared righteous</span> if he only has faith</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God does</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">consider him just/straight</span> if he only believes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">but does not have any good deeds</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this phrase, the emphasis is on the word <em>alone.</em></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the contrast is between “by what he does” in 2:24b and <em>by faith alone</em> here. Try to make this contrast clear in your translation.</p>",

There is no such thing as faith without good deeds to go with it. It is the good deeds that demonstrate that there is true faith. Faith without good deeds is not true faith at all.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">James used examples from the lives of Rahab and Abraham to show that faith and good deeds always go together.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Faith and good deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you really believe/trust you will also do good deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Real faith is proved by good deeds.</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060002020\" data-endVerseId=\"1060002026\"><h3>Paragraph 2:20–26</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, James gave two examples to show his readers that faith without deeds is useless. He used the examples of Abraham and Rahab from the Old Testament. He argued that it was because of their deeds that both Abraham and Rahab were declared righteous by God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Throughout section 2:14–26, James was contrasting faith <u>without</u> deeds (for example, 2:14, 2:17, 2:18) with faith <u>demonstrated by</u> deeds (2:18). In this paragraph, when James said that Abraham was declared to be righteous “by deeds,” it does not mean by deeds alone. It is implied that Abraham had faith and that this faith was demonstrated by deeds. You may want to put some of this information in the translation or in a footnote. Some suggestions are in the notes on “for what he did” (2:21b) and “by his deeds” (2:24b).</p></div><h4>2:25</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:25, James gave a second example from the Old Testament of someone whom God declared to be righteous. This example is about a prostitute called Rahab. Her story is told in the book of Joshua in two parts: Joshua 2:1–24 and Joshua 6:22–25.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies and sent them off on another route?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. James used this rhetorical question to emphasize that Rahab was considered righteous for what she did.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And similarly, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another way? (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rahab the prostitute is another example. She was declared to be right with God by what she did when she hid those messengers and sent them safely away by a different road.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement and a question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Another example is the prostitute Rahab. She hid some messengers and then helped them escape by another road. She also was declared righteous for what she did, right?</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this emphasis in a way that is natural in your language. It is best to use wording that is similar to your translation of 2:21.</p><h4>2:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And similarly, was not Rahab the prostitute also (NET)</p></li><li><p>It was the same with the prostitute called Rahab.</p></li><li><p>Another example is Rahab the prostitute.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the same way:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>In the same way</em> introduces another example that is like the example of Abraham.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Likewise (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Similarly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Another example is (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>even:</em></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>also</u>. God declared Abraham righteous. He also declared Rahab righteous.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrase <em>ὁμοίως</em> … <em>καὶ</em> (“In the same way also” or “Likewise also”) is also found in Matthew 27:41; Luke 5:10; 10:32; 1 Corinthians 7:3–4. In each case, it means “also.”</span></span> For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works <em>(RSV, NJB, ESV, KJV, NASB, REB, NET, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>even</u>. According to this interpretation, this word indicates something unexpected. Here it indicates that Rahab was an unlikely person to be an example of someone who was declared righteous. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Rahab had been a prostitute. <u>But</u> she pleased God… <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the translation of “in the same way” will include the idea of <em>also</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Rahab the prostitute is another example. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If that is the case in your language, you will not need to translate this word explicitly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the prostitute:</strong> A prostitute is a woman who has sex with men in exchange for money. In some cultures, the word referring to such a woman may be considered too vulgar or explicit to be read aloud in church. If that is true in your language, translate this word using a more general term. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>immoral woman</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>woman whose reputation was bad</p></blockquote><h4>2:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>justified by her actions</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>declared to be righteous because of what she did</p></li><li><p>What caused <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> to call her a straight/just person?

You should translate it the same way in both places. (Also, it is almost identical with the phrase in 2:24b.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by her actions:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by her actions</em> here is literally “by works” (as in the RSV). Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of what she did</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of her <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> deeds</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase also occurs in 2:21b.</p><h4>2:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when she welcomed the spies</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when she received into her house the spies,</p></li><li><p>She welcomed the spies into her home (NCV)</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Her good actions were that</span> she hid the Israelites who secretly came to investigate her town.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when she welcomed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>welcomed</em> means “received someone” or “welcomed someone into one’s house.” In this context, it also means “provided a place to stay and hide from the people who wanted to kill them.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when she hid those messengers (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>She welcomed the spies into her home (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>when she gave shelter to those messengers and hid them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the spies:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>spies</em> is literally “messengers” (as in the RSV). In this context, it refers to men who were secretly looking at a town they hoped to conquer. Then they returned to report back to their commander.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Israelites who secretly came to investigate her town</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Jewish men sent to secretly inspect her town <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to see the best way to attack it</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:25d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and sent them off on another route?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and then sent them off by another way?</p></li><li><p>and then showed them a different way to leave.</p></li><li><p>Then she caused them to leave another way <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that their enemies would not find them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sent them off on another route:</strong> In Joshua 2:15–16, Rahab helped the spies escape by:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>hanging a rope out of her window that they used to descend outside the city wall.</p></li><li><p>counseling them to go into the hills and hide for three days before they returned home.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>route</em> can refer to a “road” or more figuratively a “way.” A number of English versions translate this word as “road”. (See the GNT, NLT, for example.) However, in this context it more likely refers to letting the spies out of the window by a rope.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Support for understanding the word in this way includes:(a) The Greek verb, <em>ἐκβάλλω </em>(throw/cast/drive out, send away), goes better with the descent out the window than simply traveling home by a different road.(b) The Greek word <em>ἕτερος </em>(translated as “different” or “other”) usually refers to “other/another” of a different kind rather than of the same kind. So it goes better with going out of the window as opposed to the gate rather than taking one road as opposed to another road. (Contrast Matthew 2:12 where <em>αλλος</em> is used instead of <em>ἕτερος</em>.)(c) The common Greek idiom for taking a road uses the preposition <em>e¸v </em>followed by “road” in the accusative case. In this verse, “another way/road” is in the dative case. (See, for example, Matthew 10:5, 22:10.)(d) According to Joshua 2:16, Rahab did not counsel the spies to return by a different road. She counseled them to go off the road into the hills to escape notice for three days before returning home (presumably by the same road by which they came).</span></span> Or, this word may refer to both escaping out of the window and then hiding in the hills.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have a word or phrase that can refer to both escaping out of the window and going into the hills, you could use it here. Otherwise be sure that your translation can refer to the spies going out of the window.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sent them out by another way (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>showed them a different way to leave (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>helped them to escape by getting out of the city in/by an unusual/secret way</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some people are not familiar with this Old Testament story. So you may have to make some of the information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then she sent them home a different way <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that their enemies would not find them</span>.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:25a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be clearer to say what Rahab did before saying that God considered her righteous because of it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>25a</sup>Another example is Rahab the prostitute. <sup>25c</sup>When Israelite spies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">came to her town</span>, she welcomed them. <sup>25d</sup>And she advised them to depart another way. <sup>25b</sup>It was because of what she did at that time that God considered her also to be a righteous person.</p></blockquote></div>",

James warned that it is a serious matter when a person becomes a teacher in the church.</p></div><h4>3:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ My brothers, not many of you<sup>(plur)</sup> should become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">religious</span> teachers,</p></li><li><p>¶ My fellow believers, only a few of you<sup>(plur)</sup> should teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the church</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Not many of you should become teachers:</strong> In Greek, this sentence is literally “be not many teachers.” Many ambitious people wanted to have the honor of being a religious teacher. However, James told them that not all of them should be eager to become teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this sentence are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not many of you should become teachers in the church (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we should not all try to become teachers (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>only a few of you should try to become teachers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Not many of you:</strong> The phrase <em>Not many of you</em> means “only some of you,” or “only a few of you.” Most of James’ readers should not try to become teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>teachers:</strong> The word <em>teachers</em> refers to those who had authority to teach in the church. They instructed other Christians in the meaning of what God had said in his word and how they should live.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here the word <em>teachers</em> does not refer to a teacher in a school. This word refers only to people who teach the word of God and the good news about Jesus Christ. If many people in your area would confuse this and think of teachers of other subjects, then it may be necessary to make explicit what the teachers teach in this context. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>teachers in the church (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the word of God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Christian faith/belief</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my brothers:</strong> The phrase <em>my brothers</em> refers to other believers in Christ to whom James was writing. In the time of James, all the teachers were men. So here, this phrase does not include women as it does in 1:2a, 1:16, 1:19a, 2:1a, 2:5a, and 2:14a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My fellow believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My Christian friends</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My relatives <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here James used the phrase <em>my brothers</em> to introduce the topic of the need for believers to control their speech. If you have another way in your language to introduce a change of topic, you may use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the BSB places the phrase <em>my brothers</em> in the middle of 3:1. This follows the Greek text. In some languages, it may be more natural to place it at the beginning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>My friends, not many of you should become teachers… (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This same phrase occurs in 1:2a.</p><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because you know that</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you<sup>(plur)</sup> know that</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">already</span> know that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because you know that:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>because you know that</em> is literally “knowing that.” This phrase introduces the reason for the statement in 3:1a. In some languages, it will be natural to follow the example of the BSB.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate the phrase “knowing that” are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you know (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Remember (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you may be certain (REB)</p></blockquote><h4>3:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>we who teach will be judged more strictly.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>we<sup>(excl)</sup> teachers will be judged more strictly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than others</span>.</p></li><li><p>God will evaluate/examine us<sup>(excl)</sup> who teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s word</span> more severely/harshly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than those who are not teachers</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we who teach:</strong> The word <em>we</em> refers to all teachers of God’s word. It includes James. It does not include all of James’ readers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will be judged more strictly:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>will be judged more strictly</em> means “will be examined and punished according to a stricter standard.” This refers to the day when God will judge all human beings. Teachers in the church will be judged more strictly than those who are not teachers. God will judge what they teach and how well their actions correspond to what they teach.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here, the word <em>judged</em> does not refer to God judging unbelievers and condemning them eternally to hell.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be judged by a much higher standard (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will be evaluated/assessed more strictly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than those who are not teachers</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will receive more severe punishment <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if we fail</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB uses a passive verb. Some ways to translate this word are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will be judged with greater strictness than others (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will judge us more strictly</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate <em>judged</em> as a noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will receive more severe judgment</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

It is because the most difficult thing for a human being to control is what he says. If he can control what he says, he can control everything he does. James illustrated his point by a comparison with how a man controls a horse.</p></div><h4>3:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>We all stumble in many ways.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ We<sup>(incl)</sup> all frequently do wrong things.</p></li><li><p>¶ We<sup>(incl)</sup> all often sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 3:2 is connected to 3:1 by a Greek conjunction that is often translated as “for” (as in the RSV). Here it indicates that 3:2 is the basis for the warning in 3:1. Verse 3:2 also introduces the topic of speech. This topic applies to all people, not just to teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions are like the BSB and do not translate this conjunction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>We all:</strong> The phrase <em>We all</em> refers to all human beings. Here it does not just refer to teachers. Therefore, the word <em>We</em> includes James’ readers as well as James himself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>stumble:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>stumble</em> is used figuratively. In this context of Christian believers, it refers to doing something wrong or sinning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make many mistakes (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do…wrong things (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here this word does not mean “physically slip and fall.” This word also occurs in 2:10b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in many ways:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>in many ways</em> can mean:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“many times.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>often (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>“in many matters/ways.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in many ways (NJB)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The choice of one of these meanings does not need to exclude the other. If someone sins many times, it is likely that he also sins in many matters. If he sins in many matters, he also sins often. If possible, translate this word in a way that can include both meanings.</p><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If anyone is never at fault in what he says,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If anyone does not sin in his speech,</p></li><li><p>The person who never says anything wrong</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If anyone is never at fault in what he says:</strong> This clause means “if anyone never says anything wrong.” It is not clear whether or not James thought that there are such people. It is best to leave it open in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But if a person never makes a mistake in what he says (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>If people never said anything wrong (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the person who never sins in his speech</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is never at fault:</strong> The words <em>is…at fault</em> translate the same Greek word that the BSB translates as “stumble” earlier in the verse. If possible, use the same expression in both places. Here James was talking about sins such as slander, insults, angry words, lying, and cursing. These words do not refer to speaking when it is not one’s turn, or making grammatical mistakes.</p><h4>3:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he is a perfect man,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that person is perfect/mature,</p></li><li><p>is perfect/complete.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he:</strong> The pronoun <em>he</em> refers back to “anyone” in 3:2b. In some languages, it is more natural to use another word or phrase here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>such a person</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Depending on how you translated “anyone” in 3:2b, you may have to translate this word as “they,” “you,” or “we.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is a perfect man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>perfect</em> also means “complete” or “mature” (CEV).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This word also occurs in 1:4. There, the BSB translates it as “mature.”</p><h4>3:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>able to control his whole body.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and he is</span> able to bridle his entire body.</p></li><li><p>He is able to control himself completely.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>able to control his whole body:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to control</em> is literally “to bridle” (as in the RSV). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>able to bridle his whole body (ESV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word refers to the way people control horses using rope or straps around the head and mouth. These straps are called a bridle. (See the illustration above.) The verb is also “bridle.” (For example, “He bridles his horse.”)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here this word is a metaphor. James compared someone who is able to control his body to a horse that is bridled. They are similar in that both can be controlled. Both can be taught to obey.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This metaphor continues in 3:3a. So, if possible, you should translate the metaphor here. If it is not possible, you can translate the meaning without a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>able to control the entire body (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>able to restrain/manage his whole body</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This same Greek word occurs in 1:26.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his whole body:</strong> The phrase <em>his whole body</em> refers to “a person’s entire being.” It refers to “everything that he does.” James was saying that if a person can bridle/control what he says, he will have no difficulty controlling what he does with the rest of his body. He can control everything he thinks and does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every part of his body (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everything he does (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every other part of his personality (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>control themselves in every other way (NLT96)</p></blockquote>",

Human beings are like horses: by controlling the mouth one can control the whole body.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be natural to introduce this verse with a phrase that indicates that it is an illustration. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">To illustrate:</span> when we put bits…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Consider how</span> we put bits…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is like</span> putting bits….</p></blockquote><h4>3:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>When we put bits into the mouths of horses</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If we<sup>(incl)</sup> put a bit into a horse’s mouth</p></li><li><p>People put bridles/harnesses on horses/oxen</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For instance,</span> when they tie a rope around an animal’s neck</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>When we put bits into the mouths of horses:</strong> In Greek, the illustration of the horse is introduced with the word “if.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a textual problem at the beginning of 3:3a. At this point in the Greek text, the manuscript copies do not all agree. The difference is only one Greek letter: <em>ει δε </em>(“and if”) and <em>ιδε </em>(“look!”). The textual issue is further complicated by a question of spelling. The oldest manuscripts were written with no spaces between the words, so the variant readings are <em>ειδε </em>and <em>ιδε.</em> But <em>ει </em>and <em>ι</em> were pronounced similarly and so were also often confused in writing. So either <em>ειδε </em>or <em>ιδε </em>could be understood as <em>ει δε </em>(“and if”) or <em>ιδε </em>(“behold”). The reading <em>ιδε </em>has some strong arguments in its favor. Mayor, pages 104–106, has the fullest defense of <em>ιδε </em>“behold”, though he reads <em>ιδε γαρ,</em> following Codex Sinaiticus. Other commentators that support this reading are: Ropes, page 229; Adamson (1976), page 141; and Laws, page 146. Among other writers <em>ιδε </em>is accepted by Blass-Debrunner-Funk, §467; Moulton-Howard, Vol. 2, page 77; F. Field, Notes on the Translation of the New Testament, page 237. The reading <em>ει δε </em>is accepted by most English versions and the following commentators: Alford, page 303; Huther, page 146; Hiebert, page 209; Moo (1985), page 121; Martin, pages 103, 110; and McCartney, page 194. Davids (1982), page 138, has the fullest defense of this reading. See also Metzger, <em>A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament,</em> 1971, pages 681–682. It is the reading of the modern editions of the Greek text. The KJV follows yet another variant reading, <em>ιδου </em>(‘behold’).</span></span> The BSB translates this word as <em>When </em>. Some ways to introduce this illustration are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide their whole bodies. (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We put bits in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, and we have control over everything they do. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>By putting a bit into the mouth of a horse, we can turn the horse in different directions. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we put:</strong> The phrase <em>we put</em> is a general statement concerning what people habitually do. In some languages, it may be more natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people put</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they put</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you put</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>bits into the mouths of horses:</strong> In Greek, the words <em>bits, mouths,</em> and <em>horses</em> are plural. In some languages, it will be more natural to use singular words. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We put a bit into the mouth of a horse (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>bits:</strong>The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>bits</em> is the noun form of the verb “bridle” in 3:2d. A bridle is a rope or strap that goes over the horse’s head to control it. (See the illustration of the horse above.) Attached to the bridle is a piece of metal that passes through the horse’s mouth. In English, there is a specific word for this piece of metal. It is called a bit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word used here normally refers to the whole bridle: both the straps and the piece of metal. But if your language has a specific word for the piece of metal that is put into the horse’s mouth, you should use it here. That is what the BSB has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this word are:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use a specific term for the thing that is put in the mouth of a horse to control it. For example, most English versions say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bits</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a more general term for the things that people use to control a horse. In some cases, it will be more natural to leave the phrase <em>into the mouths</em> untranslated. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bridles</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>reins on the head</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a descriptive phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When we put something into the mouths of horses to guide them</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a cultural substitute. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rope around the neck</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>ring in the nose/snout</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>horses:</strong> Some people are not familiar with <em>horses</em> and have no word for them in their language. If that is the case in your language, you can:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use a generic term and describe the function of a horse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an animal one can ride</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Substitute a different animal that a person can ride and put a bridle on. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>an ox</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a camel</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to make them obey us,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to make it obey us<sup>(incl)</sup>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order</span> to cause/force them to do what they want.</p></li><li><p>to make it obey,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to make them obey us:</strong> The clause <em>to make them obey us</em> is the purpose of using a bit and a bridle.

The same Greek words are found in 3:2d. When translating this phrase, it is best to use similar words in both verses so that the reader can see the connection between them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <u>whole body</u> of the person (3:2d)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the <u>whole body</u> of the horse (3:3c)</p></blockquote>",

Use a natural expression for introducing an illustration in a way that gets the attention of the readers/hearers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Also, listen to this example of ships</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Or think of a ship (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ships:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>ships</em> may refer to any kind of ship or boat. In this verse, James mentions the wind (3:4c). So it is clear that here he was thinking of sailing ships.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A sailing ship is a large boat that uses the power of the wind to move it across the water. One or more sails (very large pieces of strong cloth) are attached to tall posts on the ship. The wind blows against the cloth which in turn pushes the whole boat.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>big <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sailing</span> ships</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>huge canoes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with sails</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>very large boats</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to use a singular word “ship” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If the idea of a large boat with sails is not known by the people of your region, you may want to include an illustration at this place in your translation.</p><h4>3:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Although they are so large</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Even though they are very big,</p></li><li><p>Even if a boat is very big</p></li><li><p>A man can control a large canoe</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:4b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds:</strong> In this clause, James listed two things that make it hard to control a ship: its size and the powerful winds that blow on it.</p><h4>3:4c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and are driven by strong winds,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and strong winds drive/force them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to move</span> along,</p></li><li><p>and it is moved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> by strong winds,</p></li><li><p>that a powerful wind pushes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are driven by strong winds:</strong> The clause <em>are driven by strong winds</em> indicates that it takes strong winds to cause these ships to move.

It is attached to the back or the side of the boat. In ancient boats, it consisted of a wide, flat piece of wood attached to the end of a long pole. The man who steered the boat held one end of the pole and the other end with the flat piece of wood went down into the water. By pushing or pulling the pole, he was able to change the direction that the boat was going.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>rudder</em> are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a specific word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rudder</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a word for the piece of wood that moves and turns canoes.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a small steering paddle/thing</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Each ship had one <em>rudder.</em> If you have spoken of “ships” in the plural in 3:4a–b, you may need to speak of <em>rudders</em> in the plural.</p><h4>3:4e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:4e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>wherever the pilot is inclined.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The pilot uses it to turn the ship in the direction he wishes to go.</p></li><li><p>to go wherever the boatman decides.</p></li><li><p>to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">make it</span> go wherever he wants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pilot:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pilot</em> refers to the man who steers a boat using a rudder.

If you have been talking about “ships,” consider whether you will need to say “pilot” or “pilots” here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is inclined:</strong> James emphasizes that it is the man who steers the boat who determines its direction. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the direction the pilot wants to cause it to go</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wherever the pilot chooses to go (NLT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:4a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be helpful to reorder this verse so that 3:4b–c comes after 3:4d–e. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup>For another example, think about a sailing ship. <sup>4e</sup>The pilot directs it wherever he wishes <sup>4d</sup>by means of a tiny rudder, <sup>4b</sup>even though the ship may be very large <sup>4c</sup>and only strong winds can move it.</p></blockquote></div>",

Like a fire, the tongue can be destructive.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, James made a general statement that applies to everyone. Some languages make general statements in other ways. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A person’s tongue</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your tongues</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Our tongues</p></blockquote><h4>3:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The tongue also is a fire,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A person’s tongue is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a fire.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">words that we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">say with our</span> tongues/mouths are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as dangerous/harmful as</span> a fire.</p></li><li><p>A fire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">destroys things</span>, and the mouth is also like that.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The tongue also is a fire:</strong> The clause <em>The tongue also is a fire</em> is a metaphor. In this metaphor, the tongue is compared to a fire. Some ways that they are similar are that both can destroy things and cannot be controlled.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a literal translation of this metaphor may be difficult to understand. Some other ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the tongue is like a fire (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile and make explicit the way that they are similar. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the tongue can destroy like a fire</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the words that the tongue says are like a fire because they can destroy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The words that we say with our tongue/mouth can cause much harm just like a fire can cause much harm</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>also:</strong> The word <em>also</em> indicates that, in addition to ordinary fires, there is another thing that has characteristics similar to a fire. It is the tongue.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>too</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as well</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>similarly</p></blockquote><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a world of wickedness among the parts of the body.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span> the part of the body that is very evil.</p></li><li><p>Among the parts of the body, the tongue/mouth has great, evil power.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Some versions begin a new sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is a world… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a world of wickedness:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a world of wickedness</em> means that the tongue can do much evil.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Differences of interpretation regarding the meaning of “world of evil” are reflected in English versions and discussed at length in commentaries. The two main views are:(1) “world” is used in the common biblical sense of the evil world-system that includes all that opposes God and his ways, and(2) “world” is used as sort of a metaphor for something huge that contains all sorts of things.According to interpretation (1), James was saying that the tongue is the part of our body that has the greatest tendency to serve the evil world-system that is opposed to God. According to interpretation (2), James was highlighting the tongue’s great capacity for all sorts of evil. The majority of English versions (which translate in a way similar to “the tongue … is a world of evil”) will be understood to follow interpretation (2). The majority of commentators (including Davids, page 142; Johnson, page 259; Laws, pages 149–150; Moo (2000), page 157; McCartney, page 187; Mitton, pages 126–127; Mayor, pages 114–115, Martin, page 114; SSA, pages 96–97; Translator’s Handbook, page 109) favor interpretation (1). They argue that this sense of “world” is common to the Bible and particularly to James, while the meaning of “world” according to interpretation (2) is extremely rare. The definite article “the” preceding “world,” they say, also supports understanding “world” in its common and specific sense as the evil world system.In the notes, we have chosen not to present this as an interpretation issue for the following reasons:a) the difference between the two interpretations is slight when one considers the meaning of the metaphor: the tongue has great capacity for evil.b) Many languages do not use the word “world” in a figurative sense to mean what is suggested for either interpretation (1) or (2). So giving translation models for each that do not use the word “world” is quite difficult.c) The idea that the tongue “represents” the evil world (as some would translate interpretation (1), see REB, for example) and the idea that the tongue is a huge sphere/realm where evil takes place are both quite abstract. We preferred to present a more concrete and simple model for translation.</span></span> Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is very, very evil</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is an evil power (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is against God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>among the parts of the body:</strong> James was comparing the tongue with the other parts of the body, like the nose, fingers, and legs. He said that it was the tongue that was causing the trouble.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages do not have a general word or expression for “part of the body.” Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in our bodies</p></blockquote><h4>3:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It pollutes the whole person,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It contaminates/dirties a person’s whole body/being.</p></li><li><p>The tongue/mouth can spread evil throughout our<sup>(incl)</sup> entire soul/heart.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It pollutes:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pollutes</em> literally means “stains.” Here it is used in a figurative sense to refer to the tongue’s negative, evil effects on a person’s inner character.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it corrupts (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it completely contaminates (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It stains (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It can poison (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and spreading evil (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it makes dirty</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">A related Greek word that the BSB translates as “polluted” occurs in 1:27c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the whole person:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the whole person</em> is literally “all the body.” In this context, it is referring to the inner, moral being of the person, including his thoughts and emotions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the whole body</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the parts of your being</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the whole inner being</p></blockquote><h4>3:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>sets the course of his life on fire,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It causes his whole life to burn up</p></li><li><p>It can destroy our<sup>(incl)</sup> whole life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sets the course of his life on fire:</strong> This clause is another description of the destructive power of the tongue. Here, James again used the metaphor of fire.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two main ways to interpret this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a <u>person’s</u> entire existence from birth to death. According to this interpretation, the evils of a person’s tongue have a destructive effect on every part of his life.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Huther, page 157; Mayor, page 113; Mitton, page 128; Hiebert, pages 217–218; Laws, page 150; Davids (1982), page 143; Moo (1985), page 125; Martin, page 115.</span></span> For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sets a person’s entire life on fire <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, REB, NASB, NLT, CEV, NCV, GW, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the events of <u>nature</u>, for example, from one season to the next. According to this interpretation, the evils of a person’s tongue have a destructive effect on the whole created world.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, page 306; Ropes, page 235.</span></span> For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the cycle of nature <em>(KJV, RSV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">From the general context of James’ letter, it seems that he is concerned with relationships between human beings, not the rest of the created world. This is the view of the majority of commentators. Therefore it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sets a person’s entire life on fire (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>burns every aspect of his life</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>turns his whole life to ashes</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without keeping the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>ruins the whole life of a person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>is able to destroy his entire life</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and is itself set on fire by hell.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>with fire that comes from hell.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is like</span> the fire of hell is in/on it.</p></li><li><p>Hell has given it this power.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and is itself set on fire by hell:</strong> The pronoun <em>itself</em> refers to the tongue. The tongue gets its fire from hell. Hell is the source of the tongue’s destructive fire/power. This implies that hell has given to the tongue the power to ruin lives.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause does not mean that the tongue itself is burned or destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is as if</span> the fire of hell is in it</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with flames that come from hell itself (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and it gets its power to destroy from hell itself</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by hell:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hell</em> refers to the place where Satan, his demons, and ungodly people will be punished after the final Day of Judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>eternal fire</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the place of unending fire</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Satan</p></blockquote>",

Older English versions translate this conjunction as “For” (as in the RSV). However, this verse is not giving a reason for something. This conjunction introduces some further thoughts on the dangers of the tongue. Most modern English versions do not use any connecting word here. If your language uses a word to introduce further thoughts on a topic, then you may want to use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some examples of how to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Furthermore</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Moreover</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In addition</p></blockquote><h4>3:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and creatures of the sea</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Every kind of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wild</span> animal, flying thing, crawling thing, and sea creature</p></li><li><p>¶ As for every kind of wild animal, bird, snake, and fish,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and creatures of the sea:</strong> In this verse, all living creatures are divided into four categories:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>animals</p></li><li><p>birds</p></li><li><p>reptiles</p></li><li><p>creatures of the sea</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Different languages divide living creatures in different ways. So it may not be possible to find exact words in your language for each of these four categories. In some languages, it is more natural to divide living creatures in some other way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wild animals, birds, snakes, and fish</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>animals that walk, animals that crawl, animals that fly, and animals that swim</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>every kind of moving thing, even birds and snakes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have only two or three categories. Use the divisions that are natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>animals:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>animals</em> refers to certain four-footed animals that live on land. It could include the animals that people normally keep under their control like cows, sheep, goats, and dogs. However, the animals in focus here are those that normally live in the wild and that men go out to hunt. These are animals like deer, antelopes, wild pigs, and so on.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wild animals (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bush animals</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>birds:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>birds</em> includes all kinds of birds. James may have wanted to include other flying things as well like bats, locusts, and other insects.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reptiles:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>reptiles</em> refers to all creatures that move about close to the ground. This includes creatures that slide along the ground such as snakes. It also includes creatures that run close to the ground such as lizards.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>creatures that crawl on the ground (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>snakes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>creatures of the sea:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>creatures of the sea</em> includes all creatures that live in water. This includes fish, whales, eels, crabs, and so on.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>creatures that…swim in the sea (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fish (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>are being tamed and have been tamed by man,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>is tamed/subdued and has been tamed/subdued by people.</p></li><li><p>human beings are controlling them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span>, and they have been controlling them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for a long time</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are being tamed and have been tamed:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>tamed</em> occurs twice in 3:7b. This verb is a general word that means “gained control” over a creature. “To gain control” over an animal is: <em>(a)</em> to tame it to be a pet, <em>(b)</em> to make it work for someone, <em>(c)</em> to stop it from eating crops, and even <em>(d)</em> to kill it and eat it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>F. Field, <em>Notes on the Translation of the NT </em>, pages 237–238. Mitton, pages 129–130, says, “[The Greek word] would represent also man’s power to destroy such animals as threatened human welfare, as well as to compel other animals to submit to domestic service.”</span></span> The English word “tamed” is perhaps too specific a word here. It covers only part of the meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>subdued (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>caused to be submissive</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>made to obey</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>controlled</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>tamed</em> occurs twice, but the second time the tense is different. This is to make the point that taming creatures has always happened. Men are doing it today, and they have been doing it since the world began.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Both of these verbs are passive. There are at least two ways to translate them:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Use passive verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>can be subdued and have been subdued by man (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use active verbs. This may involve reordering 3:7a–b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>People can tame every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and fish, and they have tamed them. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> means “mankind” or the “human race.” Here the focus is on all humans as a group.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>humans</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>human beings</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:7a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to put 3:7b before 3:7a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>Human beings are subduing and have subdued <sup>7a</sup>all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and creatures of the sea.</p></blockquote></div>",

People are able to tame all of the creatures mentioned in 3:7, but no one can tame the tongue.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>However</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Yet (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In contrast</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>no man can tame the tongue:</strong> James was referring to people being unable to control their own tongues. In some languages, it may be best to supply that implicit information by using a pronoun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>no man can tame his <span data-bnType=\"implied\">own</span> tongue.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>no man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> is the same word that James used in 3:7b. Here the focus is on each individual human. So it refers to women as well as to men.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no human being (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no one (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no person</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tame:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>tame</em> is the same word as in 3:7b. If it is unnatural to use the same word here, you may be able to use a word meaning “control.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But our tongues get out of control. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the tongue:</strong> As in 3:5a, <em>the tongue</em> represents the words that we speak with our tongues. In some languages, “the lips” or “the mouth” represent the words that a person says. Use the same expression here as in 3:5a.</p><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is a restless evil,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is wild/uncontrollable and evil.</p></li><li><p>It is an evil thing that does not stay under control.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It is a restless evil:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>restless</em> primarily means “unstable.” The sense of “unstable” in this context includes:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The tongue is <u>restless</u>. It does not rest but is always busy doing evil. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is restless and evil (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is a pest that will not keep still (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The tongue is <u>uncontrollable</u>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is also a textual variant, <em>ἀκατάσχετον,</em> that means “uncontrollable.” It is not clear whether versions that translate “uncontrollable” are following this textual variant or whether they are simply interpreting the sense of <em>ἀκατάστατον </em>(“unstable”) to mean “uncontrollable” in this context. The KJV is clearly following the variant reading as found in the Textus Receptus. Most other English versions that translate “uncontrollable” are probably interpreting <em>ἀκατάστατον </em>in that way.</span></span> It cannot be controlled. No one can stop it from doing evil. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is evil and uncontrollable (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The two meanings are close. Something that is restless and determined to do evil is probably also uncontrollable. If you have a word that is close in meaning to both “restless” and “uncontrollable,” it would be good to use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>always busy doing evil</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>constantly doing wrong</p></blockquote><h4>3:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>full of deadly poison.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is full of poison that causes death.</p></li><li><p>It is harmful/painful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like the</span> poison/venom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of a deadly snake</span>.</p></li><li><p>It does terrible harm <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>full of deadly poison:</strong> The phrase <em>full of deadly poison</em> is a metaphor. In this metaphor, James compared the human tongue to the mouth of a poisonous snake. (Compare Psalm 58:3–4 and Psalm 140:3 for the thought.) One way that they are similar is that both can do great harm.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least three ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. If it is not difficult to understand the metaphor in your language, then you should keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>always spreading deadly poison (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile and add the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>very harmful like the venom from a poisonous snake</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a source of terrible harm/pain</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

Both good words and bad words come out of the same mouth. This is something that should not happen. It is also contrary to nature.</p></div><h4>3:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ We<sup>(incl)</sup> praise/bless our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord and Father with our tongues,</p></li><li><p>¶ You<sup>(plur)</sup> use your lips/mouths/words to praise the one who is our<sup>(incl)</sup> Master and our Father.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>With the tongue:</strong> As in 3:5a, <em>the tongue</em> represents the words that we speak with our tongues. In some languages, “the lips” or “the mouth” represent the words that a person says.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we bless our Lord and Father:</strong> This clause is a general statement. In some languages, it is more natural to use a different noun or pronoun in place of the pronoun <em>we.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people praise their Lord and Father</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> praise your Lord and Father</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we bless:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>we bless</em> means “speak well” of God, “praise” God or “thank” God. It contrasts with the phrase “curse men” in 3:9b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">James was perhaps thinking of prayer here. Jews, and no doubt Jewish Christians, started many of their prayers of praise to God with the words “Blessed are you.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we speak well of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we praise (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We…give thanks (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See bless, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our Lord and Father:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some manuscripts and the KJV have “God” instead of “Lord.” “Lord” has the strongest manuscript support and is followed by the majority of English versions.</span></span> The phrase <em>our Lord and Father</em> contains two titles that both refer to the one God. Make sure your translation clearly refers to <u>one</u> God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to do this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who is our Lord and our Father</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our Lord who is our Father</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>our Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “one who is in authority,” or “master.” Here it refers to God. He is the one who has supreme authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>Lord</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our Master</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our Owner</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our supreme Chief/Leader</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God,</span> our Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also Lord in the Glossary.</p><h4>3:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and with it we curse men,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and we<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> speak evil against people with our tongues,</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> use your lips/mouths/words to condemn your fellow humans,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we curse:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>we curse</em> means “we speak against a person.” It means “we call on God (or another spiritual power) to do harm to someone.” It is stronger than insulting or abusing someone. It is the opposite of blessing a person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we speak evil against</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we condemn with words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we call <span data-bnType=\"implied\">upon God</span> to harm</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>men:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>men</em> refers to human beings in general. It includes women and children. Check how you translated this same word in 3:7b and 3:8a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>other human beings</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is particularly important here to use a word that includes all human beings. This is so that your translation does not convey the wrong meaning that only men “have been made in God’s likeness” (in 3:9c).</p><h4>3:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who have been made in God’s likeness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even though they were made/created to be like God.</p></li><li><p>in spite of the fact that God made/created them to be like himself.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The clause in 3:9c points out why it is wrong for the same tongue to praise God and then curse men. It is wrong because humans are made in God’s likeness. Doing such a thing is praising God and then cursing his likeness.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who have been made in God’s likeness:</strong> The BSB and most other English versions translate 3:9c as a relative clause. In some languages, translating this clause as a relative clause may imply that there are other people who have not been created in God’s likeness. It may also hide the point that cursing men is cursing God’s likeness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause to give the correct meaning are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and they have been made in God’s likeness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>though they are made in God’s likeness (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in spite of the fact that they are created in God’s likeness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have been made in God’s likeness:</strong> The BSB translates the Greek verb here as the passive verb <em>have been made.</em> Some ways to translate this verb are:</p><ul data-indent=\"3\"><li><p>Use a passive verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who were created to be like God (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an active verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whom God made like himself (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>in God’s likeness:</strong> The phrase <em>in God’s likeness</em> indicates that God made people to resemble him in certain ways. Theologians debate as to what ways people are <em>in God’s likeness.</em> Some of the ways they suggest are: people can love, talk, create, reason, make moral choices, rule God’s creation, and appreciate beauty. You will not want to say all this in your translation. But avoid translating this in a way that will make readers think that people <u>look like</u> God. It is speaking more of their character and abilities, not of their physical appearance.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are in the examples above.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase comes from Genesis 1:26.</p>",

So it may not be possible to translate this clause literally. It may be necessary to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We use our mouths both to bless and to curse.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The same mouth speaks praises and curses.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with our tongues we speak both praises and curses (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blessing and cursing:</strong> When you translate the words <em>blessing</em> and <em>cursing</em>, use words that are the same as, or related to, the words you used in 3:9. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>blessing and cursing (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you speak well of one and evil against the other</p></blockquote><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>My brothers, this should not be!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>My brothers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and sisters</span>, we<sup>(incl)</sup> should not do this.</p></li><li><p>My fellow believers, that is not right/good.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>My brothers:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>My brothers</em> refers to other believers in Christ.

You may have another way in your language to soften a rebuke and could use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This same phrase occurs at 1:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text actually places the phrase <em>My brothers</em> in the middle of “this should not be.” In some languages, it may be more natural to place it at the end. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This should not be so, my friends. (REB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>this should not be!:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>this should not be</em> is a strong rebuke.

This means that good people should not produce curses.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question.

However, the important part of the meaning here is not the exact kind of tree or fruit. The point is the fact that a tree cannot bear fruit that is not of its own kind.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">James used these particular trees and fruits in his illustration because they were common in the region where he lived. Figs were a delicious fruit that was typical of the good things of that land. Olives were important as the main source oil used for cooking in that region. Grapes were squeezed to obtain juice, which was made into wine, the main drink of the region.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to translate these terms is to use trees and fruit that are common in your area.

The point here is not only that one kind of spring cannot produce water of a different kind. The point is that a bad spring cannot produce good water.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The translation of KJV “so can no fountain [that is, spring] both yield salt water and fresh” depends on different manuscript copies from the ones followed by the modern versions. The text followed by KJV says the same thing in other words as 3:11, but the text that BSB and the other modern versions follow says that bad cannot produce good. This is an advance in James’ argument, preparing the way for the next section 3:13–18. Therefore it seems likely that the text followed here by KJV is not original, and so it is not recommended.</span></span> The implied information is that bad people cannot produce good praise to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>salt spring:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>salt spring</em> is literally “salty.” (The noun <em>spring</em> is not in the Greek text here but is implied from 3:11.) This word is different than the word meaning “bitter” (BSB “salt”) in 3:11. But the meaning is similar. It refers to a spring that always produces water that is not good to drink.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a spring whose water tastes salty</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a spring that produces water not fit to drink</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Israel, there are springs that are so full of minerals that it is not safe to drink the water. If salt springs are unknown in your area, you may want to replace <em>salt spring</em> with something that is more common in your area. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a salty pool (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a salt pond (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a well that gives foul water</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fresh water:</strong> Here the phrase <em>fresh water</em> refers to water that tastes good.

This means that these two words mean almost the same thing. In some languages, both words can be translated by one emphatic word or phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>truly wise</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>is wise:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>wise</em> here describes a person who lives in a way that agrees with what God wants. Wisdom in the Bible is concerned with choosing between right and wrong actions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has wisdom</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>thinking is good</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>makes good/godly choices</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>understanding:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>understanding</em> here describes a person who knows what is right and what is wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has insight</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is perceptive</p></blockquote><h4>3:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Let him show it by his good conduct,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do,</span> show it by/through the way you behave/live.</p></li><li><p>he should show this by/in his good living.</p></li><li><p>must prove it and behave well.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Let him show it:</strong> The clause <em>Let him show it</em> is a command. The pronoun <em>him</em> refers to the person in 3:13a who is wise and understanding. The verb <em>show</em> here means “prove to everyone” or “demonstrate.” The pronoun <em>it</em> refers to the claim to be wise in 3:13a. So this clause means:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He must show/prove to others that he is wise and understanding</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must do what is wise and understanding, then people will know/see it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Your translation of this clause must correspond with the way you translated “Who is…” in 3:13a.

(NET)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The NET accurately follows the Greek grammar here by translating “his works” as the object of the verb “show.” However, this solution makes it difficult to naturally connect the phrase “by his good conduct” (3:13b) to the rest of the sentence.</span></span></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deeds done in…humility:</strong> The clause <em>deeds done in…humility</em> means “good deeds that are done with a humble attitude.” In other words, the deeds are done modestly and not proudly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>It is not clear from the Greek text whether the phrase <em>in the humility that comes from wisdom</em> is to be connected to the word “show” or whether it is to be connected to the word “deeds.” In other words, does it mean that when the man shows the deeds he has done, he is to do it humbly, not proudly? Or does it mean that the deeds he has done must be deeds that are done humbly, not selfishly? The second interpretation makes better sense in the context and is accepted by BSB, GNT, NIV, and many commentators.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>deeds:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>deeds</em> is more literally “works” (as in the RSV). This word refers to “good deeds.” It refers to good activities that people do out of love for God or for other people. This same word occurs in 2:14c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the humility that comes from wisdom:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the humility that comes from wisdom</em> is literally “the humility/meekness of wisdom.” This probably means the humility <u>that comes from</u> wisdom (as the BSB translates it). In other words, wisdom is the source from which humility comes.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the gentleness that wisdom brings (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>humility. This <span data-bnType=\"implied\">humility</span> comes from wisdom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">When someone has humility that comes from wisdom, he has both humility and wisdom. So another way to translate this phrase is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>humility and wisdom (GNT)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Translator’s Handbook (page 122) and Exegetical Summary (page 136) both treat “humility and wisdom” (GNT) as a separate interpretation from “humility that comes from wisdom.” However it is not certain whether the GNT (and similar CEV) really interpret the meaning of the genitive differently or have simply chosen to translate it differently.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>humility:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>humility</em> refers to a submissive and teachable attitude. This attitude is expressed by a person being gentle or mild rather than being harsh or ready to fight.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>meekness (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>gentleness (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being mild</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note on 1:21c “humbly” which translates the same phrase in Greek.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>wisdom:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>wisdom</em> here refers to the ability to know and choose what is right. Use an expression that corresponds to the one you have chosen for “wise&quot; in 3:13a.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:13a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of some of the clauses in 3:13a–c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>You who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">claim to</span> be wise and to perceive things well <sup>13b</sup>need to prove it. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">In order to prove it,</span> you should behave well. <sup>13c</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is,</span> you should do good without boasting about it.

First, in 3:13 James introduced the topic of wisdom. Then he continued with two paragraphs. In each paragraph he discussed one type of wisdom. The first type he discussed (in 3:14–16) is the false wisdom that does not come from God. The second type he discussed (in 3:17–18) is the true wisdom that does come from God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>True Wisdom Comes from God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Two Kinds of Wisdom (NIV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060003014\" data-endVerseId=\"1060003016\"><h3>Paragraph 3:14–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:14–16, James discussed false wisdom. People who have envy and personal ambition show that the wisdom that they claim to have is false. It does not come from God.</p></div><h4>3:14a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you harbor bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts:</strong> This clause begins with the word <em>if.</em> But James was assuming that some of his readers did have bitter envy and selfish ambition. In some languages, it may be best not to translate this as an “if” sentence. It may be better to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Some of you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">From the context, it seems that James was still addressing men who wanted to be recognized as teachers in the church. No doubt there was more than one teacher, and they were competing with one another. Every teacher and his supporters thought that their way was correct. They were dedicated to their way so much that they argued bitterly and fiercely with their opponents.</p><h4>3:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if you harbor bitter jealousy</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But if you<sup>(plur)</sup> have a lot of envy</p></li><li><p>¶ But some of you<sup>(plur)</sup> are extremely jealous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of other people</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> introduces a contrast with 3:13c. The “bitter envy and selfish ambition” that James saw in people are in contrast to the “humility” (3:13c) that he wanted to see.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you harbor:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>harbor</em> is literally “have” (as in the RSV). Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you have (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bitter jealousy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>bitter</em> is often used to describe water that is not drinkable because of its bad taste (as it was used in 3:11). It is used figuratively here to refer to an attitude that is harsh, unpleasant, and resentful.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>jealousy</em> also means “envy.” It is intense, negative feelings when someone else succeeds in ways that you have not succeeded.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bitter envy (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>severe envy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>very jealous</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>extremely unhappy when others succeed</p></blockquote><h4>3:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and selfish ambition in your hearts,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and selfishness in your<sup>(plur)</sup> hearts,</p></li><li><p>and selfish.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and selfish ambition:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>selfish ambition</em> can also be translated as “selfishness” (as in the NET). It refers to the attitude of someone who works to advance his own interests even if it harms or offends others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>self-centered ambition (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>selfishness (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and you want only you yourself to be dominant</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and you only think about yourself</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>want to succeed more than others are succeeding</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, James seems to have been warning teachers not to seek to increase the number of people in the church who supported them. He was also warning their groups of supporters not to promote their own teacher and try to destroy the reputation of the other teachers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This same word occurs in Philippians 2:3–4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in your hearts:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hearts</em> refers to the part of a person where his thoughts and feelings come from. Some languages refer to this part of a person as the liver or stomach. In other languages, it may be most natural to omit this phrase altogether and leave the meaning implicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>if you are bitterly jealous and selfish</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you may translate it in another way that refers to someone’s inward thoughts and attitudes. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness <u>inside yourself</u></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if you are bitterly jealous and <u>filled with</u> self-centered ambition (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>3:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>do not boast in it</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>do not boast of your wisdom.

Most scholars agree that the boast is a claim to be wise. You may want to make this clear in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not boast of your wisdom (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>don’t brag about being wise (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boast:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>boast</em> here means to brag or say good things about oneself. James was telling his readers not to make confident or arrogant claims that they were wise.</p><h4>3:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or deny the truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not lie<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like that</span>.</p></li><li><p>It’s not true.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or deny the truth:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>deny the truth</em> is literally “do not lie against the truth.” There are several ways to interpret this clause. The two most common ways are:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a third view: the truth which is contradicted is the truth that true wisdom is accompanied by meekness. When someone claims to be wise but is full of selfishness and jealousy, his life contradicts this truth. (See Martin, pages 130–131; Moo (2000), page 172; Laws, page 160–161.)</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word <em>truth</em> refers to the truth regarding <u>the boast that they are wise</u>. According to this interpretation, those who boasted that they were wise were not telling the truth. They were lying.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Huther, page 167; Mayor, page 123; Mitton, page 137; Davids (1982), page 151.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14c</sup>Don’t say that you are wise <sup>14d</sup>when it isn’t true. (GW) <em>(GW, NLT96; possibly REB, NLT, CEV, NCV<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>These last four versions which speak about hiding, covering up, or defying the truth may mean “do not cover up the truth that you are really full of jealousy and selfish ambition and so cannot have true wisdom.”</span></span>)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word <em>truth</em> refers to the truth that is <u>found in the gospel or God’s word</u>. (Or it may refer more specifically to the truth about what wisdom really is like.) According to this interpretation, those who boasted that they were wise “denied, contradicted, or hid from others” the truth of the gospel by the way they lived. They prevented or hindered people from knowing what real truth was.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English translations are ambiguous, and it is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is a lie.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not lie like that.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are lying.

First, in 3:13 James introduced the topic of wisdom. Then he continued with two paragraphs. In each paragraph he discussed one type of wisdom. The first type he discussed (in 3:14–16) is the false wisdom that does not come from God. The second type he discussed (in 3:17–18) is the true wisdom that does come from God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>True Wisdom Comes from God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Two Kinds of Wisdom (NIV)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060003017\" data-endVerseId=\"1060003018\"><h3>Paragraph 3:17–18</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">This paragraph discusses true wisdom. This wisdom is from God.</p></div><h4>3:17</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse, James used seven Greek terms to describe true wisdom. The number of words that you need in your language to translate these seven terms is not the important matter. In some languages, it may be natural to translate these seven Greek terms with fewer than seven terms. In other languages, more than seven terms may be needed. For example, the CEV uses eight terms:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But the wisdom that comes from above leads us to be pure, friendly, gentle, sensible, kind, helpful, genuine, and sincere.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You should use the number of terms necessary in your language to cover the same area of meaning that the Greek does with its seven terms.</p><h4>3:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But the wisdom from above is first of all pure,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But the wisdom that is from heaven/above is firstly pure.</p></li><li><p>¶ But the people whom God makes wise are most importantly pure/clean.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> introduces a contrast. The contrast is between earthly wisdom (in 3:15) and heavenly wisdom (here in 3:17).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the wisdom from above:</strong> The term “from above” refers to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wisdom that comes from God (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">(This same term also occurs in 3:15a.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause contains a figure of speech called personification. In this personification, James speaks of wisdom as if it were a person who is pure, peace-loving, considerate, and so on.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the personification. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wisdom from above (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wisdom that comes from above (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the wisdom that God gives</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the person whose wisdom comes from God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the person whom God makes wise</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is first of all pure:</strong> The phrase <em>first of all</em> means “most importantly.” James listed seven Greek terms to describe wisdom. Being pure is the most important one.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is firstly pure</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is most importantly pure</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the most important term in a list occurs last. If this is the case in your language, you should put your word for “pure” at the end of the list.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pure:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pure</em> means “free from faults,” and “morally undefiled.” If a person is pure, he is not contaminated by any desires that do not come from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>faultless</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without sinful desires</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>only desires to please God</p></blockquote><h4>3:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>then peace-loving,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is</span> also peaceful,</p></li><li><p>They do not cause quarrels/fights,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>peace-loving:</strong> A <em>peace-loving</em> person is someone who has peaceful relationships with other people.

A person with this quality considers the feelings and needs of others. This word often describes a leader (king or judge) who is considerate/merciful in dealing with people rather than being strict and severe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>considerate (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>considers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the opinions/needs of</span> others</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>respectful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to others</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>not harsh toward people</p></blockquote><h4>3:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>accommodating,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> obedient,</p></li><li><p>they are not stubborn/obstinate,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>accommodating:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>accommodating</em> refers to someone who is:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>open to listen to and be persuaded by the good reasons and ideas of others</p></li><li><p>obedient and submissive</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Such a person is not stubborn.

It is not just feeling sympathetic but includes doing deeds that express love and concern for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely merciful</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has pity/mercy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>always ready to help those who are troubled (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the note on <em>mercy</em> at 2:13a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>full of…good fruit:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>full of…good fruit</em> describes a person who does many good, kind actions. The word <em>fruit</em> refers to the actions that wisdom produces.

It also contains a metaphor. There are at least two main issues to consider as you translate this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1: How to translate naturally</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This Greek sentence is more literally “the fruit/harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by the ones making peace.” It may be strange to speak of a harvest being sown. So it may be more natural to speak of sowing seeds that result in a harvest. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2: How to translate the metaphor</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>sow</em> and <em>raise a harvest</em> are a metaphor. James compared the activity of sowing (seeds) and harvesting a crop to the activity of a peacemaker. These activities are similar in that certain actions naturally lead to certain results. Just as planting a crop leads to a harvest, promoting peace among the community of believers leads to righteous actions in that community.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When peacemakers plant seeds of peace, they will harvest justice. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of goodness. (NLT96)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Peacemakers are like people who plant and then harvest a crop. When they make/promote peace, it results in righteous actions.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When people live peacefully and help others to be at peace, then the result is righteous actions in their lives and the lives of others.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Peacemakers who sow in peace</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When peacemakers plant seeds of peace, (CEV)</p></li><li><p>Peacemakers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are like people</span> who sow</p></li><li><p>When people live in peace and work for peace,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Peacemakers who sow in peace:</strong> The phrase <em>who sow in peace</em> describes all peacemakers. It does not indicate that some peacemakers sow in peace and others do not.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to make this clear are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When people who are peacemakers sow in peace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Peacemakers, <u>because</u> they sow in peace</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Peacemakers:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Peacemakers</em> is literally “those who make peace” (as in the RSV). It refers to people who:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>live in peace with other people, and</p></li><li><p>help others to stop quarreling and live together peacefully.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People who live peacefully and who help others to live together peacefully</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People who live in peace and who help others stop quarreling</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Those who are peaceful and who settle conflicts</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who sow in peace:</strong> The way you translate the phrase <em>in peace</em> will depend on whether you keep the metaphor or translate the meaning. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If you keep the metaphor, the word <em>peace</em> here refers to that which is sown. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The peace sown by peacemakers (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When peacemakers plant seeds of peace (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>If you translate the meaning, the phrase <em>in peace</em> refers to the manner or attitude in which peacemakers act. In other words, peacemakers do things in a manner or attitude that leads to peace between people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When people live peacefully and help others to be at peace</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When people behave in a peaceable way</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>3:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>reap the fruit of righteousness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they harvest righteousness/goodness.</p></li><li><p>and then harvest <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a crop</span>.

Some versions, like the BSB, translate it as a verb phrase. (Some other examples are below.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>the fruit of righteousness</em> means “a harvest that consists of righteousness.” Right living that pleases God is the fruit or crop that is produced by wise people who sow peace.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The way you translate this phrase will depend on whether you keep the metaphor or translate the meaning. For example:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>If you keep the metaphor, you will translate the word <em>harvest</em> literally.

(NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The conflicts and quarrels come from inside people. So in some languages, it is more natural to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>What causes…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Why do you fight and argue with each other? (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>conflicts and quarrels:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>conflicts</em> and <em>quarrels</em> refer to serious conflicts. These words can refer to both physical fighting and verbal arguments.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fights and arguments (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>conflicts and disputes (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice the plural forms. This shows that these conflicts were happening frequently. James was not thinking of just one problem.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be more natural to translate these nouns as verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> fight and quarrel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so often</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>conflicts</em> and <em>quarrels</em> are a doublet. This means that these two words mean almost the same thing. In some languages, both words can be translated by one word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Where do your <span data-bnType=\"implied\">frequent</span> conflicts come from?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>among you:</strong> The phrase <em>among you</em> indicates that James was talking about quarrels and disputes among Christian people.</p><h4>4:1b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Don’t they come from the passions at war within you?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It is a response to the rhetorical question in 4:1a. James used this rhetorical question to emphasize that the fights and quarrels came from people’s evil desires.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t they come from the evil desires at war within you? (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They come from your<sup>(plur)</sup> desires that battle within you, right?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They come from the selfish desires that war within you. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this emphasis in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">James was not informing his readers of something they did not know. He was reminding them of something they already knew.</p><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Don’t they come from the passions</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They come from your<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">selfish</span> desires</p></li><li><p>Your<sup>(plur)</sup> own <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil/selfish</span> desires cause these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">situations</span>.</p></li><li><p>It is because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each of</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> desires/wants many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">different</span> things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for only yourselves</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they:</strong> The pronoun <em>they</em> refers to the “fights and quarrels” in 4:1a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>come from:</strong> Use a verb that corresponds with the verb in 4:1a. For example, if you used the verb “come from” in 4:1a, you can use <em>come from</em> here. If you used the verb “causes” in 4:1a, you may want to use “caused” here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Aren’t they caused by…? (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the passions:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>passions</em> here refers to wrong, selfish desires. These <em>passions</em> are desires for personal wealth, glory, and pleasure.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Mitton, page 146. See also Alford, page 311.</span></span> James was perhaps particularly thinking of the desire of some people to be powerful and popular and to have authority.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Martin, page 145. Huther, page 174, thinks of the pursuit of earthly riches in particular. The Greek word <em>ἡδονή</em> can in some contexts refer to the pursuit of physical and sensual pleasures, but the context in James does not support that reference.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>selfish desires (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>desires for pleasure (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to translate the phrase <em>the passions</em> with a clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">selfishly</span> desire to have</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> really want</p></blockquote><h4>4:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>at war within you?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that are fighting inside you<sup>(plur)</sup>, right?</p></li><li><p>They are struggling inside your<sup>(plur)</sup> hearts/spirits <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against what you should want</span>.</p></li><li><p>that are opposite/contrary to the good that you<sup>(plur)</sup> should want.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at war within you:</strong> The clause <em>at war within you</em> refers to your desires “which are constantly fighting within you.” (GNT)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is a figure of speech called personification. The word “passions” in 4:1b is the subject of the word <em>war</em>. It is as if the “passions” were people who could fight.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this personification:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that fight to control you (GW)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the figure.

There are basically three interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The desires in a person are fighting a war against his conscience or his soul. The struggle is inside him.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) is supported by Mayor, page 129; Adamson (1976), page 166; Hiebert, page 244; Davids (1982), page 157; Moo (1985), page 139.</span></span></p></li><li><p>The desires in a person are fighting a war against other people as he tries to do what pleases God and not what pleases them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (2) is supported by Alford, page 312; Huther, page 127; Ropes, page 253; Martin, page 140.</span></span></p></li><li><p>The different desires in a person are fighting a war with each other inside the person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (3) is supported by JBP and by Laws, page 168.</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">English versions do not say whom the desires are fighting.

He introduced this topic by means of a rhetorical question (4:1a). He then responded to his question, using another rhetorical question (4:1b). Christians quarrel because they selfishly desire things. In 4:2–3 he explained the answer in more detail.</p></div><h4>4:2a–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars disagree over how to punctuate this verse. The problem centers on how the word “kill/murder” is connected to the rest of the verse. The two interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The verb “kill/murder” is primarily connected to what comes <u>before</u> it. So it should be separated from what follows by strong punctuation, such as a full stop.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ropes, page 254; Mitton, page 147; Laws, page 169; Hiebert, page 245; Moo (1985), page 140. Mayor, page 130–131, would accept this, but he prefers to emend (i.e., reconstruct) the text. See also Blass-Debrunner-Funk, <em>A Greek Grammar of the NT,</em> §494, and the margin of Westcott &amp; Hort’s Greek text.</span></span> For example, the ESV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. <em>(NIV11, RSV, GNT, REB, CEV, NASB, NJB, GW, NLT, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The verb “kill/murder” is primarily related to what comes <u>after</u> it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, page 312; Huther, page 176; Adamson (1976), page 167–168; Davids (1982), page 158; Martin, page 140–141. It is also the punctuation of Westcott &amp; Hort in the text, and of the UBS Greek New Testament.</span></span> So there should be punctuation separating it from what comes before it. For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You desire and you do not have; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain; you quarrel and fight. <em>(BSB, NIV84, NET, NCV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the interpretation that the majority of English versions follow.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">See the General Comment on 4:2a–f at the end of 4:2f for examples of how this verse can be reordered.</p><h4>4:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You crave</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You want something (NIV)</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> want/desire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You crave:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>You crave</em> is literally “You want/desire.” James did not say what his readers wanted or desired. In some languages, it may be more natural to supply an object, as the BSB has done. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You want <u>something</u> (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You want <u>things</u> (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You want <u>what</u> you don’t have (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>what you do not have;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but don’t get it (NIV)</p></li><li><p>but you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not have them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what you do not have:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>what</em> here introduces a contrast that many versions translate as “but.” The contrast is between what people want and what they actually have. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you want something <u>but</u> don’t get it (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you do not have:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates literally as <em>you do not have</em> indicates that the believers were not receiving the thing or things that they wanted.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verb are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>don’t have (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you do not have them (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you kill</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so you<sup>(plur)</sup> murder.</p></li><li><p>so you<sup>(plur)</sup> are ready to kill. (GNT)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you kill:</strong> The clause <em>you kill</em> is a result of not having what you want. In some languages, it is more natural to make the relation between 4:2b and 4:2c clear by supplying a conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2a</sup>You want <sup>2b</sup>what you don’t have, <sup>2c</sup><u>so</u> you commit murder. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kill:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>kill</em> normally means “murder” (as in 2:11a–b). Here it is probably a hyperbole. James used this word to startle his readers. He warned them that if they were not careful, their bad desires would soon lead to actual murder.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ropes, page 255; Laws, page 172.</span></span> It is unlikely that James’ readers were actually killing one another. If they had been killing one another, he would have written more to criticize them even more harshly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this word are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate it literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you murder (ESV) <em>If you translate it literally, it may be good to add a footnote saying that this is an exaggeration.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate it in a way that shows that cases of murder had not actually occurred. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are ready to kill (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>4:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and covet,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> strongly desire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that someone else has</span>,</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> are envious <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the things of others</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>covet:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>covet</em> means “desire to possess something that someone else has.” This could be a material possession (like a big house) or a special honor or position of authority.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some translations understand the Greek verb here to mean “to envy, be jealous of [someone]” (NASB, REB, NLT, NET). This is also a valid possibility, but it does not fit so well with the next verb, “you cannot have,” which implies the object is a thing, not a person.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> want what someone else has</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you strongly desire things (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are jealous of what others have (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but are unable to obtain it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but you<sup>(plur)</sup> are not able to obtain <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span>.</p></li><li><p>but you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not succeed in getting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these things</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but are unable to obtain it:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>are unable to obtain it</em> is more literally “you are not able to obtain.” This clause indicates that the believers were unable to get the thing or things that they were coveting. As in 4:2b, it may be natural to supply an object. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>cannot obtain <u>it</u> (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you cannot get <u>them</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> are not able to get <u>what you want</u></p></blockquote><h4>4:2f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You quarrel and fight.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> argue and fight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with one another</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> fight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with each other</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You quarrel and fight:</strong> The clause <em>You quarrel and fight</em> is the result of not obtaining what you want. In some languages, it is more natural to make this relationship between 4:2e and 4:2f clear by supplying a conjunction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2e</sup>but you cannot get them, <sup>2f</sup><u>so</u> you quarrel and fight (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>quarrel and fight:</strong> The verbs <em>quarrel and fight</em> are related to the nouns “fights and quarrels” in 4:1a. So the translations of them should correspond if possible. Try to use words that can include both verbal disputes and physical fighting.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate these verbs is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>argue and fight (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The verbs <em>quarrel</em> and <em>fight</em> are a doublet. This means that these two words mean almost the same thing. In some languages, the two verbs can be translated by a single verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>2e</sup>you cannot have what you want, <sup>2f</sup>so you fight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with each other</span>.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:2a–f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 4:2a–f is made up of two sentences. Each sentence tells what the people want and how they react when they do not get what they want. In some languages, it is more natural to first tell how people react and then the reason that they react that way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2c</sup>You kill each other <sup>2b</sup>because you do not have <sup>2a</sup>what you crave. <sup>2f</sup>You quarrel and fight each other <sup>2e</sup>because you are unable to obtain <sup>2d</sup>what you covet.</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:2g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You do not have,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> do not have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what you want</span>,</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> do not have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the things you want</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You do not have:</strong> Here James left some words implicit. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply this implicit information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You don’t have <u>the things you want</u> (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You do not have <u>what you want</u> (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:2h</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2h\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because you do not ask.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not ask God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for it</span>.</p></li><li><p>because you<sup>(plur)</sup> don’t pray for them. (GW)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> introduces the reason that people do not get what they desire.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you do not ask:</strong> Although the BSB translates this clause literally, many English versions supply the word <em>God</em> to make clear whom the people did not ask.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause refers to praying to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because you don’t pray for them. (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:2g–h</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Verse 4:2g–h gives the reason that people do not get what they want. In some languages, it is more natural to change the order of these clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2h</sup>You do not ask God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for what you want</span>, <sup>2g</sup>so/therefore you do not have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what you want</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">This is a general statement about a situation that frequently happened. It does not mean, however, that James’ readers never asked God for things. This is made clear in 2:3.</p></div>",

(CEV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You adulteresses!:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The KJV translation “Ye adulterers and adulteresses” follows a different Greek text, but the meaning is also metaphorical.</span></span> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>You adulteresses</em> is literally “adulteresses.” This word is feminine and often refers to women who are unfaithful to their husbands. Here this word is a metaphor. In this metaphor, James was rebuking some of his readers by comparing them (both men and women) to women who had committed adultery.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way that they are similar is that they were not loyal.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some of James’ readers had not been loyal to God. They had promised that they would follow God, just as a bride promises to stay with her husband. But they had been unfaithful to him like adulterous women are unfaithful to their husbands. So James rebuked them by calling them adulteresses. (This same word is also used metaphorically in Matthew 12:39 and Mark 8:38.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to translate this figure of speech here:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Adulterers! (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are adulterous people!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are like unfaithful wives (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You are like married women who are immoral</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You unfaithful people! (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are not loyal to God! (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Make sure your translation is acceptable for public reading in church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some translations, it may be helpful to include a footnote to further explain the metaphor of adulteresses. An example for such a footnote is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The word “adulteresses” here comes from a common Old Testament metaphor that describes God as the husband and his people as his wife. When God’s people were unfaithful to him by worshipping idols, they are described as “adulteresses” and “prostitutes.” See Jeremiah chapter 3; 13:27 and Isaiah 54:5–7; 57:3.</p></blockquote><h4>4:4b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. James used this rhetorical question to express emphasis.

Another way to translate this conjunction is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whoever chooses:</strong> The phrase <em>whoever chooses</em> can also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whoever chooses</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the person who chooses</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase does not refer to any person in particular.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, a plural subject may be more appropriate than a singular.

James used this rhetorical question to emphasize that his readers <u>should not think</u> that the Scripture says things without reason. In this rhetorical question, James used scripture to support his statement in 4:4. That statement is that friendship with the world cannot exist together with friendship with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this emphasis are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”?

It implies that the following sentence will support James’ statement in 4:4. Here this word is not used to indicate a choice between two options. It is perhaps for that reason that some English versions omit this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do you think:</strong> The clause <em>do you think</em> introduces a rhetorical question. It implies that the reader should not think that way. One way to translate this clause is to make the entire sentence a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you should certainly not think</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider what form of question or statement will translate this naturally in your language.</p><h4>4:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the Scripture says without reason</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God’s word/message has no purpose when it says</p></li><li><p>what God says in his book means nothing when he says</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Scripture says:</strong> In the clause <em>the Scripture says,</em> the word <em>Scripture</em> is personified. This means that <em>Scripture</em> is spoken of as if it were a person that says things. In some languages, it may be necessary to say that it is God who says these things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in</span> Scripture, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> says</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God said in his book</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is written in God’s word</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Usually in the New Testament, the words <em>the Scripture says</em> introduce a direct quote from the Old Testament. But here, the sentence that these words introduce does not match any Old Testament sentence very closely. Many commentators<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, page 314; Mayor, page 136; Mitton, page 154; Moo (1985), page 146; Martin, page 149.</span></span> suggest that 4:5c is a <u>summary</u> of Old Testament teaching.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alternatively, some commentators (Laws, page 174; Hiebert, page 254) and versions (Revised Version (1881): “Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit…?” and JBP: “Or do you think what the Scriptures have to say about this is a mere formality? Do you imagine that this spirit…?”) take the verse as two separate sentences. In this case the words “the scripture” might refer back to 3:4 or forward to the rest of 3:5.However, it is more natural to take the Greek words translated <em>Scripture says</em> as simply introducing what Scripture says. For this reason punctuating as one sentence, as in BSB, is recommended.</span></span> They say that it is not a quotation of the exact words of a verse in the Old Testament.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are similar cases in John 7:38 and John 7:42.</span></span> Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>scripture teaches</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in scripture God teaches</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>Scripture</em> also occurs in 2:8b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without reason:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>without reason</em> means “for no purpose” or “in vain.” James used this word to indicate that the words of Scripture that follow are not useless or worthless words. They are true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in vain (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for nothing (NRSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to no purpose (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>no truth (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that the Spirit He caused to dwell in us yearns with envy?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that he jealously desires the spirit that he gave us?<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li><li><p>God created our<sup>(incl)</sup> spirit. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So,</span> he strongly desires us<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to only love/worship him</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a jealous husband wants his wife to love only him</span>.</p></li><li><p>God put a soul into man <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give him life</span>.

In Greek, it is unclear whether:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>the spirit</em> refers to the human spirit or the Holy Spirit</p></li><li><p><em>the spirit</em> is the subject or the object of the verb that the BSB translates as <em>yearns with envy</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The main ways to interpret the phrase <em>the Spirit</em> are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the <u>human spirit</u> and is the <u>object</u> of the verb. According to this interpretation, God has strong feelings of jealousy for us. God will not tolerate his people loving the world. He wants their total loyalty. <em>According to this interpretation, this verse is connected with 4:4. It is a metaphor of God as the jealous husband who has an adulterous wife.

It means “Develop a close relationship with God.” It does not mean that we should change our physical location.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider how you speak of being in a good relationship with someone. If your readers will not understand the spiritual sense of <em>Draw near,</em> you will have to adjust how you express this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In your hearts</span> come/go near to God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Know God better</p></blockquote><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and He will draw near to you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then</span> he will come close to you.<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li><li><p>and he will cause you<sup>(plur)</sup> to understand him better.</p></li><li><p>and he will reward/help you.<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and He will draw near to you:</strong> The verb <em>draw near</em> is the same verb as in 4:8a. Some languages will use the same verb in both 4:8a and 4:8b. But other languages will use different verbs for “people <u>going</u> near to God” and “God <u>coming</u> near to them.” In any case, this does not mean that God actually changes his physical location. The verbs in 4:8a and 4:8b refer to our spiritual relationship with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you made an adjustment to your translation of “Draw near” in 4:8a, you will also have to make an adjustment here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he will reward/help you</p></blockquote><h4>4:8c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded:</strong> This sentence has a grammatical structure called a parallelism. In this parallelism, 4:8c and 4:8d are poetic ways to say the same thing. The similar parts are underlined in the same way:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>c</sup> <u>Cleanse your hands</u>, <u>you sinners</u>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>d</sup>and <u>purify your hearts</u>, <u>you double-minded</u></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>Cleanse your hands</em> is similar in meaning to <em>purify your hearts.</em> The phrases <em>you sinners</em> and <em>you double-minded</em> are two ways to talk about the same group of people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See the General Comment at the end of 4:8d to see examples of how to combine 4:8c–d.</p><h4>4:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Cleanse your hands, you sinners,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Wash <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sin off</span> your hands, you<sup>(plur)</sup> sinners,</p></li><li><p>You sinners, clean sin out of your lives.

It is not a literal command to get some water and use it to clean their hands.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this phrase:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cleanse your hands (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a figure of speech.

(CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>clean sin out of your lives (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Whichever way you translate this phrase, it is good to put the other option in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you sinners:</strong> The phrase <em>you sinners</em> functions as a strong rebuke. It also strengthens James’ command about washing hands.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are sinners!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Realize that you have sinned. (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because you are sinners</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and stop sinning</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the BSB places the phrase <em>you sinners</em> at the end of 4:8c. This follows the word order in the Greek text. In some languages, it is more natural to place it at the beginning of 4:8c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sinners:</strong> The word <em>sinners</em> refers to people who habitually offend God by doing what is contrary to his law. The ways people may offend God include doing and thinking things that God does not approve. People may also offend God by their attitudes and by not doing what God wants them to do. Some ways to translate <em>sinners</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who sin</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who do not obey God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wrongdoers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\">See also the note on “sin” at 1:15b.</p><h4>4:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and clean <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sin from</span> your hearts, you<sup>(plur)</sup> who want to go two ways at once.</p></li><li><p>You who are trying to follow God and the world at the same time, make your thinking pure. (NCV)</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who have</span> minds/hearts <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that are</span> divided <span data-bnType=\"implied\">between pleasing God and pleasing yourselves</span>, remove sin from there.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>purify your hearts:</strong> The phrase <em>purify your hearts</em> is a metaphor. In this metaphor, removing sin from our lives is compared to purifying our hearts. The way that the two actions are similar is that something bad is removed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In both Hebrew and Greek, the <em>heart</em> refers to a person’s thoughts and desires. So to <em>purify</em> one’s <em>heart</em> means to remove evil thoughts and desires.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make your hearts pure (NET) <em>In some cultures, an organ other than the heart may be used to describe the part of the person where thoughts and desires come from. For example:</em></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Make your liver pure/good</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make your thinking pure (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you double-minded:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>double-minded</em> functions as a strong rebuke. It refers to people who seem to have two minds or hearts that are fighting each other. One mind wants to please God. The other mind wants to please the world, and so it is fighting God. If your language has an idiom for this term, consider using it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you people who can’t make up your mind (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You who are trying to follow God and the world at the same time (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because you are thinking two ways</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and stop trying to follow both sin and God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the BSB places the phrase <em>you double-minded</em> at the end of 4:8d. This follows the word order in the Greek text. In some languages, it is more natural to place it at the beginning of 4:8d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This same word occurs in 1:8a.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:8c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The parallel parts of 4:8c and 4:8d should be understood as repeating the same thought. So <em>you sinners</em> and <em>you double-minded</em> should not be understood as separate categories of people. If a parallel structure in your language wrongly implies different groups, you may need to combine the parallel parts in these lines. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> sinful people who are thinking two ways, clean your hands and your hearts.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You people who want to please both the world and God, remove evil thoughts and evil actions from your lives.</p></blockquote></div>",

James used these three verbs to emphasize to his readers that they should be very sad because of their sin. In some languages, it is more natural to show this emphasis with one or two verbs plus an intensifier. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Really be sad and cry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">over your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sins</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be very sorry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have sinned</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grieve:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Grieve</em> refers to expressing inner sorrow. James wanted his readers to be sorry and sad because of their sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be sorrowful (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be sad (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mourn:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mourn</em> refers to a severe form of grief or sadness that results in crying. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cry (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be sorry</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>weep:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>weep</em> means to cry. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wail (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>cry (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>4:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Turn your laughter to mourning,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead of laughing, you<sup>(plur)</sup> should start mourning/crying,</p></li><li><p>Stop laughing and start crying.

Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Replace your laughter with crying</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Let your laughter become crying</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to translate both <em>laughter</em> and <em>mourning</em> as verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Stop laughing and start crying. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mourning:</strong> The word <em>mourning</em> is the same Greek word that is translated as “mourn” in 4:9a.</p><h4>4:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and your joy to gloom.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and instead of being joyful/cheerful, you<sup>(plur)</sup> should be sad.</p></li><li><p>Stop being happy, and start being sorry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sins</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and your joy to gloom:</strong> Here James left a word implicit. In some languages, it may be necessary to supply this implicit information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">change</span> your joy to gloom</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This clause is parallel to the one in 4:9b. That one referred to the noises that people make (“laughter”, “mourning”). This clause seems to refer to the expressions on their faces. Another way to translate this clause is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and your joy into sadness (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be more natural to translate <em>joy</em> and <em>gloom</em> as verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Be gloomy instead of glad. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>joy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>joy</em> refers to a state of being cheerful and happy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gloom:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gloom</em> means sadness (as in the NCV). Your language may have an idiom describing someone who goes around with a gloomy, sad face.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:9a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:9a–c, James tells his readers three times that they should mourn because of their sin.

Become deeply sorry and cry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you have sinned</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

If someone criticizes his fellow believer, he is not loving him. So he is not doing what the law demands. When someone does not do what the law says, he communicates by his actions that the law is not worthy of his respect and obedience. So it is as if he is speaking against the law. You may want to make this clear in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is as if</span> he speaks evil of the law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the law:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the law</em> refers to God’s law. In other words, it refers to everything that God has commanded his people to do in their lives.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s Law (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s teachings (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s rules</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word also occurs in 1:25a.</p><h4>4:11e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:11e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and judges it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and accuses it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of being wrong</span>.</p></li><li><p>and condemning them.</p></li><li><p>and says that it is not good, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because he has not kept the Scripture that says, “Love your</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">neighbor as yourself.”</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>judges it:</strong> The phrase <em>judges it</em> indicates that whenever you judge a brother, it is as if you are judging the law. This means that you are “finding fault” with certain laws and are deciding that you do not have to obey them.

For example:</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><sup>11b</sup>Anyone who speaks against his brother <sup>11c</sup>or judges him <sup>11d</sup>speaks against the law <sup>11e</sup>and judges it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because he has not kept the Scripture that says, “Love your neighbor as yourself.”</span></p></div><h4>4:11f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:11f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And if you judge the law,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And when you<sup>(sing)</sup> accuse the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of being wrong</span>,</p></li><li><p>If you<sup>(sing)</sup> condemn the law,</p></li><li><p>When you<sup>(sing)</sup> do that,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> In Greek, this sentence has a conjunction that commonly indicates a change or contrast. Here James uses it to introduce a further stage in his discussion. One way to translate this conjunction is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to use a conjunction here. In other languages, no conjunction is necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you judge the law:</strong> In this verse and the following verse, the pronoun <em>you</em> is singular. By using the singular form, James addresses every person individually, and therefore very forcefully. Consider whether in your language a command spoken to every individual should be in the singular or plural form.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See also judge, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>4:11g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:11g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you are not a practitioner of the law,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> are not a doer of the law,</p></li><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> are not following it,</p></li><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> are not obeying the law.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are not a practitioner of the law:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>you are not a practitioner of the law</em> literally says “you are not a doer of the law” (as in the RSV).

A “judge of the law” is someone who has authority over the law. He decides which part of the law is worthy or necessary to obey and which part is not necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>become a judge over it (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but you are condemning it <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if you were its judge</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but you are acting as if you have the right to say/choose which laws should be obeyed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also judge, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:11f–h</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is more natural to translate the three clauses of 4:11f–h as two clauses.

The BSB and NIV add the word <em>only</em> to make the meaning clearer in English.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text does not say explicitly who the <em>Lawgiver and Judge</em> is. But to James’ readers, it was obvious from the rest of the sentence that it is God. In some languages, it may be necessary to mention God explicitly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is the only lawgiver and judge. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lawgiver:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lawgiver</em> is a noun. In some languages, it is more natural to translate the word <em>Lawgiver</em> as a clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the giver of the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who gave the law</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It may also be more natural to use a verb other than “give.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the one who made the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God who wrote/commanded laws</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is where the law came from</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Judge:</strong> Here the word <em>Judge</em> refers to God. He is the ultimate judge. He is the only one who has authority over the law and can be its judge. He is the only one who has authority to judge people concerning their eternal destiny (4:12b). This contrasts with humans, who do not have authority to judge the law, nor to decide the eternal destiny of people. In some languages, it may be good to make this contrast explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> Judge</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">ultimate</span> Judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the law and people</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to translate the noun <em>Judge</em> as a clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>one who can judge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all things</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See judge, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><h4>4:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the One who is able to save</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is he who is able to save <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span></p></li><li><p>He is the one who can rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternally</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the One who is able to save:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to save</em> means “to rescue from danger or trouble”. In this context, it refers to God rescuing people from eternal death and punishment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to free <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from punishment</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to rescue <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>save <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from eternal death</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word also occurs in 1:21d and 2:14d.

It does not refer to an end of existence. Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to punish <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span> eternally</p></blockquote><h4>4:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But who are you to judge your neighbor?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Who do you<sup>(sing)</sup> think you are that you can accuse/condemn another person?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So,</span> why do you<sup>(sing)</sup> criticize and judge your fellow person?</p></li><li><p>So it is not right for you to judge your neighbor. (NCV)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But who are you to judge your neighbor?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. It expresses a rebuke. James used this rhetorical question to rebuke those who were judging their neighbors. He has just stated in 4:12a–c that judging is God’s work. This rhetorical question implies, “You have no right to do that!”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this rebuke are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who do you think you are, to judge someone else? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why do you<sup>(sing)</sup> judge your neighbor?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you now think that you are that type of person that has power to judge his fellow person?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So it is not right for you to judge your neighbor. (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this rebuke in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>But who are you:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>But</em> indicates a contrast. The contrast is between the word “One” (in 4:12b), that is, God, and <em>you.</em> James emphasized the pronoun <em>you</em> by making it the first word of this sentence and the NIV reflects this emphasis by repeating the word <em>you:</em></p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But you—who are you (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Verse 4:12d is also the conclusion to this paragraph. Another way to connect 4:12d to the rest of the verse is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>judge:</strong> The word <em>judge</em> is the same word as in 4:11c. Some ways to translate it are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Follow the advice given at 4:11c:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>condemn</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>harshly/severely accuse your neighbor of doing wrong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>criticize/rebuke your neighbor in a mean/unkind manner <em>See judge, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use your word for the work of a judge:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>judge (verb) <em>See judge, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Combine both options<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Both translation options (with the word “judge” or not) probably preserve part of James’ logic. 1) Using the word “judge” connects with James’ statement that there is only one Judge. God has the authority to judge people; we do not have authority to judge our brother or neighbor. 2) When we judge in the sense of “harshly criticizing” our brother, we fail to keep the command to love our neighbor. We, therefore, judge the law. But there is only one who has authority to judge the law, the one who gave it. We do not have this authority. Therefore, we do not have the right to judge our neighbor.</span></span> above:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>criticize and judge</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your neighbor:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>neighbor</em> includes anyone that you know. It does not just mean someone who lives nearby or someone who belongs to the same language-group.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>someone else (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>anyone (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word neighbor also occurs in 2:8c–d.</p>",

It is not clear whether or not the people whom James was denouncing belonged to the Christian community. It may be that among the Jewish traders of the time there were some who claimed to follow Christ but were not living as they should. On the other hand, there were no doubt many rich traders and merchants outside the church (see the references to “the rich” in 2:6–7), and James’ words would have served as a warning to Christians not to desire to follow their example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t Brag About Your Plans for the Future (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning against Boasting (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060004013\" data-endVerseId=\"1060004017\"><h3>Paragraph 4:13–17</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">James described the way traders made plans to get rich (4:13). Then he explained that those who think like that are ignoring God (4:14). He told them that instead they ought to submit to the Lord’s will (4:15). He reminded them that their behavior was arrogant (4:16) and warned them that God considered it sinful (4:17).</p></div><h4>4:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Come now, you who say,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Listen <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span>, you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who are saying,</p></li><li><p>¶ Those of you<sup>(plur)</sup> who say that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Come now:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates literally as <em>Come now</em> is an idiomatic way of getting people’s attention.

However, as none of the major English versions have followed this punctuation of the text, it is recommended that you punctuate in accordance with the BSB, as in the notes. For support for this punctuation, see Adamson (1976), page 178, and Motyer, page 160.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we will go:</strong> The traders meant that they would leave the place where they were and begin their journey to another place. The GNT translates this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we will travel</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>we:</strong> James imagined traders who were making their plans. But it is uncertain who they may have been talking to. They may been making plans among themselves. Or they may have been telling other people what they planned to do. So for languages that have inclusive and exclusive forms for “we”, probably either could be used here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to this or that city:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>this or that city</em> refers to a city whose name was not important to James. The traders of whom James was speaking would have known the particular city they were going to. So the expression does not mean “some town or other, but we are not sure which one.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators have not expressed themselves clearly and a number of English versions are ambiguous, but see Blass-Debrunner-Funk, §289; Liddell-Scott-Jones, 9th ed. The reference of the Greek <em>hode </em>(which takes the form <em>tēnde </em>in this verse) is to a particular entity.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have an expression to refer to a particular location without mentioning the name. When someone quotes another person’s words or tells a story, he can use this expression in place of a name. He does this when the exact name is not important. In English, the expressions “such and such” or “so and so” can be used for this purpose.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to a certain city (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to such-and-such a city (JBP)</p></blockquote><h4>4:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>spend a year there,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>stay there a year,</p></li><li><p>and live there for a year</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>spend a year there:</strong> The phrase <em>spend a year there</em> means “live in that city for a year”.

He reminded them that their behavior was arrogant (4:16) and warned them that God considered it sinful (4:17).</p></div><h4>4:14a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life?:</strong> There are two ways to punctuate 4:14a–b. Consequently, there are two ways to interpret the clause that the BSB translates as <em>What is your life.</em> They are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a <u>rhetorical question</u> and goes with what <u>follows</u> in 4:14c–e. According to this interpretation, James was emphasizing the shortness of life.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ropes, page 278; Hiebert, page 276; Laws, page 191; Moo (1985), page 155. In addition, some other modern editions of the Greek text (Tischendorf, von Soden, Vogels, Merk, and Bover), versions (KJV, LB, JBP) and commentators (Alford, page 319; Huther, page 194; Mayor, page 145; Adamson (1976), page 179) follow a different manuscript reading where the word <em>γάρ </em>is inserted, thus ensuring that (1) is inevitably followed.</span></span> For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like? <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, REB, KJV, NET, GW, NLT96, NCV, ESV, CEV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is a <u>statement</u> and goes with what <u>precedes</u> in 4:14a. According to this interpretation, James was emphasizing that the traders were ignorant of what their life would be like tomorrow.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Martin, page 158.</span></span> For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You don’t even know what your life tomorrow will be! <em>(GNT, NASB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). This is followed by the majority of commentators and English versions. James’ point is not about what your life will be like tomorrow, but whether you will be alive at all. This is clear from 4:15.</p><h4>4:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You do not even know what will happen tomorrow!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">However,</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not know what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">events</span> will happen/occur tomorrow!</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> do you<sup>(plur)</sup> even know what will happen tomorrow? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Of course not!</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a contrast between 4:13 and 4:14. The contrast is between the rich people’s plans, and the fact that they do not know what will happen the next day. Some ways to show this contrast are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You talk like that,</span> however</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>You do not even know what will happen tomorrow!:</strong> The BSB uses <em>even</em> as a way of communicating the exclamation in English. The NIV tries to show this exclamation and the contrast mentioned above by using the word “Why.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this sentence are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As an exclamation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you do not know what will happen tomorrow! (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have no idea/clue what will happen tomorrow!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a rhetorical question that emphasizes that we do not know what will happen tomorrow. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But do you even know what will happen tomorrow? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Of course not!</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What do you know about tomorrow?

It emphasizes how uncertain life is. James responded to his own rhetorical question in the next sentence.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this rhetorical question are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>As a rhetorical question. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What is your life after all? (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do you know how long you will live?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To what can your life be compared?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Think about your life.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Consider the time you have to live.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a phrase connected to and introducing 4:14c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your life is…. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The time you live is like</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Translate this rhetorical question in a way that is natural in your language.</p><h4>4:14c–e</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Most English versions use no connecting word at the beginning of this sentence. In Greek, there is a connector showing that this sentence explains the reason why life is uncertain. The RSV translates the Greek conjunction as “For.” Use a natural way of connecting this sentence to the question that came before it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes:</strong> This is a metaphor. In this metaphor, James compared a person’s life to a mist. The way that they are similar is that both exist for only a short time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this metaphor are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is nothing more than mist that appears for only a little while before it disappears. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For your life is like the morning fog—it’s here a little while, then it’s gone. (NLT96)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without using the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You live for a brief while and then pass away.</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>4:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You are a mist</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a puff of</span> smoke</p></li><li><p>It is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very brief</span> like steam</p></li><li><p>for only</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You are:</strong> The words <em>You are</em> introduce an answer to the question “What is your life?” In some languages, it may be necessary to say “Your life is….” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your life is like (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a mist:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a mist</em> means “a vapor or smoke that goes into the air.” Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>puff of smoke (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>morning fog (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>steam</p></blockquote><h4>4:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that appears for a little while</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that is here <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> a short time.</p></li><li><p>that is seen for a moment (GW)</p></li><li><p>a brief time.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>appears for a little while:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>appears</em> means “exists” or “is here.” Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it’s here a little while (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that is seen for a moment (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You can see it for a short time (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:14e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and then vanishes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then it disappears.</p></li><li><p>then goes away.</p></li><li><p>Then you<sup>(plur)</sup> die.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and then vanishes:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>vanishes</em> also means “disappear.” Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and then disappears (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>then it goes away (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate the meaning of 4:14c–e without using a metaphor, some ways to translate <em>vanishes</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and then you pass away</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>then it’s over</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and then you die</p></blockquote>",

On the other hand, there were no doubt many rich traders and merchants outside the church (see the references to “the rich” in 2:6–7), and James’ words would have served as a warning to Christians not to desire to follow their example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t Brag About Your Plans for the Future (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Warning against Boasting (GNT)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060004013\" data-endVerseId=\"1060004017\"><h3>Paragraph 4:13–17</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">James described the way traders made plans to get rich (4:13). Then he explained that those who think like that are ignoring God (4:14). He told them that instead they ought to submit to the Lord’s will (4:15). He reminded them that their behavior was arrogant (4:16) and warned them that God considered it sinful (4:17).</p></div><h4>4:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>yet fails to do it,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and does not do it,</p></li><li><p>but does not behave like that,</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:17</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin:</strong> In this sentence, James warned people to behave properly. He stated the warning in general terms, but he was probably warning people against making plans with a boastful attitude (4:13–16). He wanted people to be humble when they made plans for the future.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentators disagree on what James is talking about. There are three interpretations:(1) The verse refers to the topic of making plans with a boastful attitude (4:13–16). In this context doing <em>the good he ought to do</em> means being humble when making plans, as James recommended in 4:15. (Interpretation (1) is followed by Alford, page 319; Adamson (1976), page 181; Hiebert, page 280; Moo (1985), page 158.(2) In <em>the good he ought to do</em> the idea of “doing good” means doing good deeds (see chapter 2). The traders were guilty of trying to make a profit for themselves instead of sharing it with the poor. (Interpretation (2) is followed by Laws, page 193.)(3) The statement does not refer particularly to this paragraph, but to all the teaching that James has given so far. (Interpretation (3) is followed by Mayor, page 147; Mitton, page 172; and apparently by RSV since that version omits the connecting word <em>then.</em>)All three of these interpretations are supported by different commentators. However, three points show that James meant this verse to be understood together with the verses before it (4:13–16), as in interpretation (1).First, the verse has a connecting word in the Greek, translated <em>then.</em> Secondly, the word <em>good</em> is the opposite of the word “evil” in 4:16. Thirdly, if James wanted this statement to apply to all his teaching, he would have put it near the end of chapter 5.Interpretation (1) is recommended because it is the only interpretation in which this verse is understood together with 4:13–16.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore, the person who knows the good thing to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this situation</span>, but he does not do it, he has sinned.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You know what is the right thing to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in this matter</span>.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Terrible things are going to happen to you.

See Mayor, pages 148–149; Hiebert, page 285; Mitton, page 176; Tasker, page 110; Manton, page 403. They point out that there is evidence that the word translated <em>riches</em> originally referred in the ancient world to having plenty of grain stored in the granaries. Also, the word translated <em>rotted</em> usually means actual rotting, although it can mean decay in general. Thirdly, since 5:2a is connected by “and” to a clause that mentions a specific kind of possessions (5:2b), it seems likely that 5:2a also refers to a specific kind of possessions. Note also that Palestine was primarily an agricultural society, and see Luke 12:16–21. However, none of the major English versions translate this word as “grain.”</span></span> or “be ruined.” In 5:2b and 5:3a James went on to mention which possessions in particular had spoiled. Use a word for <em>rotted</em> that goes well with <em>riches.</em> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your riches have decayed (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your richest goods are ruined (JBP)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This future event is so certain that James spoke of it as something that had already happened.

In the biblical world, beautiful garments were very expensive, and people considered them as part of their wealth. (See Judges 14:12; 2 Kings 5:5; Acts 20:33). The larvae of moths could eat the cloth and make holes in it while the garment was stored.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As in 5:2a, this future event is so certain that James spoke of it as something that had already happened.

But the gold and silver that most people have is not 100% pure, so it can rust. In addition, silver can tarnish (become blackened).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rusted (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tarnished/blackened</p></blockquote><h4>5:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Their corrosion will testify against you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and that rust will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a witness against you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the day that God will judge you</span>.</p></li><li><p>and the rust will be evidence against you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you have been greedy/selfish with your wealth</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Their corrosion will testify against you:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>Their corrosion will testify against you</em> is literally “Their corrosion will be a witness to/for you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>their rust will be a witness against you (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This sentence is a figure of speech called personification. In this personification, James speaks of corrosion as if it were a person who will testify in court. James meant that on the day when God will judge all people, the <em>corrosion</em> of the gold and silver will be evidence that rich people had misused their possessions. They misused their possessions by hoarding them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>An alternate understanding of the sense in which the rust “will testify against them” is that the rust is evidence of the temporary and perishable (and therefore worthless) nature of riches. However, if this is the meaning, then the rust is less a condemning testimony in court and more a “teaching witness” that reveals the true nature and value of riches. But this is less in keeping with the context of judgment coming upon them in the last days.</span></span> Rich people had more possessions than they needed, but they did not give them to help others.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the personification.

Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the same corrosion (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>their rust (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that rust (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will be evidence</span></p></blockquote><h4>5:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and consume your flesh like fire.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It will burn your<sup>(plur)</sup> bodies like fire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">burns</span>.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the same rust</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that destroyed your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wealth</span> will destroy you too.

The corrosion will <em>consume your flesh.</em> James connected the idea that their wealth is being destroyed by rust with the idea that they too will be destroyed. That is, they will be judged guilty by God and punished.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This whole expression is figurative language. Here “corrosion” (rust) refers to God’s judging and punishing rich people based on the evidence of their greed. The verb <em>consume</em> is used in an extended sense to mean “destroy.” The noun <em>flesh</em> refers to the entire “body.” (It does not refer to just the skin.) So this clause refers to God punishing (the bodies of) these rich people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this clause are:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It will eat your bodies (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Keep some of the figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it burns your body (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it will destroy your body (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and that same rust that destroys your<sup>(plur)</sup> wealth will destroy you<sup>(plur)</sup> too</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figurative language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of this</span> your<sup>(plur)</sup> bodies will be consumed</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and it will cause you<sup>(plur)</sup> to be destroyed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in hell</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That rust will so certainly condemn you that it will be as if the rust itself destroys you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and God will punish you</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>like fire:</strong> The phrase <em>like fire</em> is a comparison called a simile. In this simile, rust is compared to fire. One way that they are similar is that both destroy or consume things. Fire is a common image of God’s judgment in both the Old Testament scriptures (see, for example, Isaiah 30:27, 33) and in Jesus’ teaching (see, for example, Matthew 25:41).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate this phrase are:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like fire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">consumes/burns things</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like the fire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of God’s judgment</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>like the fire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of hell</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the simile. One way to do this is to translate the word <em>fire</em> with an adverb that strengthens your translation of the expression “will eat your flesh.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you<sup>(plur)</sup> will be <u>severely</u> punished</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will <u>harshly</u> punish you</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4>5:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You have hoarded treasure in the last days.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">foolishly</span> stored up many possessions in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the time of</span> the last days <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of this world</span>.</p></li><li><p>The world is about to end, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">yet</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> are gathering riches <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in case you may need them some day</span>!</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> are storing up wealth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for the future</span>. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But do you not realize that</span> the world is about to end <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and God will begin to judge people right after that?</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You have hoarded treasure:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>You have hoarded treasure</em> means “you have stored, gathered, or saved treasure.” This refers to all the possessions the rich people had gathered (in 5:2–3a).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have piled up riches (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have stored up riches (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you keep on storing up wealth (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> have accumulated many things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for yourselves</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the last days:</strong> There are two ways to interpret the phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the last days:</em></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>in the time of</u> the last days. James believed that he was already living in the final days before the end of the world. He was implying that it was foolish for rich people to continue gathering more and more possessions. They ought to realize that God would soon judge everyone in the world. For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in an age that is near its close <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, REB, NASB, ESV, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>in preparation for</u> the last days. According to this interpretation, the rich were hoarding wealth to prepare for the difficult times in the last days. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the last days <em>(RSV, NJB, NCV, KJV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The Greek preposition normally means “in” rather than “for.” Also, the expression “the last days” normally refers to all of the present age since the Day of Pentecost. James was implying that the days we live in will soon end with God’s Day of Judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>during these last days</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in this last period of time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before God judges people</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:3d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">James rebuked these rich people for hoarding wealth in the last days. This was a foolish thing to do. People hoard wealth in order to have it for the future. But if it is the last days, the world as they knew it would soon come to an end and judgment would follow. In your translation, you may want to show that hoarding wealth is not the wise or logical thing to do in the last days. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">foolishly</span> hoarded wealth in the last days.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The world is about to end, but/yet</span> you are storing up wealth.</p></blockquote></div>",

James wrote in the style of the Old Testament prophets using very harsh language and vivid, even frightening, images of God’s judgment. In your translation, you should use strong language that communicates the certainty of God’s judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">James wrote as though he were addressing rich people directly (“you rich people”). But he was not really expecting these rich people to read or to hear his letter. He was writing about rich people who were certainly unbelievers. They were not members of the Christian community. So this section is actually an encouragement to Christians. Many Christians were poor and were being exploited by wealthy landowners. James encouraged these Christians by telling them that, though they were suffering, God would judge the rich. He also wanted to warn them not to envy the rich and not to think or live like them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it will be more natural to use third person forms (“they,” “their,” “them”) throughout this section instead of second person forms (“you”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>Rich people <sup>1b</sup>should weep and wail <sup>1c</sup>because of the misery that is coming upon <u>them</u>. <sup>2a</sup><u>Their</u> wealth has rotted <sup>2b</sup>and moths have eaten <u>their</u> clothes. <sup>3a</sup><u>Their</u> gold and silver are corroded. <sup>3b</sup>This corrosion will testify against <u>them</u> <sup>3c</sup>and eat <u>their</u> flesh like fire. <sup>3d</sup><u>They</u> have hoarded wealth in the last days. <sup>4a</sup>Look!

They cheated their workers by refusing to pay them what they had agreed to pay.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Look:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>Look</em> calls attention to something surprising or shocking. It does not necessarily refer to something that can be seen with the eyes. Since the main event in this verse is “crying out,” it may be better to start with “Listen!” rather than with “look!” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen! (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Pay attention to</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Notice</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen to me</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not translate this word. Use a natural way in your language to call attention to what James said immediately following this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the wages you withheld from the workmen:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>withheld</em> also means “cheated,” “defrauded,” or “refused to pay.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You refused to pay the people who worked (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the pay you have held back from the workers (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who mowed your fields:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mowed</em> here refers to cutting the stalks of grain. This is the first process in harvesting grain.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who harvested your fields (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who worked in your fields (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who cut your grain</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are crying out against you:</strong> This is a figure of speech called personification. In this personification, James speaks of the unpaid wages as if they were people who cry out. The wages were crying out that they should be paid to the workmen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>crying out</em> implies that the wages were:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>complaining to the rich men who cheated. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Listen to their complaints! (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>asking God for help. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>shout <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> against you (GW)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:4a–b</strong></h5><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the personification.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Hear the cries of the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">There is a lot of new information in these verse parts. In many languages, it may be helpful to divide the long sentence into two or more separate clauses or sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a–b</sup>You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields, and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a–b</sup>You failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields. Look!

James said that their <em>cries</em> had <em>reached</em> God’s <em>ears.</em> This means that God had heard the workers’ complaints. James implied that God would soon punish the rich men for their sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this sentence are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the cries of the workers have been heard by the Lord All-Powerful.

It is a title for God that is literally “Lord of armies.” Even in the Old Testament, this title had come to mean “the supreme God” or “the Almighty God.” This means that God is the ruler of every power in the spiritual world.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord of Heaven’s Armies (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God, the Lord Almighty (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Supreme Chief/Ruler of all heavenly beings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord All-Powerful (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This title also occurs in Romans 9:29; Psalm 89:8; and Isaiah 6:3.

The rich people were indulging themselves, not doing any physical work and getting fat. They are just like animals that farmers allow not to work, but to enjoy eating and becoming fat before the farmer slaughters them for food.</p></li><li><p>By fattening themselves, both are unaware that they are preparing their own doom.

James wrote in the style of the Old Testament prophets using very harsh language and vivid, even frightening, images of God’s judgment. In your translation, you should use strong language that communicates the certainty of God’s judgment.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">James wrote as though he were addressing rich people directly (“you rich people”). But he was not really expecting these rich people to read or to hear his letter. He was writing about rich people who were certainly unbelievers. They were not members of the Christian community. So this section is actually an encouragement to Christians. Many Christians were poor and were being exploited by wealthy landowners. James encouraged these Christians by telling them that, though they were suffering, God would judge the rich. He also wanted to warn them not to envy the rich and not to think or live like them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it will be more natural to use third person forms (“they,” “their,” “them”) throughout this section instead of second person forms (“you”). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1a</sup>Rich people <sup>1b</sup>should weep and wail <sup>1c</sup>because of the misery that is coming upon <u>them</u>. <sup>2a</sup><u>Their</u> wealth has rotted <sup>2b</sup>and moths have eaten <u>their</u> clothes. <sup>3a</sup><u>Their</u> gold and silver are corroded. <sup>3b</sup>This corrosion will testify against <u>them</u> <sup>3c</sup>and eat <u>their</u> flesh like fire. <sup>3d</sup><u>They</u> have hoarded wealth in the last days. <sup>4a</sup>Look!

Christians should not resist but should be patient, waiting for the Lord to come and bring justice (5:7–8). The theme of patience in the midst of suffering is related to the opening theme of the letter (1:2–4). As well as being patient in suffering, Christians should be patient with one another (5:9). They should follow the example of the prophets of God (5:10–11). They should avoid swearing with oaths (5:12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Commentators disagree over which section the paragraph 5:12 belongs to. Many<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Huther, page 215, 217; Mitton, page 191; Davids (1982); Moo (1985), page 173.</span></span> of them say that it does not belong to this section (5:7–12) more than the next one (5:13–18), and prefer to set it off as separate from both. A few<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Laws, page 219; Martin, page 199; see also Ropes, page 300, for a similar view.</span></span> of them put it with 5:13–18 because it shares the same topic of referring to God when speaking. A few others<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, page 325; Adamson (1976), page 194; Hiebert, page 308.</span></span> (see also the NIV) put it with 5:7–11, because it is similar to 5:9. On the whole it seems best to put 5:12 with this section, but to make it a separate paragraph.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some other possible headings for this section are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers should be patient when they suffer</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Be patient; the Lord is coming (UBS)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1060005007\" data-endVerseId=\"1060005009\"><h3>Paragraph 5:7–9</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, James recommended that Christians be patient even though they were suffering.

They could be certain that God would treat them correctly and fairly in the end.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Endure <span data-bnType=\"implied\">suffering</span> without complaint</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Wait <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God to make things right</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many languages have an idiom for this word.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> introduces some strong advice to be patient. God is going to judge the rich for their unloving actions (5:1–6), and <u>therefore</u>, you should be patient until he does it (5:7–12).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>therefore (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For this reason</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Notice that the BSB places the word <em>brothers</em> at the end of 5:7a. This follows the Greek word order. In some languages, it is more natural to place this word at a different place in the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Brothers, be patient</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore, brothers, be patient</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore be patient until the coming of the Lord, brothers.</p></blockquote><h4>5:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>until the Lord’s coming.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>until the Lord returns.

He needs a good/bountiful harvest to have enough food to last during the coming year. It is also valuable when there is an extra portion of the harvest that the farmer can sell or trade for other things that his family needs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wait for their land to produce precious crops (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen.

In this context, the farmer waits quietly and does not get angry, even though he may be suffering from hunger and does not know if the rain will come at the right time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He patiently waits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He endures without complaint</p></blockquote><h4>5:7f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:7f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the fall and spring rains.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for the first/early rains and the last/late rains to fall.</p></li><li><p>for the necessary rains to fall <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that the crops grow and ripen well</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the fall and spring rains:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>for the fall and spring rains</em> is literally “until it receives the early and the late rain” (as in the RSV). Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>until the early and late rains have fallen (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the first and last rains to fall</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the rains to fall to make his crops grow</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In Israel, there are two periods when rain is very important for getting a good harvest. The rains during these times are called the “early rain” and the “late rain.” The “early rain” is expected in October, but it is sometimes very delayed. This period of rain is necessary so that the ground may become soft enough for planting seed, and so that the seeds then sprout. The “late rain” refers to showers in April and early May that help to ripen the crops. If these rains do not come, the harvest will be small.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:7c–f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to first talk about rains before mentioning the crop.

Blaming others is a way of judging them. It is accusing them of doing something wrong. So this “grumbling” leads to the consequent action mentioned in 5:9b. (See 4:11 and Matthew 7:1.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Donʼt grumble against each other (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do<sup>(plur)</sup> not talk against your fellow believers or accuse them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one another:</strong> The phrase <em>one another</em> refers to other Christians. Christians should not grumble against one another. See examples above for ways to translate this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> Notice that the BSB places the word <em>brothers</em> at the end of 5:9a. In some languages, it is more natural to place it at the beginning of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Brothers and sisters, do not complain against each other (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>brothers</em> last occurred in 5:7a.</p><h4>5:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you will not be judged.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Otherwise, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord</span> will condemn you.<sup>(plur)</sup></p></li><li><p>If you<sup>(plur)</sup> do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">complain</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord</span> will declare you to be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">guilty</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that you will not be judged:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates literally as <em>so that you will not be judged</em> indicates the basis for what James wrote in 5:9a. It indicates that James’ readers will be judged if they continue grumbling about one another.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>or you will be judged guilty (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if you<sup>(plur)</sup> do, you will be condemned</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will not be judged:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>will not be judged</em> here describes part of the process of judging. It is the part when a judge decides and declares that a person is guilty/wrong. Connected with this decision and pronouncement is the idea that the person will be punished. Here James was saying that the Lord will declare guilty the person who grumbles about another Christian brother.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will not be condemned</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will not be declared/pronounced to be wrong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will not be guilty <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of sin</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">God’s judgment here does not refer to eternal condemnation and punishment in hell. The word <em>judged</em> also occurs with a similar meaning in 2:12a and 2:13a. See judge, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">James did not say who would do the judging. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>It is God the Father. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that God will not judge you (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is preferable that you do not distinguish between God the Father and Jesus here. So if you must say who will judge, it is recommended that you say “the Lord.” In 5:8, James said that the Lord would soon come, and in 5:9c he said that the Judge is standing at the door. It is likely that he was thinking about the same event.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In 4:12 James said that there was only one Judge, God, the Lawgiver. But most commentators think that here James is thinking of Christ, who is soon to come back (see Martin, page 192; Hiebert, page 301; SSA, page 146; cf. Ropes, page 297; Laws, page 213).</span></span></p><h4>5:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Look, the Judge is standing at the door!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The judge is arriving soon!</p></li><li><p>The one who will judge everybody is ready to come <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to/into our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">world again</span>!</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Lord</span> will soon be here, and he will be the judge!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Look:</strong> In Greek, this sentence begins with a word that the BSB translates as <em>Look</em> and the RSV translates as “behold”. This word calls attention to something surprising. The NIV uses an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence to show this surprise.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not be surprised!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Listen to this!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should use whatever expression is natural in your language for showing surprise. This same word occurs in 5:4a–b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Judge:</strong> Commentators disagree as to whether <em>the Judge</em> refers to the Lord Jesus Christ or to God the Father. If you have made explicit who will judge in 5:9b, you will need to make sure that this refers to the same person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you need to make it clear that James is not referring to a human <em>judge</em> it is recommended that you say “the Lord.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord, the one who will judge all people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See judge, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>standing at the door:</strong> This is a Greek idiom. It means “nearly here” (as in Matthew 24:33). There are at least two ways to translate this idiom:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the idiom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>stands before the gates! (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>right outside the door (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>ready to appear. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>ready to come! (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul>",

(CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They suffered many hard things, but they were patient. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>patience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>patience</em> is related to the verb “be patient” in 5:7a,e and 5:8a. Use a word or expression that corresponds to what you used in those verses.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>affliction:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>affliction</em> here refers to suffering physical pain caused by others treating them badly.

Take them as examples (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>follow the example of the prophets (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>prophets:</strong> The word <em>prophets</em> refers to men who spoke on behalf of God. They told people what God revealed to them. God gave some prophets power to work miracles. These miracles helped people realize that God had sent the prophet.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Many prophets were persecuted and even killed, but they remained faithful to God despite their suffering.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>prophets</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spokesmen for God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men who speak God’s words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s message-speakers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is good to use a general term that does not focus only on foretelling the future. Although prophets did foretell the future, they also gave people other messages from God. They especially told them to stop sinning and to obey God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When choosing a term for prophet, consider how you will distinguish prophet from other words which are similar in meaning such as “angel,” “apostle,” and “preacher.”</p><h4>5:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who spoke in the name of the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who spoke on behalf of the Lord.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They suffered because</span> they spoke <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span> the messages that the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">told them to speak</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who spoke in the name of the Lord:</strong> The phrase <em>who spoke in the name of the Lord</em> indicates that the prophets spoke with the Lord’s authority.

Job continued to trust God even when he had lost his wealth, his family and his health.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You have heard of Job’s perseverance:</strong> The Greek noun that the BSB translates as <em>perseverance</em> also means “endurance.” It refers to remaining loyal and steadfast.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You have heard about Job’s endurance.

According to this interpretation, the whole phrase means “the outcome that the Lord gave.” For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how the Lord provided for him in the end <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NASB, REB, GW, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>the purpose</u>, the goal that was in view. For example, the ESV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the purpose of the Lord <em>(RSV, NET, NCV, NJB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In 5:7 James not only urged Christians to be patient in the midst of suffering, but he also promised a happy ending (“the coming of the Lord”). Similarly, the farmer’s crop receives the rain in the end. So also here it is probable that James was referring not only to the fact that Job was steadfast in his faith, but to the way the Lord blessed him in the end. God finally restored Job’s family, wealth, and health (see Job 42:10–17). So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and how the Lord finally helped him. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Lord’s plan finally ended in good (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> Here <em>the Lord</em> refers to God, the one with supreme authority.

There are two ways to interpret this word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>It means <u>that</u> or <u>how</u> and introduces something else that James’ readers had understood. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>realising <u>that</u> the Lord is kind… <em>(KJV, NASB, RSV, NJB, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>because</u> or <u>for</u> and introduces a reason for how God treated Job. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>For</u> the Lord is full of mercy… <em>(GNT, REB, GW, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). What happened to Job showed James’ readers that the Lord was gracious. The BSB does not explicitly translate this word, but it is probably following the first interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The Lord is full of compassion and mercy:</strong> The clause <em>The Lord is full of compassion and mercy</em> means that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful. Some other ways to translate this clause are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Lord <u>is</u> compassionate and merciful (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord <u>has</u> much compassion and mercy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>compassion and mercy:</strong> The words <em>compassion</em> and <em>mercy</em> are a doublet. This means that they have almost the same meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>compassion</em> means “kind-hearted,” or “having much pity on people.” The word <em>mercy</em> means “compassionate” or “showing kindness towards people who suffer or who are in need.” (The word <em>mercy</em> also occurs in 2:13 and 3:17.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate these words are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>loving and kind</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tenderness and pity</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be more natural to use a single expression that is intensified or emphasized.

Christians should not resist but should be patient, waiting for the Lord to come and bring justice (5:7–8). The theme of patience in the midst of suffering is related to the opening theme of the letter (1:2–4). As well as being patient in suffering, Christians should be patient with one another (5:9). They should follow the example of the prophets of God (5:10–11). They should avoid swearing with oaths (5:12).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Commentators disagree over which section the paragraph 5:12 belongs to.

They swore oaths when they made promises or threats, or when they wanted to strengthen the statement they were making. Some examples from the Bible are: 1 Samuel 1:26, 20:3, 20:12; 1 Kings 17:1; Matthew 14:7, 26:72. James here taught that Christian people should avoid oaths.</p></div><h4>5:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Above all, my brothers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Above all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I have just said</span>, my brothers,</p></li><li><p>¶ My fellow believers, more important than everything else is this:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Above all:</strong> The phrase <em>Above all</em> here means “most of all,” or “most important of all.” James was probably ranking the avoidance of swearing oaths as even more important than avoiding other sins of the tongue such as grumbling.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Mayor, page 161; Ropes, page 300; Adamson (1976), page 194. Huther, page 215, thinks the comparison is with all the other warnings of the epistle. Other commentators think that James meant, “What I am going to say now is extremely important,” and that he was not comparing the importance of this topic with the importance of what he had said before. See Davids (1982), page 189; Mitton, page 191; Hiebert, page 308; Laws, pages 219–220; Martin, page 203.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But most of all (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>It is of the highest importance (JBP)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Most importantly</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my brothers:</strong> Notice that the BSB places the phrase <em>my brothers</em> at the end of 5:12a. This follows the word order of the Greek text. In some languages, it is more natural to place it at the beginning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My friends, if any of you wander away from the truth... (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is not natural to repeat <em>my brothers</em> so often. Read 5:7–12 to see if it would be more natural to omit one or more of the phrases <em>my brothers.</em></p><h4>5:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>do not swear,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>do<sup>(plur)</sup> not swear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with/by oaths</span>.</p></li><li><p>do not use oaths <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to convince others that you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are telling the truth</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do not swear:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>swear</em> refers to calling upon God or some other being or object to be a witness that what you are saying is true. It is implied that God will punish you if what you are saying is not true. James said that his readers should stop swearing or using oaths.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this word is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not use an oath (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure to distinguish the word “swear” from the words “curse” and “bad words/language.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If there is no expression that refers to this word in your language, you may need to explain what James means. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not call on God to punish you if you are lying</p></blockquote><h4>5:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not by heaven or earth</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should not swear</span> by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of</span> heaven or by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of</span> this world,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">For instance: Do</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">not use an oath saying that</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something/someone in</span> heaven or earth</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not by heaven or earth:</strong> The phrase <em>by heaven or earth</em> means “calling on heaven or earth as a witness that you are telling the truth.” These are examples of the common oaths that the Jews used in the days when James wrote. In this context, <em>heaven</em> means the place where God lives, and <em>earth</em> means this world where human beings live.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be natural to translate this phrase as a separate sentence. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t use the name of heaven, earth…to prove what you say (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not swear by using anything in heaven or on earth to support your words</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See heaven, meaning 2, in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>5:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or by any other oath.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the name of</span> anything else.</p></li><li><p>or anything else is your witness that you are telling the truth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or by any other oath:</strong> The phrase <em>or by any other oath</em> means “do not swear by using anything else as a witness that you are telling the truth.”</p><h4>5:12e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:12e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Simply let your “Yes” be yes, and your “No,” no,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When you mean yes, say only yes, and when you mean no, say only no.

This is because a person who is in the habit of swearing oaths will sooner or later break his promise or tell a lie. So he will be guilty of using God’s name in an unacceptable way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fall under judgment:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates literally as <em>fall under judgment</em> mean “be declared/judged guilty” of having done something wrong. This also includes the idea that the person will be punished for doing wrong.

The oil was used as a medicine. It was also used symbolically.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most commentators think that here the oil was used as a symbol of the healing power of God. It was poured or dripped onto the head of the person.

The action of anointing is less important. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>let them pray over him, anointing him with oil</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>oil:</strong> The oil that people used was olive oil. It was the common oil of that country. You should use a term that refers to a common type of oil that people use for cooking or to put on their bodies.

This means that the elders who were praying needed to have faith or trust in God. James did not say what they should be trusting God for, but it is implied that they should trust him to heal the sick person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are at least three ways to interpret the word faith here. (1) Some commentators say that faith here is faith that God will heal the sick person. (2) Other commentators say that faith here is a more general faith. It is a belief that God is good, that he can be trusted, that he delights in answering prayer, and that he can answer prayer. (3) Other commentators say that faith here is an unwavering commitment to God and Jesus as the Messiah.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when they pray <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> and they trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that he will make the sick one well</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See believe, meaning 3, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the prayer:</strong> The phrase <em>the prayer</em> refers back to the prayer mentioned in 5:14. In some languages, it is more natural to translate the noun <em>prayer</em> with a verb. For instance:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When they pray to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>offered:</strong> The word <em>offered</em> has been supplied by the BSB. It is formal language and simply means that the prayer is prayed or spoken to God. Another way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that is said (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you translate the phrase “the prayer” with a verb, you do not need to translate the word <em>offered.</em></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in faith:</strong> The phrase <em>in faith</em> means “while believing.” Here it refers to the faith of those who are praying. In some languages, it is more natural to translate <em>faith</em> with a verb or clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pray believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that the Lord will heal</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trusting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord to heal the sick person</span></p></blockquote><h4>5:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will restore the one who is sick.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will cause you<sup>(sing)</sup> to be healed.</p></li><li><p>the sick person, he will be healed.</p></li><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> will get well,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will restore:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>will restore</em> is literally “will save” (as in the RSV). In the context of a very sick person, it means “will heal,” or “will make well.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will heal (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will cure (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will cause…to become well</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See save, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>5:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The Lord will raise him up.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The Lord will make you<sup>(sing)</sup> well.</p></li><li><p>The Lord will heal him.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span> will do it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The Lord will raise him up:</strong> This clause explains the clause “will…make well” (in 5:15b).

It is implied that this sin may have something to do with his sickness. But do not translate this in such a way as to suggest that everyone who is sick has sinned.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sinned:</strong> The word <em>sinned</em> refers to doing something that is against God’s will and God’s law. This includes acts, thoughts, and attitudes. In other words, sin means to do anything that violates God’s standard of what is right or good.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>disobeyed God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>done wrong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>done something against God’s will</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The noun sin occurs in 1:15b.</p><h4>5:15e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he will be forgiven.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you<sup>(sing)</sup> will receive forgiveness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the Lord</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will forgive him.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will forgive your<sup>(sing)</sup> sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he will be forgiven:</strong> This is a passive clause.

Then he gave them detailed instructions and encouraged them to pray for the sick (5:14–16).</p></div><h4>5:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore confess your sins to each other</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Therefore, you<sup>(plur)</sup> should confess/tell your sins to one another</p></li><li><p>So you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> should admit to other believers that you have disobeyed God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>Therefore</em> here introduces a command to do something based on what James had just written. God heals sick people in answer to prayer, even if they have sinned (5:15). So people who are sick should seek to be healed by confessing their sins. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For this reason</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because of that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>On the basis <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of what I have just said</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>confess:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>confess</em> means “openly admit” to another person that one has disobeyed God. In this context, it does not mean praying silently to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>admit (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you should tell each other what you have done (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your sins:</strong> The word <em>sins</em> here refers to anything that a person has done that is contrary to God’s will and desire for his people. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the things that you have done wrong</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your evil thoughts and deeds</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>your wrongs</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to each other:</strong> The phrase <em>to each other</em> refers to other members of the church. Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to one another</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to your fellow believers</p></blockquote><h4>5:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and pray for each other</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and pray<sup>(plur)</sup> for one another,</p></li><li><p>Pray<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> for each other</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and pray for each other:</strong> The word <em>pray</em> means “ask God.” In this context of a person confessing that he has sinned, the topic of the prayer is clear. Here <em>pray for</em> implies that they will ask God to forgive and heal this member of the church. Some other ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and pray <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> for one another</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and ask <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to heal and forgive</span> you and your fellow believers</p></blockquote><h4>5:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you may be healed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you<sup>(plur)</sup> will be cured.</p></li><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Lord</span> will make you<sup>(plur)</sup> well.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that you may be healed:</strong> The purpose of the prayer is <em>so that you may be healed.</em> It is a passive clause.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When a believing person prays (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a righteous man:</strong> The phrase <em>a righteous man</em> means “a person who lives in the way that God requires.” Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person who does what is right/just</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person who follows/keeps God’s laws</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a straight person</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This same word occurs in 5:6a where the NIV translates it as “innocent men.” See righteous, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><h4>5:16e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>has great power to prevail.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>is very powerful and causes great things to happen.</p></li><li><p>great results happen.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has great power to prevail:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>power to prevail</em> indicates that when a righteous person prays, it causes great things to happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has great power and produces wonderful results (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>is powerful, and it can help a lot (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it will be natural to translate <em>power to prevail</em> as one phrase that is emphasized.

(See 1 Kings chapters 17–18.) This story was well known to James’ readers. Elijah saw how the people of his country had turned to evil, and so he prayed that God would punish them by sending no rain on their land.</p><h4>5:17a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Elijah was a man just like us.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Consider</span><sup>(plur)</sup> Elijah. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> was a human being, just as we<sup>(incl)</sup> are.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">For example,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the prophet</span> Elijah was a human just like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the rest of</span> us.<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Elijah:</strong> Elijah was a prophet who lived 900 years before James. In some languages, it may be more natural to make some of this information explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Elijah the prophet</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Elijah the prophet of long ago</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was a man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> here means “human being.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was a human being (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was a mere human</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just like us:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>just like us</em> means “has the same kind of desires and feelings as we do.” The Jews thought of Elijah as an extraordinary person, so James reminded them that he was a normal human being.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as we are (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with a nature like ours (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the same kind of person as we are (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This word also occurs in Acts 14:15.</p><h4>5:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He prayed earnestly</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He prayed sincerely/fervently</p></li><li><p>He prayed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> very hard</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He prayed earnestly:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>He prayed earnestly</em> is literally “He prayed with prayer.” This double use of the word “pray” intensifies what James was saying. He meant that when Elijah prayed, he was sincere, serious, and eager to receive an answer. Use what is natural in your language to indicate this intensity of prayer. Use an idiom if that is appropriate. For example, some English idioms for this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He prayed hard</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He prayed with his whole heart</p></blockquote><h4>5:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and no rain fell on the land for three and a half years.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So then</span> there was no rain in the country <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Israel</span> for three and a half years.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it did not rain on the land:</strong> The phrase <em>on the land</em> refers to the land of Israel.

In 5:19 James described figuratively something that may happen to a Christian: a person strays away from God, and someone brings him back. In 5:20 James commented that bringing this person back into a relationship with God is a worthwhile thing to do.</p></div><h4>5:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>consider this:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he should know/realize that</p></li><li><p>that person may be sure that</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>consider this:</strong> There is a textual issue in this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek texts have “<u>He</u> should know.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Huther, page 226; Ropes, page 315; Hiebert, pages 334–335; Mitton, page 212; Adamson (1976), page 203; Laws, pages 239–240; Davids (1982), page 199; Martin, page 217. This is the reading of most editions of the Greek text, including the UBS 3rd ed. and 4th ed.</span></span> For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let him know that <em>(RSV, NJB, NASB, KJV, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Other Greek texts have “<u>You</u><sup>(plur)</sup> should know.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alford, page 329; Mayor, page 176. This is the reading of Nestle’s 25th ed. and the UBS 1st ed. Greek texts.</span></span> For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>remember this <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NRSV, REB, GW, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The evidence shows that option (1) is more likely to be the original text. It means that the person who brings his Christian brother back to believing and obeying God’s truth should know that he has done a good thing. To reflect this meaning, the NET translation is used as the source line in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>may he realize that</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he can be sure that</p></blockquote><h4>5:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>whoever brings a sinner back from his wandering/straying path</p></li><li><p>anyone who helps/causes an evildoer to return <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> from his sin</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 5:20b, James continued to use the same figures of speech about wandering away and someone bringing the person back.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Whoever turns:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB here translates as <em>turns</em> is the same as the word translated as “bring back” in 5:19b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whoever brings a sinner back (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a sinner:</strong> The word <em>sinner</em> refers to a person who habitually disobeys God. Some other ways to translate this word are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a sinful person</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>someone who disobeys God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person who does evil</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note at 4:8c for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the error of his way:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>error</em> is the noun form of the verb translated “wander” in 5:19a. The phrase <em>his way</em> refers to the path that he has taken. It means the kind of life he has been living. So the whole phrase refers to returning the sinner back “from the wandering/straying path.” It means to help the sinner repent from his life or behavior that no longer pleases God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from his wandering path (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from his wandering (ESV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the wrong way (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from his wrong living</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from doing bad things</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be possible to leave this phrase implicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>20b</sup>whoever brings the sinner back <sup>20c</sup>will save that person (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>5:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will save his soul from death</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>saves that person from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternal</span> death.</p></li><li><p>rescues that person from hell.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will save his soul from death:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>will save his soul from death</em> means that the person whose words and prayers help the sinner stop sinning and return to obeying God “will save the sinner from dying.” In this context of “saving his soul,” <em>death</em> refers to spiritual death. It is being eternally separated from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to make it clear that this refers to spiritual death are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will save that sinner’s soul from death (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will save the soul of that sinner so that he does not go to hell</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will rescue from eternal death the one who has been doing evil</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is more natural to translate the noun <em>death</em> with a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will keep him from dying spiritually</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>save him from being punished <span data-bnType=\"implied\">eternally</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>save:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>save</em> here means “rescue” or “deliver.” The righteous person will be the means that God uses to <em>save</em> from spiritual death the person who went astray. See save, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>his soul:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates literally as <em>his soul</em> means his real inner self, in contrast to his body. This is the part of the person that is eternal. Here <em>his soul</em> refers to the soul of the sinner who has turned from the error of his ways.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>him</p></blockquote><h4>5:20d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:20d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and cover over a multitude of sins.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He causes God not to look at that person’s many evil deeds anymore.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will forgive the many sins <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the one he brought back</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>cover over:</strong> This is a figure of speech. The righteous person covers over the sins of the person who has wandered from the path of God’s way to live. This implies that God decides not to look at those sins anymore. It means that God forgives the sins. It does not mean that the righteous person has hidden the other person’s sins from God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two ways to translate this figure of speech:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will cover a multitude of sins (NRSV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and will cause many sins to be forgiven. (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will forgive his many sins.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a multitude of sins:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>a multitude of sins</em> means “very many sins.” Make sure that in your language this expression does not mean “most but not all.” James did not mean that some sins would not be covered. All will be forgiven.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:19–20</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be natural to break up this long sentence into two or more smaller sentences. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>19a</sup>My brothers, perhaps one of you will wander from the truth. <sup>19b</sup>If that happens, someone can bring that person back. <sup>20a</sup>He should know that <sup>20b</sup>whoever brings a sinner back from the error of his ways <sup>20c</sup>will save him from death. <sup>20d</sup>Also, his many sins will be forgiven.</p></blockquote></div>",
