Then they put the name of the person or group they were writing to. They usually included some kind of blessing. All of these are in the first two verses of this letter to the Philippians. In some languages the recipients are always mentioned first. If it is not polite to put the author’s name first, it may be necessary to reorder this introduction so that the Philippians are mentioned first, and then Paul and Timothy. However, try to maintain the original order if possible in order to accurately reflect how Paul actually began his letter.</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from</span> Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span>, Paul,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span>, Paul, together with Timothy, as servants of Christ Jesus,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from</span> Paul, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from</span> Timothy too. We<sup>(excl)</sup> serve Christ Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul and Timothy:</strong> Commentators agree that only Paul was the author of the letter to the Philippians. The reason is that the author used the first person singular “I” and “me,” not “we,” throughout the rest of the letter, and he referred to Timothy in the third person as “he” or “him” or “Timothy.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The fact that Paul mentioned Timothy’s name here may imply that Paul consulted Timothy when he wrote the letter. Or perhaps Timothy wrote the letter while Paul told him what to write. Certainly Timothy was with Paul and agreed with what Paul said in the letter. Two ways of showing this in the translation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Timothy joins me in writing to you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I and Timothy are sending this letter to you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Timothy:</strong> In some languages it is necessary to introduce a new participant such as a secondary author with a short phrase such as “our brother Timothy.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>servants:</strong> The Greek word <em>doulos</em> means “slave.” Most English versions translate it here as “servant,” but the term refers to a worker who was not paid and who was not free to leave his employment. It may therefore be better to use your word for “slave” here. Paul was not saying that he and Timothy were servants or slaves of people. He meant that they belonged to Jesus and served him as their master. This was not degrading to them but was a position of honor and dignity.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> There are seven Greek forms of Jesus’ name or title in Philippians. A literal translation of these is:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Christ Jesus,</p></li><li><p>Jesus Christ,</p></li><li><p>Lord Jesus,</p></li><li><p>Lord Jesus Christ,</p></li><li><p>Jesus,</p></li><li><p>Lord, and</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Christ.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">You need to decide how you will translate each of these seven names or titles so you can use them consistently throughout the New Testament. The two phrases “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” mean the same thing. However, the New Testament writer may have had a reason to put one name first in each case, perhaps for emphasis.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A common way to put emphasis on a word in Greek is to put that word first. If the word “Christ” comes first in the phrase, there may be an emphasis on the title <u>Messiah</u>. If the word “Jesus” comes first, the author may have been thinking of the phrase “Jesus Christ” as a name, or perhaps he was thinking of Jesus as a human being. But there is no explicit example in the New Testament showing that this was the emphasis intended by the author.</span></span> However, there is no way to be sure this is what the authors meant. The <em>Translator’s Notes on Philippians</em> follows the literal order of the Greek in such phrases. But in your language, you must decide whether to translate the phrase <em>Christ Jesus</em> literally as “Christ Jesus” or whether to translate it as “Jesus Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used in two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels it is used as a title for Jesus. It was the Greek equivalent of “Messiah,” which literally means “the person who has been anointed.” However, by the time Paul was writing his letters, it had become a name for Jesus rather than a title. So here and in the other New Testament letters, you should simply spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing</span> to all God’s people in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Philippi, those who belong to Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is</span> to/for all of you who live in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the town of</span> Philippi who belong to God because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has done</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To:</strong> The Greek does not have a verb here, and in some languages it is necessary to supply one. For example: “Paul and Timothy…<u>write</u> to all the saints…” Another possible verb is “send,” implying “send this letter.” In the context of the whole letter, it seems most likely that “write” is the implied verb here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>No commentary support has been found for the idea that the implied verb here is “greet” or “send greetings.” Also, if the translator used “greet” here, the resulting phrase “greet to all the saints” would not fit grammatically. The greetings are in 4:21–22. Paul’s greetings normally came at the end of his letters.</span></span> If a verb is supplied, it may also be necessary to supply a first person pronoun (“I” or “we”) as the subject.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the saints:</strong> This is literally “the holy ones” or “the holy people.” It refers to those whom God has set apart for himself. Some versions avoid the word <em>saints</em> because this word has come to be used only for a few special people. But the word <em>saints</em> in the New Testament in fact refers to all Christians. See “holy&quot;, sense A3a in KBT. Possible translations are “God’s people,” “God’s chosen people,” “Christians,” “people who belong to God” or “people whom God has set apart for himself.” This word appears again in 4:21–22.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> and similar phrases such as “in the Lord” and “in him” occur twenty-two times in Paul’s letter to the Philippians. Most English translations keep the literal wording <em>in Christ Jesus</em> here, and this is also possible in many other languages. This phrase means to be united with Christ, to personally relate to him and to belong to him. A book that Hale wrote (1991) specifically about this topic is helpful (see Bibliography).</p><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>together with the overseers and deacons:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter also goes to</span> those who are leaders <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you</span> and those who help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>together with:</strong> Paul probably meant that he was including the overseers and deacons among “the saints” to whom he was writing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>overseers and deacons:</strong> Most commentators agree that at the time Paul wrote this letter, the church did not yet have clearly defined leadership positions or titles, but they did have leaders. Although their exact duties are not certain, it is clear that <em>overseers and deacons</em> were the recognized leaders within the church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>overseers:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>overseers</em> is translated by some English versions as “bishops.” It refers to teachers, leaders and others in positions of authority. In some languages it can be translated by an expression meaning “leaders,” “those who watch over the believers,” or “church elders.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deacons:</strong> The word <em>deacons</em> refers to people who served as assistants to the overseers and managed practical matters. You could translate the word <em>deacons</em> as “helpers,” “those who work for God among the believers,” or “those who help the believers.” In some languages there is already an accepted church term for “deacon,” so the translator must decide whether he will use that term or another term.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the BSB order (“saints,” “overseers,” <em>deacons</em>) might imply that the elders and deacons were not among the saints. If this is true in your language, you could reverse the order and translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to the overseers and deacons and to all the other saints.</p></blockquote>",

It was like a prayer or a blessing. You may need to use the verb “pray” or “ask/request God” in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We pray that God will give</span> you grace and peace.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Even if in your language you normally translate <em>Grace</em> or <em>peace</em> as a long phrase, you may want to use something shorter in a Christian greeting like this. Here Paul was not actually teaching about <em>Grace</em> and <em>peace</em>, and so it may not be necessary to include all the elements normally associated with these terms.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The Greek word <em>charis</em> that the BSB translates as <em>Grace</em> here means “favor, goodwill, kindness, blessing.” See “grace&quot; in KBT. Paul wanted God to show kindness and favor to the Philippian Christians. This is an important term in the New Testament, although it appears only three times in Philippians (see also 1:7 and 4:23). In some languages it may be necessary to translate the noun <em>Grace</em> as a verb. So you might translate the phrase “Grace…to you” in the following ways:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I pray that God will be very good to you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God act favorably toward you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Greek word <em>eirēnē</em> that the BSB translates as <em>peace</em> means “well-being” or “absence of conflict.” It refers mainly to peace with God but may also have the secondary meanings of peace with man and peace of heart (a person’s own inner peace). See “peace&quot; in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> The Greek form here is plural. This pronoun appears frequently throughout the book of Philippians and (except for 4:3) is always plural, because Paul was addressing the letter to all the Philippian Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our Father:</strong> God is called <em>our Father</em> because he is the one who gives us both physical and spiritual life. He loves us as a father does and has adopted us as his children. We are to love, trust and obey him as children do their earthly fathers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our:</strong> In this letter Paul almost always includes the Philippian Christians as well as himself when he says “us” or <em>our</em>. See the note on “we” in 3:17b for an exception to this.</p>",

In Greek emphasis could be shown by repetition, and in these verses Paul repeated the idea of “all” (<u>every</u> time, <u>all</u> my prayers, <u>all</u> of you, <u>always</u>) and the idea of “prayer.” Try to find a natural way to show this emphasis in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy:</strong> Paul meant that whenever he prayed for the Philippians, he prayed for all of them with joy. The emphasis of the verse is on Paul’s joy. Make sure your translation does not imply that sometimes Paul only prayed for some of the Philippians and then he was not joyful. It may be necessary to make the meaning clear by saying something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Every time I pray for you, I ask God to help all of you and I always rejoice.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>In every prayer:</strong> This is literally “in every prayer of mine.” It could be translated as “every time I pray.” It may indicate that Paul prayed for the Philippians at each of his set times of prayer.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prayer…pray:</strong> In Greek these are both the noun meaning “supplication.” It may be necessary to translate both of them with a verb meaning “to pray, beg, ask God for help.” Paul was asking God to help the Philippians. The word you use for <em>prayer</em> should include the concept of asking God for something.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Although the word for <em>prayer</em> occurs twice in the original Greek, in your language it may be unnatural to repeat the word. If that is the case, perhaps the same meaning can be obtained by using one verb or two synonyms (see Display).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>with joy:</strong> This means “with happiness,” “joyfully” or “because I am happy.”</p>",

The two phrases both mean that as soon as they had accepted the gospel, the Philippians immediately began to cooperate with Paul in spreading the gospel to others. It will probably be helpful for you to make explicit in your translation the implied information that <em>the first day</em> means the time the Philippians first believed the gospel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>from the first day you believed (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>until now:</strong> This means “you are still doing it.” It does not mean they stopped helping Paul at the time when he wrote the letter.

They were a great help to him in preaching the gospel, and Paul loved them deeply.</p></div><h4>1:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am sure about what I am about to say: <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>, who has begun doing good in your hearts,</p></li><li><p>And of this I am certain: God has started to do something good within you, and he</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>being confident:</strong> This means “being sure” or “strongly believing.” In many languages it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here and to translate this as “I am confident” or “I am certain” or “I am convinced.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of this:</strong> This is an emphatic phrase, literally, “of this very thing.” This phrase is pointing forward to what follows: Paul is sure about what God will continue to do. Some English translations (for example, RSV, GNT, NCV, CEV, NLT) either do not translate this phrase or understand it as emphasizing “confident.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>quite confident (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I’m convinced (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">But most commentators and translations understand this phrase to be emphasizing what Paul is confident about (BSB, NET, NIV, REB, NRSV, NASB, KJV). If in your language it is possible to place emphasis on what Paul is sure of, that would be appropriate here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who began a good work in you:</strong> <em>He</em> refers to God. There are two interpretations of the <em>good work</em> that he began:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The <em>good work</em> that God began was the salvation and new life that God gave them when they believed the gospel. When the Philippians received the gospel, God did something in them that changed who they were.</p></li><li><p>The <em>good work</em> that God began was their work of cooperating in the spread of the gospel. This understanding is signaled by the insertion of the word “this” in GNT, CEV, and GW. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God, who began this good work in you (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most translations do not insert the word “this” and so are probably following the first interpretation. It is recommended that, along with the majority of commentators, you also follow first interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate the noun <em>work</em> with a verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The one who has begun to do something good in you….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may also be necessary to express the idea <em>began</em> as a marker on the following verb (“work,” “make” or “do”) instead of as a separate word.</p><h4>1:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will keep doing it until he has completely finished it when Christ Jesus comes back <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will carry it on to completion:</strong> In the Greek this is a single verb meaning “will complete, finish, accomplish.” God began the good work of salvation within the Philippians and would continue to work in them to change them into godly people. In some languages the best way to express the idea of “complete” or <em>completion</em> will be to put it in a sentence at the end of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will continue doing this good work in you until Christ Jesus returns. At that time it will be complete.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until the day of Christ Jesus:</strong> The Greek word <em>achri</em> translated by the BSB as <em>until</em> has been understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “until.” God will keep on finishing what he has begun until the time when Christ returns. At that time his work will be complete. <em>(BSB, KJV, NIV, NASB, NJB, NET)</em></p></li><li><p>It means “at” or “on.” God will complete his work on the day that Christ returns. <em>(RSV, GNT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Compare a similar phrase in 1:10 and the notes there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the day of Christ Jesus:</strong> This refers to the time Christ will come back. You could translate it as “when Christ Jesus returns to the earth.” This phrase occurs three times in Philippians (see also 1:10 and 2:16) and in several other New Testament passages.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> There is a textual problem with this part of the verse. Different Greek manuscripts say different things. The two possible readings are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions have <em>Christ Jesus</em> <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NASB, REB, CEV, NLT, NET)</em></p></li><li><p>Some versions have “Jesus Christ”. <em>(RSV, NCV, NJB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning is the same, but the reading <em>Christ Jesus</em> has the best manuscript support and it is recommended that you follow it (1).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:6</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">It may be necessary in some languages to put the words of this verse in a different order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God has begun a good work in you, and I am confident that he will keep on completing it until the day of Christ Jesus.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am sure that God will keep on doing this good work that he has started in you until Christ Jesus returns. Then it will be complete.</p></blockquote></div>",

That is why it is natural for me to think about you in this way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this verse begins with a conjunction meaning “just as, for.” The BSB moves it to the beginning of 1:7b to make more natural English, but if it is more natural in your language to use such a connection in 1:7a, you should do so.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It is right:</strong> This means “it is proper, it is appropriate, it is good.” In some languages it may be better to put it in the negative; for example, “it is not strange.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>feel this way:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>feel</em> is translated as “think” in most contexts. It refers to the activity of the mind and will, and is not just an emotion. The phrase <em>this way</em> refers back to all the things that Paul had said about why he was thankful for the Philippians in 1:3–6.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have you in my heart:</strong> This Greek idiom means “I love you very much.”</p><h4>1:7b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel:</strong> The Greek is literally “in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.” Neither the Greek nor the BSB translation means that Paul was in prison at one time and proclaimed the gospel at another time. Even while he was in prison, he was proclaiming the gospel. It is therefore better not to follow the GNT here (“both now that I am in prison and also while I was free to defend…”).</p><h4>1:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For in my chains</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For while I am chained here in prison,</p></li><li><p>While I am a prisoner</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in my chains:</strong> The phrase <em>in…chains</em> translates a Greek idiom for being in prison. But it also implies that the guards literally tied Paul up or chained him to something so he could not escape.</p><h4>1:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and while I have been answering criticisms of the gospel and demonstrating that the gospel is true,</p></li><li><p>and when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am in court</span> defending the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus Christ</span> and proving/showing that it is true,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my defense and confirmation of the gospel:</strong> It is possible to interpret this phrase two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to a court trial. Paul defended the gospel and proved its truth in a Roman court.</p></li><li><p>It refers more generally to any time Paul was explaining the gospel and showing why it was true.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul may have had both of these in mind, and in some languages the translation can allow for both interpretations. However, if you must choose, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my defense…of the gospel:</strong> This means that Paul was explaining why the gospel was not false. He tried to remove objections and to show that criticisms of the gospel were wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>confirmation of the gospel:</strong> This means basically the same thing as “defense…of the gospel,” but from a positive angle: Paul was explaining why the gospel was true. In your translation, you may need to combine the ideas “defense” and <em>confirmation</em> into one phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>explaining to enemies of the good news why it is true beyond doubt</p></blockquote><h4>1:7d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you are all partners in grace with me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>God is graciously causing us<sup>(incl)</sup> all to be partners <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the work of telling the good news</span>.</p></li><li><p>God is kindly allowing all of us<sup>(incl)</sup> to work together <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to tell the good news</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you are all partners in grace with me:</strong> In Greek this literally says “sharers of me of grace.” It is therefore not clear how the word meaning “of me” (or “my”) is connected to the rest of the phrase. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected to the word “sharers.” This means that Paul and the Philippians shared together in God’s grace. The word <em>grace</em> thus refers to God’s goodness toward Paul and the Philippians, a goodness that he showed in letting them work for him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We have shared together the blessings of God (NLT) <em>(RSV, NIV, NLT, NASB, NET, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to the word <em>grace</em>. In this case “my” <em>grace</em> means the special grace that God gave to Paul as an apostle. The Philippians shared in Paul’s grace by supporting him financially. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All of you have helped in the work that God has given me (CEV) <em>(GNT, NJB, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1). God was kind to both Paul and the Philippians and gave them the privilege of working together to spread the gospel.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:7b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">It may be clearer in some languages to alter the order of the phrases in 1:7b–d and to place 1:7d before 1:7b–c. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is kindly allowing us to work together <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in telling the good news about Jesus Christ,</span> whether I am in prison or whether I am defending the good news and proving/showing that the good news is true.</p></blockquote></div>",

God knows this is true.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek this verse begins with a connecting word meaning “for.” The BSB does not translate this word, but if it is natural in your language, you may use such a connecting word here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God is my witness:</strong> Paul used this phrase when there was no human witness, and especially when he was referring to his thoughts, feelings and attitudes. He meant that God was his witness and could verify that he was telling the truth. He said this five times in his letters when he was talking about how he felt, or when he was showing that he was dedicated to his Lord (also in Romans 1:9; 2 Corinthians 1:23; 1 Thessalonians 2:5, 2:10). You could translate the phrase <em>God is my witness</em> as “God will tell you” or simply as “God knows.” In some translations this phrase is at the end of the verse. See 1:8 in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus:</strong> Just as Jesus cared for the Philippians, so Paul cared for them. He cared so deeply for them that he strongly desired to be with them again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I long for all of you:</strong> This refers mainly to Paul’s desire to see the Philippians again. He wanted to visit them again in order to help them grow in their faith, but this reason is probably not the focus here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the affection of Christ Jesus:</strong> The Greek word <em>splanchna</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>affection</em>, literally means “insides of the body,” that is, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys. Greek people considered that these parts of the body were the source of emotions and feeling. They used <em>splanchna</em> to refer to their emotions, much as English-speaking people use the word “heart.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The entire Greek phrase used here refers to the deep, sincere love that Jesus Christ had for other people. Christ gave Paul the ability to love others in the same way. Therefore, by saying, “I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus,” Paul was saying, “I long for all of you with the love that Jesus Christ has given me.” Another possible translations is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I long for you because Christ Jesus has caused me to love you.</p></blockquote>",

Here in 1:9–11 he told them specifically what he was praying. If in your language it is necessary to translate <em>prayer</em> with a verb, use a verb tense that gives the idea of habitual action in the present: “I pray (regularly, habitually, repeatedly)….”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that your love may abound more and more:</strong> Some languages have a special way to mark the content of a wish or a prayer. For example, in English we use the auxiliary verb <em>may</em>. If you have such a marker, you should use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>love:</strong> The Greek text, like most English translations, does not make it clear whom the Philippians were to love. The text could refer to loving one another or it could refer to loving God. Paul was probably including both ideas. Therefore, if possible you should not say in your translation whom the Philippians were to love. Then your readers will understand that it includes both these ideas. However, if you must provide an object, it is recommended that you say that the Philippians were to love one another.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>abound more and more:</strong> The verb <em>abound</em> here means “grow” or “increase.” In some languages love cannot “grow,” but there may be another idiom for love becoming stronger or more intense. Or, if you cannot use an idiom, you could try expressing this meaning as</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You already love each other a little, now love each other a lot.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used the phrase <em>abound more and more</em> to emphasize that he desired the Philippians’ love to grow.</p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in knowledge and depth of insight,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And I pray</span> that you will know more and more <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of what God is really like</span>, and will be able in every situation to tell the difference <span data-bnType=\"implied\">between what is right and what is wrong</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>knowledge and depth of insight:</strong> Commentators understand this phrase in two main ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>knowledge and depth of insight</em> refers to two things that Paul wanted to see increase along with the Philippians’ love. <em>(GNT, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>The phrase <em>knowledge and depth of insight</em> shows the way in which their love needed to grow, that is, the Philippians were to grow in love that had knowledge and depth of insight. <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, REB, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either interpretation is possible. The Display follows the first interpretation (1). However, if you prefer to follow the second (2), you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>that you will continue loving more and more in a way that is wise and discerning</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>knowledge:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>knowledge</em> is related to a verb that means “to know something truly or completely.” Paul did not specify what sort of knowledge he was talking about. It could refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>understanding God and how he wants us to behave. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that you will fully know and understand how to make the right choices (1:9b-10a, CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>knowledge of the truth in general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>true knowledge (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If you must be explicit, then choose the first option (1), that is, Paul was referring to knowing God and what God wants us to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>depth of insight:</strong> This is literally “all judgment/discernment.” This phrase means to understand all kinds of things in a spiritual sense, to know what is true and right in every situation. This idea continues in 1:10.</p>",

Try to make it clear that the believers are to choose that which is very good.</p><h4>1:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> that you will be free from evil and without blame <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from now</span> until Christ returns.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray this in order</span> that you will be good and innocent people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from now</span> until Christ returns.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> At the beginning of 1:10b there is a Greek word <em>hina</em> that means “that” or “in order that.” The BSB translates this word as <em>and</em>. This is a different Greek word than the Greek phrase <em>eis to</em> at the beginning of 1:10a, which the BSB translates as “so that.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">There are three basic interpretations as to what ideas the author was relating when he used the Greek connecting word <em>hina</em> here at the beginning of 1:10b:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>hina</em> shows the purpose or intended result of the preceding clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will choose what is the right thing to do <u>so that</u> you may be genuinely good and not do anything wrong…” <em>(NJB, NASB, NET, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><em>hina</em> shows another result (besides choosing what is best) of love abounding together with knowledge. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV)</em></p></li><li><p><em>hina</em> shows another thing Paul prayed for. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I pray that you will know more about what God is really like and will be able to tell the difference between right and wrong, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray</span> <u>that</u> you may be genuinely good and not do anything wrong…” <em>(NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pure:</strong> The Greek word translated <em>pure</em> means “separate from evil, innocent, free from wrong.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>blameless:</strong> The Greek word translated <em>blameless</em> means “without offense or guilt.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words that the BSB translates as “pure” and <em>blameless</em> have almost the same meaning. Perhaps “pure” may emphasize <u>internal</u> goodness and purity, and <em>blameless</em> may emphasize <u>outward</u> actions. However, in some languages it may not be possible to use two separate words. If this is true in your language, you could use one term and add a word like “completely” to give extra emphasis. So you could translate this part of the verse as “<u>completely</u> pure” or “<u>completely</u> free from evil.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Greek word <em>eis</em> that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> can have one of two meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Many English translations state that Paul hoped the Philippians would be pure and blameless <u>until</u> Christ returns. These versions tend to use the word “until” or a word with a similar meaning. This also implies that they (and other believers) would continue to be pure and blameless after he returns. <em>(NIV, NASB, GW, NLT, KJV)</em></p></li><li><p>for/on: Paul hoped that the Philippians would be blameless at the time of Christ’s return. These versions tend to use a word such as “for” or “on&quot;. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will be free from all impurity and blame on the Day of Christ (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, RSV, NJB, CEV, NEB, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the day of Christ:</strong> See the note on 1:6b.</p>",

Some translations (for example, GNT) begin a new sentence with this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> you will be filled…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The idea of <em>filled</em> is figurative in this verse. It means “to be characterized by.” You may not be able to keep this figure of speech. Ways to translate this verb nonfiguratively will be discussed after the note on <em>fruit of righteousness</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fruit of righteousness:</strong> The expression <em>fruit of righteousness</em> can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>fruit that consists of righteousness; <em>righteousness</em> is used in an ethical sense and refers to right conduct/behavior. <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>fruit that is produced by righteousness; <em>righteousness</em> is used in a legal sense and refers to a believer’s right standing before God <em>(GW, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:11a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In many languages if the expression “filled with the fruit of righteousness” is translated literally it will not give the correct meaning. If this is true in your language, you should translate this part of the verse nonfiguratively. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>righteousness will characterize all you do</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will behave in a completely righteous manner</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that comes through Jesus Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>through <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the power of</span> Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>because Jesus Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is helping/enabling you,</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through Jesus Christ:</strong> This means that a person’s life is righteous because of the power that Jesus Christ gives. A believer can only be righteous because Jesus Christ helps him to be.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:11a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be better to make Jesus Christ the subject of 1:11a–b.

There are three possible interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It relates to the phrase “filled with the fruit of righteousness.” For example: “I pray that you may be filled with the fruit of righteousness for the glory and praise of God.” <em>(GNT, NLT, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It connects with Paul’s prayer in 1:9a–11b. For example: “I pray that all of this may happen in you for the glory and praise of God.” This seems to be the interpretation of the NIV. <em>(NIV)</em></p></li><li><p>It relates to all of Paul’s thanksgiving and prayer (1:3–11) and is like a doxology. For example: “I end my thanksgiving and prayer with the desire that people glorify and praise God.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not make a clear choice. However, it is recommended that you follow option (1), which has the best support among versions and commentators.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the glory…of God:</strong> This means that the purpose is that people would honor God and tell others that he is great. See “glory&quot;, sense A3 in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to the…praise of God:</strong> This means that the purpose is that people would thank God and speak well of him. Praise comes from those who are grateful that God is great and that he blesses them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to combine the ideas of “glory” and <em>praise</em> into one phrase. Consider how, in your language, you would refer to giving respect to an honored guest, such as a king or a president. Some of those words may be appropriate in this phrase.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase is at the end of Paul’s prayer, and in some languages it is necessary to clearly show where the prayer ends. In English we do this with “Amen.” You may need to end this verse with a phrase like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That is what I am praying for you.</p></blockquote>",

You might translate this as “brothers and sisters,” “older and younger siblings” or “relatives.” But in some languages people use kinship terms only in the literal sense. If this is true in your language, a phrase such as “fellow Christians” or “fellow believers” would be better here. Whatever term you choose should be used consistently throughout the Bible whenever <em>brothers</em> is used to address other Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to put a term of address such as <em>brothers</em> at the beginning of the sentence.

The form of the verb used here means “to be confident” or “to trust.” The BSB translates this same Greek word as “confident” in 1:6 and “trust” in 2:24, and as “convinced” in 1:25. It is recommended that you translate it with a term meaning “have been made confident” or “have been given confidence.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> It is not clear in the Greek text which part of the verse this phrase connects to. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It should be connected to what follows it in the Greek text, that is, the verb that the BSB translates as “confident.” In this case the phrase “confident in the Lord” would mean “the Lord has caused them to be confident.” The brothers were more bold to tell about Christ because of this confidence that the Lord had given them. The majority of commentators support this interpretation. <em>(RSV, GNT, NASB, NET, GW, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It should be connected to what precedes it in the Greek text, that is, “the brothers.” This would then mean “believing brothers” or “Christians.” <em>(NIV, KJV, REB, NLT, CEV, NJB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by my chains:</strong> Paul said that his chains had given the other Christians courage, but he did not say how this was done. He may have meant that they gained courage by seeing the way God had helped him while he was in prison.</p><h4>1:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>now dare more greatly to speak the word without fear.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They have become brave enough to speak the word of God without fear.</p></li><li><p>And they are proclaiming more and more boldly the message that God gave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us<sup>(incl)</sup></span> and are not afraid <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do so</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>more greatly:</strong> In the Greek this is a verb form, literally “much more to dare.” The believers became much bolder/braver than they had been before. They knew some people were against the Christian message. That is why Paul was in prison. But when they saw Paul continue to speak about his Savior even though he was in prison, this increased their courage. If you have a verb meaning “to be brave,” you may use it here. In some languages it will be necessary to use an adjective meaning “bold, courageous” or an adverb meaning “boldly, courageously.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the word:</strong> Some Greek texts have the full phrase “the word of God” and other Greek texts have simply <em>the word</em>. However, these two phrases clearly refer to the same thing, that is, “the message from God.” Therefore, it is recommended that you include the words “of God.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without fear:</strong> This describes the way in which the believers preached. You may need to translate this as a separate sentence at the end of the verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They are not afraid.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to provide an object specifying of whom the brothers were not afraid.

But Paul was still happy because people were telling the good news about Christ.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1051001015\" data-endVerseId=\"1051001018\"><h3>Paragraph 1:15–18d</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Some Christians were jealous of Paul, but this caused them to proclaim the good news more, and so he was rejoicing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">1:15–17 contains a figure of speech called a “chiasmus.” A chiasmus is the ordering of information in a mirror image, like the pattern a-b-b-a. The chiasmus in 1:15–17 refers to two groups of people. The first part of the passage refers to the same people as the fourth part does, and the second part refers to the same people as the third part does. Here is an example using summary statements:</p><p data-indent=\"1\">See “General Comment” on 1:15–17 regarding the possible need to reorder this section in your translation.</p></div><h4>1:15a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Certainly some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> preach about Christ because they envy <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span> and want to appear more important <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than me</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ On the one hand, some <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of these believers</span> proclaim <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the message about</span> Christ because they are jealous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of me</span>, and they want people to follow them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">rather than me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>It is true that:</strong> This translates a Greek particle used at the beginning of a contrast. Another such particle is used in 1:15b for the other half of the contrast (see “but”). Together they mean “on the one hand…on the other hand.” Do not try to translate this statement as referring to the truth of Paul’s words. Instead, use an expression that indicates the first half of a contrast.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry:</strong> Paul referred here and in 1:17 to certain Christians who were causing him trouble. These are probably some of the same people mentioned in 1:15. Apparently they wanted to have more followers than Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>preach Christ:</strong> This means to preach <u>about</u> Christ. Despite their wrong motives these people were believers who were announcing the message about Jesus Christ. Since Paul rejoiced that they were preaching, it appears that what they were saying about Christ was true (1:18d).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>out of:</strong> This means “because of, motivated by” and introduces the reasons why some people were preaching about Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>envy:</strong> This refers to feeling ill-will toward someone because of his good fortune. These people were jealous of what Paul had done and that he had been more successful than they were.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rivalry:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>rivalry</em> refers to the strife that envy causes. These people wanted to gain more disciples than Paul had. They wanted to surpass him and appear to others as more successful and important.</p><h4>1:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but others out of goodwill.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But others <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the believers</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">proclaim the message about Christ</span> intending to help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me spread the gospel</span>.</p></li><li><p>But on the other hand, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some</span> other <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> are preaching with a right attitude.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> This represents the second of two Greek particles that indicate the contrast between the two groups of people. See the “It is true that” note in 1:15a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>out of:</strong> This again means “because of, motivated by.” The reason for their preaching was these believers’ goodwill toward Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>goodwill:</strong> The word <em>goodwill</em> means that these believers liked Paul and wanted to help him spread the gospel. They were preaching with good intentions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way you could translate 1:15b is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Others preach about Christ to help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me and the work of the gospel</span>.</p></blockquote>",

Here Paul meant that these people wanted to be important. They wanted people to respect them and obey them rather than Paul, so they tried to get more people to follow them than Paul had.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not sincerely:</strong> These people preached for the wrong reason, selfishly, for their own advancement rather than for the good of others and the glory of God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It some languages it may be clearer to reverse the ideas of <em>not sincerely</em> and “selfish ambition.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They do not proclaim the message about Christ sincerely, but they preach about him with selfish ambition.</p></blockquote><h4>1:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrongly</span> expect that they will add to the sorrows I am already having here in prison.</p></li><li><p>They intend to increase my problems here in prison.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains:</strong> The Greek literally says “thinking to raise up affliction.” This means that these jealous believers intended to cause trouble for Paul. However, it is implied that what they thought was wrong. Paul continued to rejoice because the gospel was preached.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they can add to the distress of my chains:</strong> This refers not to physical suffering but to inward suffering.

In the BSB it is translated as a rhetorical question implying the answer “It doesn’t really matter.” Paul meant that he was not disturbed and troubled (as his rivals expected he would be) because some believers were preaching the gospel out of envy. Instead, he was just glad that they were preaching the good news.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have rhetorical questions in your language and you can use one here, make sure the answer is clear to the reader.

You could translate the <em>Spirit of Jesus Christ</em> as “the Spirit who comes from Jesus Christ” or as “the Spirit sent by Jesus Christ.”</p><h4>1:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my distress will turn out for my deliverance.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>this will result in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> saving me.</p></li><li><p>the result of what is happening will be that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will rescue me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my distress will turn out for my deliverance:</strong> These words are a quotation from Job 13:16 in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my distress:</strong> The Greek word <em>touto</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>my distress</em>, literally means “this.” Paul probably had the whole situation in mind. “This” refers to what was happening to Paul at the time he was writing the letter, that is, the fact that he was in prison and waiting for a court trial, and also to the fact that people were preaching about Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>will turn out for:</strong> This is an idiom meaning “will lead to” or “will result in.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>my deliverance:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates <em>deliverance</em> is <em>sōtēria</em>, the word often translated “salvation.” So there are two ways to interpret <em>sōtēria</em> here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “salvation.” Paul was saying that the result of what was happening would be that God would save him. Paul would persevere in the faith and would be saved from sin, evil, Satan’s attacks and final spiritual death. Whether he lived or died, the enemies of the gospel would not destroy him. Many commentaries follow this option. <em>(KJV, NJB)</em></p></li><li><p>It means <em>deliverance</em>. Paul was confident that the authorities would release him from prison. So he would be delivered or set free from his imprisonment and would not be put to death (at least at that time). <em>(GNT, RSV, NIV, GW, NET, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) seems to fit better here because of the context of 1:20. Paul was determined to honor Christ, whether it was by the way he lived or the way he died. Paul evidently considered death a genuine possibility, and interpretation (2) does not appear to allow for this. Therefore, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul believed that the result of what was happening to him (being in prison and facing a court trial) would be that God would bring him safely through both life and death to complete salvation in the presence of Jesus.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:19b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be better to reorder 1:19 by putting 1:19c before 1:19b.

You could translate this as “I eagerly and hopefully expect…” <em>(NET, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) has stronger support in commentaries and English versions and is recommended.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eagerly expect:</strong> The Greek term that the BSB translates as <em>eagerly expect</em> can also mean “eagerly desire.” However, most scholars agree that the meaning here is “eagerly expect.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hope:</strong> The word <em>hope</em> here refers not to what Paul wished for but to what he confidently expected.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will in no way be ashamed:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translated as <em>ashamed</em> can mean one of two things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“put to shame, disgraced.” Paul hoped he would not do anything that would bring him into disgrace. He wanted to be approved by God. Specifically, he trusted that he would continue to please God by glorifying Christ. <em>(NASB, GNT, GW, CEV, NCV, REB, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>“feel ashamed.” Paul hoped that he would never be ashamed of Christ and the gospel. He expected that he would continue to be bold in proclaiming the gospel of Christ.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB, NIV, RSV and NET are ambiguous here. But it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul did not want to disappoint God. He trusted God would give him courage to keep on doing what was right (see the rest of 1:20). In this way God would protect him from disgrace.</p><h4>1:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but will have complete boldness</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">want/expect to</span> speak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to the authorities</span> without being at all afraid</p></li><li><p>I want to speak out boldly</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will have complete boldness:</strong> This is literally “in all boldness.” It may be necessary for you to translate <em>boldness</em> or “courage” with a verb or adjective. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>will be brave enough to…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boldness:</strong> Most commentators agree that the <em>boldness</em> Paul was concerned about was the boldness to <u>speak</u> about Christ during his trial. You could translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I will speak boldly/bravely.</p></blockquote><h4>1:20c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:20c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that, as I always have, I will continue to bring honor to Christ by the way I act,</p></li><li><p>so that everything I do will bring glory to Christ, as it always has,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>now as always:</strong> This means that Paul hoped to go on speaking as boldly for Christ as he had in the past.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ will be exalted:</strong> The Greek does not say who would exalt Christ, and there are two ways to understand what Paul was saying here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God, Christ himself, or the Spirit would bring honor to Christ through Paul. People would praise and honor Christ when they saw how Paul served God while he was alive or by the way he died because he believed in Christ. In this way God would glorify Christ through Paul’s body. <em>(REB)</em></p></li><li><p>It was Paul himself who would exalt Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with my whole being I shall bring honor to Christ (GNT) <em>(GW, CEV, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most translations do not explicitly say who would exalt Christ. If you can use the passive (<em>be exalted</em>), that would be appropriate. But if you must use an active verb with an explicit subject, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) along with the majority of commentators and say, “God will exalt Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in my body:</strong> The phrase <em>in my body</em> is a figure of speech meaning “through all I do.” Paul wanted to honor Christ whether he lived or died. In many languages it may not be possible to translate literally and give this meaning.

He was making an emotional statement. He said that he deeply loved Christ and the Philippians. So he wanted very much to be with Christ in heaven, yet he also wanted to be with the Philippian believers on earth. But he knew that he could not do both at the same time. So it was very hard for him to know what would be best.</p><h4>1:22</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The grammar of 1:22 in the Greek is difficult, perhaps because Paul was expressing himself emotionally. The verse has an “if…then” structure, but it is not clear where the “if” clause ends. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The “if” clause covers only the words “if I go on living in the body.” For example: “If I continue to live in the body, then that means fruitful labor for me. I do not know which to choose”. <em>(RSV, NIV, NET, REB, NASB, NLT, NCV, GW)</em></p></li><li><p>The “if” clause also covers the concept of fruitful labor. For example: “If continuing to live means fruitful labor for me, then I do not know which I will choose”. <em>(GNT, NJB, CEV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">The difference in meaning between the two interpretations is actually very small, but the first one is recommended (1).</p><h4>1:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But if I continue to live in this body, I will be able to do productive work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>But if I keep living in this world, I will have useful work to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>living in the body:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translated as <em>body</em> literally means “flesh.” Paul was referring to staying alive on earth in his present physical body. One way to translate this is as “living in this world.” See “flesh&quot;, sense A2 in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fruitful labor:</strong> The Greek is literally “fruit of work” and refers to work that has useful results, work that is productive and worthwhile. Paul was specifically thinking about helping more people to know Christ and helping the Philippians and others to continue growing in grace. Some ways to translate the phrase “fruitful labor for me” are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I can continue to get results from the work I am doing.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will be able to help more people.</p></blockquote><h4>1:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So what shall I choose? I do not know.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But I do not know what I prefer/want, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is, to continue to live or to die</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> Although the BSB translates it as <em>So</em>, the Greek connecting word, <em>kai</em>, means “and, yet, but.” It can show either continuation or contrast. Here it may indicate:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the beginning of a further independent or even contrasting thought. <em>(NIV, RSV, GW, NLT, NCV, REB)</em></p></li><li><p>the continuation of the thought of the earlier part of the verse. <em>(BSB, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the first option (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>what shall I choose:</strong> You could restate this as “Which do I prefer?” Paul was not trying to decide what would happen to him. Only God could do this. Paul was trying to decide which of God’s choices would be better. He explained these two choices further in 1:23–24.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I do not know:</strong> The Greek verb <em>gnōrizō</em> has been interpreted in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “know, perceive.” This is the common meaning in most classical Greek literature. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, NASB, GW, NCV, CEV, NJB, KJV)</em></p></li><li><p>It means “make known, declare, tell.” This is the most common meaning elsewhere in the New Testament, and some commentators say that is what it also means here.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Although RSV and REB translate it as “I cannot tell,” this expression can be an English idiom that means “I do not know” or “I cannot decide.” So it is not possible to be certain which interpretation these two versions follow.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p>",

He was not the one who would decide whether he lived or died. God would decide that. Even the Roman court could only put Paul to death if God permitted it. But Paul had time in prison to think about dying, and here he expressed his deepest feelings about how he loved Christ and wanted to be with him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am torn between the two:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek is “I am constricted/enclosed by the two.” This means that it was hard for Paul to know which of these two things he preferred. The BSB has used an equivalent English idiom to translate this meaning. Another similar idiom is “I am pulled in two directions.” Some languages have idioms with this same meaning, but if you do not have such an idiom, it may be better to say simply:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is hard for me to choose</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I don’t know which would be better.</p></blockquote><h4>1:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I want to leave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">this life</span> and be with Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span>, because that would be much better</p></li><li><p>I want to die and live with Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in heaven</span>, because that would be much better <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than continuing to live on earth</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I desire to depart:</strong> This means “I want to leave this life,” that is, to die. Paul felt that it would be wonderful if he could die and be with Jesus as a result of his trial in the Roman court. There may be some appropriate idiom in your language such as “I want to leave this life.” Or you may need to say simply “I wish to die.” However, make sure that your translation does not imply that Paul was discouraged and tired of living. He was not. He was happy to continue living and serving Christ (as 1:24 makes clear). But he would be even happier to go and be with Christ in heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and be with Christ:</strong> Paul wanted to die in order to go and live with Christ in heaven. In some languages it may be necessary to avoid implying that Christ is dead. If when you test your translation, you discover that people think that Paul meant Christ was dead, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so that I can go and <u>live</u> with Christ in heaven</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which is far better indeed:</strong> The phrase <em>far better indeed</em> shows how deeply Paul felt about this. If in your language you must make explicit what Paul considers dying to be better than, then you could translate it as “much better <span data-bnType=\"implied\">than continuing to live on earth</span>.” If your language does not use comparative expressions like “better” or “better than,” you could perhaps translate this as “which would be extremely good.”</p>",

Their behavior should match their beliefs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>conduct yourselves:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conduct</em> is a verb that literally means “to live as a citizen.” Here it is used figuratively and means “to behave/act.” Some commentators say it implies to live or behave as citizens of heaven or of the kingdom of God. However, you should not put this in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ:</strong> You could translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[act/behave] as you should because you believe the gospel of Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[act/behave] as people who believe the gospel of Christ should act/behave.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the gospel of Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>the gospel of Christ</em> here could mean one of two things.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It could mean “the good news about Christ”. <em>(GW, NLT, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>It could mean “the good news from Christ,” “the good news that Christ gave us.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first meaning is recommended (1).</p><h4>1:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> whether I come and see you or whether I only hear about you while I am away from you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> The Greek word <em>hina</em> that the BSB translates as <em>Then</em> means “in order that” or “so that.” So the following clause gives the purpose of Paul’s instructions in 1:27a. A new sentence could start here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want you to do this in order that…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “this” in the above translation refers to 1:27a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence:</strong> The Greek in this clause is difficult to understand. The two main ways to understand the Greek are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “whether I come and see you, or whether being absent I hear about you.” In this interpretation the phrase <em>only hear about you</em> only goes with the second part of the clause <em>in my absence</em>. This interpretation requires the translator to supply “I will/may know that” in the next clause. <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT, NJB).</em></p></li><li><p>It means “whether I come and see you, or whether I am absent, I will/may hear that…” In this interpretation the phrase <em>only hear about you</em> goes with both <em>I come and see you</em> and <em>in my absence</em> (RSV, GNT, NET, NCV, CEV, KJV, REB, NASB).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul wanted to see the Philippians again, but even if he only heard news about them, he wanted them to be united in believing the good news.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>come:</strong> Some languages use the directions “come” and “go” in different ways from Greek or English. So it may be necessary in these languages to use “go” or “return” here instead of <em>come</em>. Use the verb that is most natural for your language.</p><h4>1:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I will know that you stand firm in one spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that I will know that you are standing firm, united <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against all who oppose you</span>.</p></li><li><p>so that I will know that you are united together.</p></li></ul></div><h4>1:27d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>contending side by side</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will know that you are</span> all struggling together <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against those who oppose the gospel</span></p></li></ul></div><h4>1:27c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will know:</strong> This phrase is not in the Greek, but has been supplied in the BSB to make a natural English sentence.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>stand firm:</strong> The Greek word translated by the BSB as <em>stand firm</em> literally just means “stand.” It is used figuratively here to mean “be steadfast.” Paul wanted the Philippians to be strong in their faith and not let others change their minds about trusting Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in one spirit, contending side by side:</strong> The phrases <em>in one spirit</em> and <em>side by side</em> are not expressing different ideas. They both emphasize unity. It is important to get the meaning of unity in your translation. Possible phrases are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with one common purpose</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>with one heart<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A few say the phrase “in one spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit, but there is little support for this view.</span></span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not divided</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>contending:</strong> The Greek here refers to striving or struggling together against a common enemy. Be careful that in your translation the word <em>contending</em> does not imply that the believers were to fight against each other. Paul did not say specify against whom the Philippians were to contend. It is, however, clear from the rest of the letter that people in Philippi, perhaps Jews, were opposing them. Do not try to specify who these enemies were unless it is necessary to do so in your language. If you do need to say something, you should use a general expression, for example, “against those who oppose the gospel.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Obviously Paul did not mean that he wanted to hear that the Philippians were fighting people physically for the gospel. So avoid using a verb which would only refer to hitting or shooting someone. Here he was referring to speaking very strongly or very emotionally to another, or acting in a strong way but without physical fighting. See the note on 4:3b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>side by side:</strong> The Greek here is literally “with one soul.” Many translations understand this to refer to the way people think and translate this as “with one mind” (RSV, NET, KJV, NASB, REB).</p><h4>1:27e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:27e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the faith of the gospel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to defend what the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span> teaches.</p></li><li><p>to promote what the gospel tells <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us<sup>(incl)</sup></span> about all that Christians believe.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the faith of the gospel:</strong> This phrase appears only here in the New Testament. Paul urged the Philippians believers to energetically defend and proclaim the faith that the good news has brought them. They are to struggle for the sake of maintaining and preserving that faith.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> The Greek word <em>pistis</em>, <em>faith</em>, refers here to the things that Christians believe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gospel:</strong> The <em>gospel</em> is the source or origin of that faith. The faith of Christians is based on the good news about Jesus Christ. See “gospel&quot; in KBT.</p>",

The believers were not afraid to be faithful to God even though they suffered. This fearlessness was a sign that God controlled their lives and therefore that those who opposed the believers were opposing God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their destruction:</strong> This implies that God would eternally destroy them.

It means that they would not live eternally with God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of your salvation:</strong> This implies that God would give the Philippians eternal life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be more natural in your language to reverse these last two clauses.

It gives the reason for what Paul had just been saying there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it has been granted to you:</strong> Commentators agree that the word <em>granted</em> implies that God had given the Philippian believers a special privilege or favor. God was being good to them by allowing them to suffer for Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages have different words for giving gifts and giving privileges. The choice of words may also depend on how the status (or importance) of the one who gives relates to the status of the one who receives. Consider how your people view the status of God in relation to the status of people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on behalf of Christ:</strong> The phrase <em>on behalf of Christ</em> may relate to 1:29 in three ways. Therefore, there are three possible interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase relates primarily to the word “suffer.” This can be expressed, for example, as “It has been granted to you to <u>suffer</u> for Christ, not only to believe in him.” Many commentators hold this view.</p></li><li><p>The phrase relates to both “believe” and “suffer.” This can be expressed, for example, as “It has been granted to you to <u>believe</u> in Christ and to <u>suffer</u> for him.” This is very close in meaning to the first interpretation. In fact, it is not possible to know which of these views a number of English versions follow. <em>(GW, CEV, REB, NET, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>The phrase relates to the phrase “it has been granted to you.” This can be expressed, for example. as “For Christ’s sake <u>this has been granted to you</u>: to believe in him and to suffer for him.” <em>(NIV, RSV, KJV, NASB, NCV, NJB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first interpretation is recommended (1), but in translation there may be no difference between that and the second.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>believe in Him:</strong> This means the same as “believe on him” or “put your trust in him.” You could also translate it as “trust him” or “believe what he says.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>suffer for Him:</strong> The phrase <em>suffer for Him</em> means that a person is persecuted because he believes in Christ. It means to experience pain (physical or emotional) for Christ’s sake.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is possible to rephrase the whole sentence (1:29) as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God not only has allowed you to believe in Christ but also has given you the privilege of suffering for Christ.</p></blockquote>",

Since they lived among many people who were opposed to the gospel, they should expect to defend their faith.

In your translation you may need to divide this into several shorter sentences.</p></div><h4>2:1</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">There is no verb in 2:1 in the Greek text. BSB has supplied “have” in the first phrase, but you may need to supply a verb for each of the four parts of the verse. Paul used these four conditional or “if” clauses (or phrases) to make his appeal to the Philippians very strong. What he was asking them to do is in 2:2a: “make my joy complete.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul used the Greek word <em>ei</em> in each of the four parts of 2:1. It literally means “if.” But in this context Paul was not expressing any doubt that these things were true. He was assuming that they were true. If your word for “if” is only used in a conditional sense, you will need to use another connecting word here, for example, “since.” See the first Meaning Line in the Display for 2:1a, 2:1b, 2:1c, and 2:1d.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">These four phrases have a strong emotional effect, and Paul’s basic aim in writing them was to motivate the readers to follow his instructions in 2:2–4. Look for a way in your language to express the emotional appeal and the strong feeling that Paul showed here. Try not to lose the emotional force by making long sentences in an attempt to explain the exact meaning. One possibility is to use rhetorical questions. For example, in 2:1a:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Does being united to Christ encourage you? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Of course it does!</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you use rhetorical questions, you will need to use them in each part of this verse. See the second Meaning Line in the Display for 2:1a, 2:1b, 2:1c, and 2:1d.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Another way to translate 2:1 is to use short statements. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>1</sup>You are united to Christ and this encourages you. Christ loves you and this gives you comfort. You have fellowship with the Spirit. And there is tenderness and compassion.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you do this, you will need to begin 2:2 with a phrase to connect it with all these statements in 2:1. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2</sup>Since all these things are true, make my joy complete….</p></blockquote><h4>2:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore if you have any encouragement in Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Since/if you are encouraged because you belong to Christ,</p></li><li><p>¶ Does it encourage you that you belong to Christ? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Of course it does!</span></p></li><li><p>¶ You live in union with Christ and he/this encourages you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates literally as <em>Therefore</em> indicates that what follows is the result of what preceded. Some English versions do not use a connector here. Use the expression that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if you have any encouragement in Christ:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek here is “If any encouragement in Christ…” But in many languages, a verb will be needed (as it is in English). The context implies <em>you have</em> (as the BSB uses) or “you receive” here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>encouragement:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>encouragement</em> comes from a verb that means “to comfort, encourage, cheer up.” It is not possible to translate <em>encouragement</em> as a noun in every language. If you need to translate it with a verb, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if you are encouraged/comforted because you are united with Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if being united with Christ encourages/comforts you</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>if Christ has encouraged you by uniting you with himself</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ:</strong> The BSB translates the Greek phrase literally as <em>in Christ</em>. People who are joined with Christ because they trust him are <em>in Christ</em>. They belong to him, they let him have control of their lives.</p><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if any comfort from His love,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>since/if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> are comforted by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ’s</span> love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for you</span>,</p></li><li><p>Do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> get any comfort <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from knowing</span> that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> loves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you? Yes, you do!</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> loves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> and this comforts you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>comfort from His love:</strong> In Greek, the noun <em>love</em> has no possessive pronoun (<em>His</em>). This means that commentators disagree about what love Paul was talking about here. There are four main possibilities:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another possibility is that it refers to God’s love for the Philippians. Some commentators suggest this so that this would then complete the Trinity in 2:1. That is: 2:1a—Christ encourages, 2:1b—God loves, and 2:1c—the Spirit provides fellowship.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Christ’s love for the Philippians.</p></li><li><p>Paul’s love for the Philippians.</p></li><li><p>The Philippians’ love for Paul.</p></li><li><p>The Philippians’ love for one another.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions do not make it clear what love is being referred to (for example, RSV, NJB, NASB), but those which do make it clear, follow the first option—Christ’s love for the Philippians (BSB, NIV, GNT, NLT, CEV, NCV). Since the exact meaning of the Greek is not clear, it may be preferable to leave it more general in your translation, if you can do so. However, if in your language you must provide a subject and an object for <em>love</em>, it is recommended that you also follow option (1). Believers do not have to worry even in difficult times because they know that Christ loves them.</p><h4>2:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if any fellowship with the Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>since/if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> have fellowship with the Spirit,</p></li><li><p>Do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> share together with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> Spirit? <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yes, of course!</span></p></li><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit shares together with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fellowship with the Spirit:</strong> The Greek is literally “fellowship of the spirit.” This may refer to</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the fellowship that believers have with the Spirit. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, GNT)</em></p></li><li><p>the fellowship that the Spirit helps believers to have with each other. <em>(CEV, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fellowship:</strong> The Greek word here is <em>koinōnia</em>, which means “sharing,” “participating,” “having a part in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">something</span>.” This Greek word has several related meanings. For example, it can refer to people sharing with one another or doing something with one another, or people joining together with others in some way. The sense in this verse has to do with participation in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit dwells within and ministers to all believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> Most commentators and versions agree that this refers to the Spirit of God. You may need to translate the phrase <em>the Spirit</em> as “the Holy Spirit” or “the Spirit of God” or “God’s Spirit” in order to make it clear to whom it is referring.</p><h4>2:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if any affection and compassion,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and since/if <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> has been tender and compassionate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">toward you</span>,</p></li><li><p>Has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> been kind and merciful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">toward you? Of course he has!</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> has been kind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span> and has shown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> pity.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>affection and compassion:</strong> These two words can refer to two different feelings or to a way of expressing a single emotion. Most commentaries interpret the two words as two distinct but related ideas. The phrase <em>affection and compassion</em> has been understood as describing</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>how Christ felt toward the Philippians (SSA, O’Brien);</p></li><li><p>how the Philippians felt toward one another or toward Paul. <em>(GNT, REB, GW, NLT, CEV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If you need to translate <em>affection and compassion</em> as verbs, you will probably need to give a subject. Interpretation (1) is the most likely to be what Paul meant, and it is recommended that you follow it. Christ loved the Philippians and pitied them. He demonstrated this when he died on the cross to save them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>affection:</strong> This is the same word as was used in 1:8. The Greek word literally refers to the “insides of the body.” It means the “affections,” “the feelings of the heart,” “the center of a person’s emotions.” In this verse it means to be tender toward someone, to be kind and gentle to them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>compassion:</strong> The Greek word here means “pity, mercy, sympathy.”</p>",

For example, “trying to make yourself [or yourselves] seem more important than others.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>empty pride:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>empty pride</em> can also be translated as “conceit” or “vanity.” A person who has <em>empty pride</em> is one who is proud and who boasts. He praises himself and thinks that his ideas are always the best.</p><h4>2:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in humility consider others more important than yourselves.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, be humble and think of others as more important than yourselves.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>humility:</strong> The word <em>humility</em> is the opposite of “selfish ambition” and “empty pride” in 2:3a. The Greek word refers to someone who has the characteristics of meekness or lowliness. If you need to translate this as a verb, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>act as if you were not important</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>submit yourselves to others</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>consider others more important than yourselves:</strong> A believer should not think of himself as more important than or superior to others, as some in Philippi may have been doing. Each believer should think of other people as more important than himself. This is another way of saying “be humble.” Another way to say this could be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>give more honor to others than you give to yourselves</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:3</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reverse this sentence in order to make the negative command “Do nothing” into a positive command “Do everything.” A suggested model is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do everything in humility and by considering others better than yourselves.

Some recent commentaries have arguments for an interpretation which is slightly different: “Have this attitude among you, which is appropriate for those who are in Christ Jesus” (interpretation 2 in the Notes). The traditional interpretation says that the implied verb or action (was) allows for the following meaning: “have this attitude which Christ Jesus had” (interpretation 1 in the Notes). Interpretation 2 says that the literal phrase “in Christ Jesus” means “in union with Christ Jesus.” This could imply that it has the same meaning in 2:5 that it has in many other places, including several places in Philippians (1:1, 1:13; 2:1; 3:14; 4:7).The interpretation of this verse does not affect the overall meaning or theme of the paragraph. However, this is a popular passage and people often memorize it. So if you change the traditional rendering, some readers may think that you have translated it badly. Therefore, before you translate, consider how you can make the best translation and still have the people accept it.</span></span> <em>(RSV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The following verses (2:6–11) describe the attitude that Christ Jesus had.

A person with a proud attitude is someone who thinks that he is more important than others. Someone with a humble attitude is one who does not think proudly about himself. Instead, he thinks about how important others are. 2:6–8 show that Jesus’ attitude was humble.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> See note on 1:1a.</p>",

Paul then used it at this point because it was appropriate to his message. Or Paul may have composed it himself when he wrote this letter to the Philippians. Try to translate these verses not as a prose description but as a hymn or as a poem. Some of the English versions print these verses in lines like a poem (BSB, NIV, GNT). If you have a special way of printing poetry in your language, you could use it here.</p><h4>2:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Who, existing in the form of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Even though</span> he had the same nature as God,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Although</span> he was like God in every way,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>existing in the form of God:</strong> This could be literally translated as “being in the form of God.” The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>form</em> is <em>morphē</em>. It refers to a form that accurately reflects the essential qualities of someone or something. Christ has always had the same nature as God (see the GNT).</p><h4>2:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>he did not think that he should <span data-bnType=\"implied\">try to</span> hold onto his equal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">place/position</span> with God.</p></li><li><p>he did not insist on keeping <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all the power and privileges of</span> being equal with God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>did not consider equality with God something to be grasped:</strong> There are two main ways to understand this clause. The difference is in the interpretation of the rare Greek word <em>harpagmos</em> that the BSB translates as <em>something to be grasped</em>.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word <em>harpagmos</em> refers to a person holding on to something he already has. This would mean that, before he was born as a human, Christ was equal with God. But in order to become man, he did not try to hold on to the privileges that came with being equal with God. He was willing to give them up. This is probably the most common interpretation of 2:6b. <em>(GNT, NLT, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>The word <em>harpagmos</em> refers to a person snatching or taking by force something he does not yet have. This interpretation would mean that Jesus as a man was not equal with God, but he did not use force to try and become equal with God while he was a man.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English translations, like the BSB, are ambiguous, though they most likely follow the first interpretation. The context of 2:6 is Christ’s <u>preparation</u> for becoming man. So interpretation (1) fits better with this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to use a direct quote here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He didn’t say, “I must hold on to my equal status with God.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to make it clear in your translation that this was the attitude that Jesus Christ had.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>equality with God:</strong> This means “being equal with God” or “having the same power and privileges that God has.” It probably refers to outward status and the display of greatness. When he became man, Christ remained truly God, but he gave up the outward display of his power and glory.</p>",

Jesus was and is the supreme example of being humble and considering the needs of others more than his own.</p></div><h4>2:7–8</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">There are six verbs in 2:7–8 (underlined below). These verbs can relate to each other in several ways. This is how they would appear in a literal translation of the Greek:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>He <u>emptied</u> himself,</p></li><li><p><u>taking</u> the form of a slave,</p></li><li><p><u>being born</u> in the likeness of men,</p></li><li><p><u>being found</u> in form as a man,</p></li><li><p>he <u>humbled</u> himself,</p></li><li><p><u>becoming obedient</u> unto death.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">(a) and (e) are the main verbs and the others depend on these two. The second meaning line in the Display arranges this passage in two sentences: A-B-C (2:7) and D-E-F (2:8), with the second sentence following chronologically after the first. First Christ humbled himself by becoming like a slave (that is, he became a man), and then he humbled himself further by dying.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some translations have divided this into three sentences, A-B, C-D and E-F. Look at the GNT for one example of this.</p><h4>2:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but emptied Himself,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, he left everything behind,</p></li><li><p>Rather he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">willingly</span> gave up <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his privileges as God and came to earth</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>emptied Himself:</strong> The BSB translates the Greek literally as <em>emptied Himself</em>. It means he humbled himself. Christ was still truly God in his character, attributes and nature. But he willingly gave up the power and privileges that were rightfully his and completely humbled himself in order to become human.</p><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>taking the form of a servant,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>accepting the same nature as a slave,</p></li><li><p>and he became the same as a slave,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>taking the form of a servant:</strong> As Christ before his incarnation was truly God, now he became truly man as well. He took the form of a servant, that is, he became the same as a servant. This includes the implied meaning “he came to earth.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He <span data-bnType=\"implied\">came to earth and</span> became the same as a servant/slave.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>form:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>form</em> is <em>morphē</em>, the same Greek word that Paul used in 2:6a when referring to Christ having the same nature as God. See the note there. When Jesus became a man, he submitted himself to other people and experienced pain, hunger and thirst. If in your translation you can use the same word to speak about Jesus being in the form of God and Jesus taking the form of a servant, you should do so. However, if it is not possible to use the same word, try to still keep the parallelism in some way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>servant:</strong> See note on “servants” in 1:1a. Look for the word or phrase in your language that implies the lowest social position or the position of a servant. Jesus, who had had all the rights and privileges of God himself, now voluntarily becomes someone with no rights at all.</p><h4>2:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>being made in human likeness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that is, he became a human being.</p></li><li><p>by being born as a human being.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">The Display shows how the clause in 2:7b relates to the previous clause in 2:7a. It shows how Jesus took the form of a slave.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>being made:</strong> This means “becoming” or “being born.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in human likeness:</strong> A literal translation is “in the likeness of human beings.” Some English versions translate as “man” the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>human</em>. But the Greek word used here does not mean “male.” It refers to a human being of either sex.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your translation should not imply that Christ was <u>like</u> humans but not really human. So you may need to translate the phrase “being made in human likeness” as, for example, “he became a human being.”</p>",

It means that people could see that he looked like a man.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>appearance:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>appearance</em> refers to the outward or external shape of something.

They should also expect to suffer because they trusted in Christ.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1051002009\" data-endVerseId=\"1051002011\"><h3>Paragraph 2:9–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">After Christ had obediently humbled himself, God exalted Christ and gave him the highest possible honor and authority. By using this example, Paul implied that God would also honor those of his people who obediently humbled themselves.</p></div><h4>2:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So God raised him to the position above everything</p></li><li><p>Because of this God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">after causing Jesus to live again</span> lifted him to the place/position of highest possible honor.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> In 2:6–8 Christ humbled himself. In 2:9–11 God exalted him. So the main connection between 2:6–8 and 2:9–11 is that 2:9–11 is the result of 2:6–8: Christ obediently humbled himself, and <u>as a result</u> God exalted him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, a literal translation of the Greek here is “therefore also.” This is an unusual combination of Greek words that shows that there is also a contrast between 2:6–8 and 2:9–11. This contrast is highly dramatic. Look for a way to make this contrast exciting in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God exalted Him to the highest place:</strong> God gave Jesus the highest honor he could give anyone. He gave him the position of the greatest possible honor and authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The speakers of some languages have incorrectly imagined that God put Jesus’ dead body in an important position. If the readers of your translation might think this, you will need to make explicit the information that God first caused Jesus to live again. See the Display on 2:9b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Look for an expression in your language that indicates the greatest possible honor. Other translation ideas are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God gave him greatness beyond measure.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God made him very, very great.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to show who or what Jesus is greater than. (2:9b and 2:10 indicate this.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God made him greater than everything and everyone.</p></blockquote><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and gave Him the name above all names,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>by giving him the name that has greater honor and authority than all other names.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is</span> he gave him the title/rank <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of lordship</span> that is greater than any other title/rank.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and gave Him the name above all names:</strong> God gave Jesus the name that has greater honor and authority than all other names. God gave him a title or rank that is greater than that of anyone or anything else. He made him to be Lord of all.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>name:</strong> This may refer to a specific name or to the reputation or rank that God gave Jesus.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are several interpretations of what the word “name” here refers to:(1) Lord (see 2:11)(2) Not a literal name, but his rank and position (Banker)(3) Jesus (see 2:10)(4) Jesus Christ (see 2:11)Most commentators understand that the “name” Paul is referring to here is “Lord.” “Lord,” <em>kurios</em>, was used in the Septuagint as a substitute for the personal name of God, Yahweh, which was considered too holy to be spoken. Thus Jesus may be here identified with Yahweh. This may be implied by the fact that the OT quote in Philippians 2:10–11 is from Isaiah 45:23. In the context of Isaiah 45:21–24, God referred to himself as Yahweh, which is translated “Lord” in English.</span></span> But even if <em>name</em> refers to a specific or literal name, the idea of rank or position is also included. See Romans 1:5; 1 Timothy 6:1 and Hebrews 1:4 for other examples of the word <em>name</em>. The position God gave to Jesus was one of lordship, authority, power and dignity.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a person’s <em>name</em> is not associated with his position or authority. If this is so in your language, you will need to make this clear in another way. See the second Meaning Line in the Display on 2:9b for another suggestion.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:9</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There are two ways to understand how the two clauses in 2:9 (“God exalted Him…and gave Him the name”) relate to each other:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>God exalted Jesus to the highest place, <u>that is</u>, he gave him the name that is above every name (see SSA). This also has good support in the commentaries. One way to translate this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God exalted him by giving him the greatest name. <em>(GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>God exalted Jesus to the highest place, <u>and</u> he <u>also</u> gave him the name that is above every name. “Exalting” and “giving a name” are thus two separate things God did for Jesus. This is not stated explicitly in most translations but is the natural reading. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, REB, NET, NLT and CEV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is likely that the two actions in 2:9 are two ways of speaking about the same thing. So interpretation (1) is preferred here.</p></div>",

God gave Christ the highest authority <u>in order that</u> every knee should bow to him. 2:10–11 shows the purpose for 2:9. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NET, GW)</em></p></li><li><p>It indicates result. God gave Christ the highest authority <u>with the result that</u> every knee will bow. <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) has much stronger commentary support, and it is recommended that you follow it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at the name of Jesus every knee should bow:</strong> The name <em>Jesus</em> refers to the person Jesus, who is Christ, the Lord of lords and the King of kings. God desires that everyone should acknowledge that Jesus is Lord of all.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>at the name of Jesus:</strong> There are at least three ways to interpret this expression. These interpretations depend on two things:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>what the Greek word <em>en</em> means (translated as <em>at</em> in the BSB);</p></li><li><p>whether Paul was referring to the literal name <em>Jesus</em> here, or to the person that the name represents, or to both.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The three main interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase means “in honor of Jesus.” People should bow to honor the person Jesus. Jesus himself is the one to whom they show respect.</p></li><li><p>The phrase means “at the name of Jesus.” When people hear the name <em>Jesus</em> they should bow, because they will know whom it represents.</p></li><li><p>The phrase means “in the name of Jesus.” People should bow and worship in Jesus’ name on the basis of all that his name implies: he is the person God has exalted above all others.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The phrase <em>the name of Jesus</em> is probably a figure of speech referring to Jesus himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>every knee should bow:</strong> This is a Hebrew way of saying that everyone should kneel down. It implies that they bow to show that they are submitting to someone or worshiping someone.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>every knee:</strong> This refers to all people and all beings capable of bowing to someone. God’s desire is that all people willingly bow and submit to Jesus. But willing or not, one day <u>everyone</u> will submit to Jesus. The knee that bows represents the person who submits himself, his whole person, to a greater authority.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>should bow:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>should bow</em> is a form of the Greek word which shows purpose. In this context God is the one whose purpose it is that all should bow. So it is certain that it will happen.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Old Testament culture, the act of kneeling implied that a person especially needed something or was showing a very humble and respectful attitude. However, in some cultures people do not kneel to show respect. So in some languages it is necessary to say “humble themselves” instead of the literal <em>bow</em> or kneel. In other languages it is necessary to include both the action and the attitude. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>kneel down to show respect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are two ways to translate this entire clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God did this so that everybody will show respect to Jesus.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God did this so that every person will humble himself before Jesus.</p></blockquote><h4>2:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">whether they are</span> in heaven or on earth or under <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the surface of</span> the earth.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">including those</span> in heaven, those on earth, and those in the world of the dead.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in heaven:</strong> The literal Greek here means “of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those</span> in heaven.” The Greek does not say what kind of beings or creatures. The phrase most likely refers to angels and possibly to people who have died and gone to heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on earth:</strong> The phrase <em>on earth</em> means “of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those</span>] on earth.” This refers mainly to people on earth. But some commentators include also animals and other living things, and evil spirits who have authority in the world.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>under the earth:</strong> This phrase means “of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those</span> under the earth.” There are many different suggestions about what this refers to. The most widely supported view is that it refers to people who have died. It may include evil spirits.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Other views are: Some say the phrase “under the earth” refers to all dead people, including both the good and the bad. Others say that the phrases “in heaven…on earth…under the earth” represent all spiritual beings, including humans. A few say that these phrases should not be limited to living things, but that all that God has created will acknowledge that Jesus is Lord. This includes things that have life and things that do not have life.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This third phrase <em>under the earth</em> is probably the hardest of the three phrases in 2:10b to translate. In some cultures a literal translation is meaningless. Possible translations are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those in the deep places of the earth</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who are dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spirits of dead people</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:10b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The three groups of beings listed in 2:10b clearly are intended to cover all beings everywhere that God has created. The point is to make it clear that <u>all creatures everywhere</u> will submit to Jesus Christ, not to describe the three different groups in detail. One possible way of making this clear would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All created beings, whether in heaven, on the earth or beneath the earth.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:10</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">It will not be grammatically possible in all languages to end a sentence with a list, as in 2:10b. So it may be necessary to move 2:10b to the middle or the beginning of 2:10a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…so that at the name of Jesus everybody—in heaven and on earth and under the earth—will kneel</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…so that all beings in the heavens, on earth and in the underworld, should bend the knee at the name of Jesus. (JB)</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:10</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Remember that this is a kind of poetry in Greek and is rich in word pictures (knee, tongue, earth, heaven). Try to keep as many of these word pictures as you can, but be sure the meaning remains the same.</p></div>",

One way to translate this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“So then, dear friends, since you always obeyed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> when I was with you, it is even more important that you continue to obey now, while I am not with you.

(JBP) <em>(NLT, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) has stronger support from the commentaries and seems to be preferable in this context. It is therefore recommended that you follow it.</p><h4>2:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>continue to strive with fear and trembling to complete your salvation</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">each of</span> you should reverently <span data-bnType=\"implied\">strive to</span> completely do those things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which are right/appropriate for people whom God</span> has saved.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>continue to work out your salvation:</strong> There are two interpretations of this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Each believer had an individual responsibility to work out the salvation that he had already received.</p></li><li><p>The believers were responsible to work out their salvation as a community.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) has stronger support. This does not mean that the Philippians should save themselves. They should live in a way that showed to others that God had already saved them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure you make the verb you use here a command and make it clear that it is the main verb in this verse. This is important because 2:13 relates back to this command.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your salvation:</strong> Three passages in Philippians (1:6; 2:12; 3:7–14) show how Paul understood the way God saves people and what their responsibility is. In this verse, <em>salvation</em> includes the whole process of salvation. It starts with God bringing people to repent and believe, continues with him making them holy, and will conclude when he brings them to heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be possible to translate this whole phrase as “Work hard so your salvation will be complete.” But in some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>salvation</em> as a verb. The second Meaning Line in the Display shows a way to do this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with fear and trembling:</strong> This phrase is not talking about two separate things. The <em>trembling</em> is a sign of the <em>fear</em>. Using <em>trembling</em> as a verb, the phrase could be translated as “trembling with/from fear.” This means that all believers should be afraid of sinning. They should fear that they might disobey God and fail him. This phrase also suggests that they should revere God and highly respect him.</p>",

This was <u>in order that</u> they could become blameless. 2:15 gives the purpose for 2:14.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>blameless:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>blameless</em> means to behave in such a way that a person cannot be criticized for doing wrong. Paul said that the Philippians should behave in such a way that people could not call them evildoers. A common English expression for <em>blameless</em> is “no one can find fault with you.” Some people might still try to say the Philippian believers had done wrong, but if the believers were blameless, no one could criticize them honestly or justly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pure:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>pure</em> means “sincere, upright.” It means that a person does not intend to do evil.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:15a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The words “blameless” and “pure” mean almost the same thing and are intended to strengthen each other. If you do not have two words similar in meaning in your language, then use one word or phrase and add extra emphasis. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>truly righteous</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is,</span> you will be God’s children having done nothing wrong in the midst of people who are very evil and who habitually do what is bad.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is,</span> as God’s children, you may live in a way that is completely good among people who are completely evil.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without fault:</strong> The Greek literally means “without blemish.” This term was used to describe the sort of animals the priests were commanded to offer as sacrifices to God in the temple in Jerusalem. These animals could not have anything wrong with them or any ugly marks on them. Here the term is used figuratively and means for a person to have nothing morally wrong with him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>without fault</em> here and “blameless” in 2:15a are different, but they have almost exactly the same meaning. Some translators have omitted the phrase <em>without fault</em> because it is awkward to repeat the same idea. But it is better to try to show Paul’s emphasis on the fact that God’s children should be morally upright. One way to do this is to translate the phrase “children of God without fault” using a word such as “perfect”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s perfect children (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>perfect children of God (JB)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>crooked and perverse generation:</strong> This refers to people who did evil continually. The two words <em>crooked</em> and <em>perverse</em> mean basically the same thing. Together they can mean “very evil.” Paul may have quoted this whole phrase from the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 32:5). Here he used it to refer to the non-Christians around the Philippian believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>crooked:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crooked</em> literally means “twisted, bent.” Here it is used figuratively to refer to people who are crooked, unjust, or dishonest in their behavior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>perverse:</strong> This is very similar in meaning to “crooked.” The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>perverse</em> literally means “distorted.” It is used figuratively to mean “perverted, corrupt.” Here it refers to people who are evil, those who are morally corrupt.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>generation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>generation</em> normally refers to people who are alive at the same time. It can also refer to a group of people who all have the same character. In 2:15b <em>generation</em> refers particularly to those who did not believe or obey the good news.</p><h4>2:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in which you shine as lights in the world</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You must <span data-bnType=\"implied\">behave well</span> among them like lights shining in a dark world.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Behave</span> among those people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in a way that contrasts with their evil behavior</span> like stars that shine in the dark sky.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in which you shine as lights in the world:</strong> This simile compares Christian believers to stars shining in the dark sky at night. They should be good people living for God in a world of evil people. This is a figure of speech comparing good behavior to light and evil to darkness. Jesus also used this comparison (Matthew 5:14–16).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If this is not a common way of speaking in your language, then you may need to make the points of comparison clear. Or you may need to avoid the metaphor altogether. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The way you act should be very different from the way evil people act.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>shine:</strong> The word <em>shine</em> means “give light.” This is a metaphor for Christians displaying God’s truth and goodness by the way they behave. The form of the verb here can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a command. Paul was telling the Philippian believers how they were to behave, that is, they were to “shine like stars”. <em>(GNT, NLT, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>It is a statement. It refers to what the Philippians were already doing. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You shine among them like stars <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NET, REB, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The context, especially 2:16b, seems to imply a command rather than simply a statement. However, if you wish to follow interpretation (2), you could translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You give/shed light among them like stars give light in the sky.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>lights:</strong> The Greek word can refer to</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“heavenly lights, bodies, stars”; <em>(NIV, GNT, NCV, GW, REB, NJB)</em></p></li><li><p>“lights” in general or “objects that shine.” This could include lamps and beacons as well as the sun and the moon and the stars. <em>(BSB, NET, RSV, CEV, NASB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow the majority of translations and commentaries and translate this as “stars.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>world:</strong> The Greek word <em>kosmos</em> means “the physical universe” or “the world [of people].” If you follow interpretation (1) above and use “stars” rather than “lights,” you should translate this as referring to the physical universe.</p>",

Two ways to show how this clause joins to 2:16a could be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Do this</span> so that I can be proud.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you do this</span> then I can boast.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boast:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>boast</em> here means “to be proud of someone or something” or “to be very happy and confident about something or someone.” This Greek word occurs also in 1:26, where the BSB translates it as “exultation,” and in its root form in 3:3, where the BSB translates it as “glory.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages may have more than one word for <em>boast</em>. People may use a different word depending on whether they think boasting is a good thing or a bad thing to do. For example, in English, the word <em>boast</em> usually has a negative meaning, but the phrase “be proud of” is more positive. Paul obviously felt that it was good for him to <em>boast</em> here. Therefore, if your language has more than one word for boasting, choose the one with the positive meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the day of Christ:</strong> See note on 1:6b.</p><h4>2:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that I did not run or labor in vain.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it will be clear that</span> all my efforts and my hard work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you</span> have not been wasted.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want to rejoice</span> that the way I made a great effort and worked hard <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among you</span> brought good results.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul told here what he would boast about. If the Philippian believers remained faithful to God, he would be able to boast that his work among them had made a difference in how they thought and acted. In some languages the translator may need to use a direct quote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will not have to say, “I taught them in vain.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that I did not run or labor in vain:</strong> Paul meant that he would be proud that his hard work had proved useful or profitable.

Paul was using the metaphor of a person running a race in order to receive a prize (see also Hebrews 12:1 and Philippians 3:12–14). He meant making great efforts to faithfully teach the good news. Paul would be proud when he knew that the ones he taught had been faithful to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>labor:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>labor</em> means “to work hard, toil.” It implies that Paul struggled and suffered and became weary while he was taking the gospel to the Philippians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in vain:</strong> The phrase <em>in vain</em> means “in vain, with no good results.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:16c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that Paul used two negatives in the same phrase (“not…in vain”).

The main clause in 2:17 (“I am glad and rejoice with all of you”) agrees with what the author said or implied in 2:16. It does not indicate a contrast to 2:16. Many commentaries support this interpretation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, Gordon Fee. Also Tony Popr in personal correspondence with the author.</span></span> <em>(KJV, NJB)</em></p></li><li><p>The word <em>alla</em> means “but,” showing a contrast to the text preceding 2:17. <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, NLT, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you translate 2:17 as a continuation of rather than a contrast to 2:16. This may mean that you do not need to translate <em>alla</em> explicitly. Many English translations have left it implicit, as English does not always need a conjunction to indicate a further thought. Or you may need to use a “Yes” or a “No” at the beginning of 2:17 in your translation. This will depend on what part of 2:16 the main idea of 2:17 is adding to and agreeing with. The NJB uses “indeed” to indicate how the two verses relate.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith:</strong> Here Paul used a figure of speech to describe his situation. He referred to two different kinds of offerings. The Jewish priests killed animals on the altar as sacrifices. To accompany this they also poured wine out on the ground or on the dead animal (Numbers 15:1–12). This was called a drink offering. Paul compared the Philippians to the animal <em>sacrifice</em>, and he compared himself to the <em>drink offering</em> that completed their sacrifice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Unbelievers were persecuting the Philippians because they chose to worship God and obey the good news of Jesus Christ. So their lives were like a sacrifice offered to God. Paul was suffering in prison and was in danger of death because he had preached the good news to many people. So he was like the drink offering that the priest poured on top of another offering. This does not mean that either Paul or the Philippians were about to die, though the drink offering could mean that Paul’s blood would soon to be poured out when he was executed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If in your culture people do not sacrifice animals or make drink offerings, this metaphor may be very difficult for your readers to understand. If so, it will be important to make the comparison very clear in your translation. Or you may need to leave out the metaphor altogether and translate only the meaning behind it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>even if I am being poured out:</strong> The Greek verb here is in the present tense, but there are two ways in which that tense is understood here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It should be translated as “even if I am to be poured out….” Paul used the present tense to refer to the future. He knew that the Romans might execute him. He was comparing the “pouring out” with the possibility of his death. <em>(RSV, GNT, NJB, REB, NCV, CEV, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>It should be translated as “even if I am being poured out….” Paul was referring to the suffering that he was already experiencing. <em>(BSB, NIV, GW, NASB, NRSV, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There is stronger support in commentaries and English versions for interpretation (1). Also see 2 Timothy 4:6, where Paul used the same verb to speak of his approaching death.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Those who argue for interpretation (2) say that in the larger context of the letter, Paul nowhere suggested that he expected to die as the result of being in prison. In fact, Paul stated the opposite in 1:25b: “I know that I will remain [alive] and that I will continue with all of you.” See also 1:24 and 2:24. When he used the image of “sacrifice” in 2:17a, referring to the Philippian believers, Paul was not suggesting that they would die because they followed Christ. And in the same way, when Paul referred to himself as being like a “drink offering,” he did not mean that he would die rather than be released from prison. When he talked about a “drink offering” and a “sacrifice,” he was more likely referring to the fact that he and they struggled and suffered as believers.Also Paul used the present tense here (“I am being poured out”), not the future tense (“I will be poured out”). This also implies that he was talking about the suffering he was experiencing when he was writing the letter, not what would happen to him later. The following shows how this interpretation might be translated:I am suffering <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of the good news</span>, just as you are suffering because you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it</span>. Nevertheless, I am glad and rejoice with you all.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sacrifice and service:</strong> This is a figure of speech in which the two words <em>sacrifice</em> and <em>service</em> refer to the same idea. So you could more clearly translate this as “the sacrificial service” or “the sacrificial offering” or “the offering of the sacrifice.” Their <em>sacrifice</em> is another way to say that the Philippians had been dedicated to God, as a sacrifice is dedicated to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of your faith:</strong> A literal translation of the Greek is “of your faith.” There are two basic ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Their <em>faith</em> was the reason or the motive for their “sacrifice”. <em>(NIV, GNT, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>Their <em>faith</em> was the “sacrifice.” The sacrificial offering represents the fact that they believed. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Your faith in the Lord and your service are like a sacrifice offered to him. (CEV) <em>(CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first interpretation seems to be the more likely one in this context. So it is recommended that you follow it (1). The sacrifice was broader than just faith. It consisted of their lives wholly committed to God (SSA).</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:17a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a possible way you could translate 2:17a adding a lot of implicit information:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I may still have to die as a result of my work.</span> When you believed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s message</span>, you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gave yourselves to God like a priest</span> offering a sacrifice to God. If <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Romans kill me,</span> then I will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like wine that the priest would</span> pour over your sacrifice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as an additional offering</span>.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I am glad and rejoice with all of you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But I am still happy and rejoice with you all.</p></li><li><p>But I am nevertheless glad and I am rejoicing with you all.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am glad and rejoice:</strong> In Greek these two verbs come from the same root verb and they can be literally translated as “I rejoice and I rejoice with [you].” Paul rejoiced because it was a privilege to suffer for Jesus Christ. And he said that he rejoiced <u>with</u> the Philippians because they believed the gospel that he preached, and they, like himself, were willing to suffer for their faith. See notes on 2:16c.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:17</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to reorder 2:17 and place 2:17b before 2:17a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I an glad and rejoice with you all, even though I am about to be poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice that you offer to God because you believe.</p></blockquote></div>",

The point was probably that all the other believers who could have gone to Philippi (with the exception of Epaphroditus—see notes on 2:25a) were only concerned about their own interests.

One way you could translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He works with me to tell the good news, helping me like a son who helps his father.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>child:</strong> The BSB translates this Greek word literally as <em>child</em>, as many English translations do.

While he was with Paul, Epaphroditus had become very sick, and almost died, but God had spared his life. The Philippian believers had heard about his illness. Therefore, as soon as he got well, Paul sent him back to Philippi so that the believers there would not worry.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Epaphroditus was probably the person who brought this letter to the Philippians. Therefore, Paul used past tenses in this paragraph as though Epaphroditus had already arrived in Philippi. This was because Paul was already imagining the Philippians reading the letter after Epaphroditus arrived in Philippi. However, in some languages it may be necessary to use a present tense. Use whatever tenses are most natural in your language.</p></div><h4>2:25a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But I have decided that it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus</p></li><li><p>¶ But I have decided that I must send Epaphroditus back to you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">first</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But:</strong> This shows contrast with what Paul had just said. In 2:19–24 he had written about sending Timothy to Philippi. Here in 2:25–30 he wrote that he would send Epaphroditus first.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>send back to you:</strong> This is literally “send to you” (RSV, GNT). But Paul was sending Epaphroditus <em>back</em> to his home town Philippi. So in many languages, it will be appropriate to use a verb that means “to send someone back to where they came from.” However, make sure your translation does not imply that Paul was sending him back because he no longer wanted him or because he thought Epaphroditus had failed. The context makes this clear.</p><h4>2:25b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>my/<span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(incl)</sup></span> brother, the one who works with me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to tell the gospel</span> and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who fights like</span> a soldier with me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to defend the gospel</span>.</p></li><li><p>He has worked together with me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to tell the good news</span> and has helped me struggle <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against the enemies of the gospel</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my brother:</strong> This means “my fellow Christian who is like a brother.” In some languages it is necessary to refer to Epaphroditus as “our<sup>(incl)</sup> brother” instead of as <em>my brother</em> to make it clear that Epaphroditus was a Christian brother to the Philippians as well as to Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is necessary to indicate whether someone is a younger brother or an older brother in relation to someone else. No one knows how old Epaphroditus was. However, if you must choose in your language, it is probably best to consider Epaphroditus as younger than Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fellow worker:</strong> This refers to a person who works together with someone else.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fellow soldier:</strong> This means that Epaphroditus was helping Paul defend the good news against those who opposed it. You could restate the metaphor <em>fellow soldier</em> by using a simile: “he is like a soldier fighting by my side.” In some languages it may be necessary to say whom Paul and Epaphroditus were fighting against. Scholars do not agree about whether these enemies were human enemies of the gospel, Satan and his evil spiritual forces, or both. It is best to use a general expression like “enemies of the good news,” without saying exactly who they were.</p><h4>2:25c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:25c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You sent him to look after my needs, as your representative.</p></li><li><p>You sent him to represent you in helping to provide me with what I needed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>messenger:</strong> This is the Greek word <em>apostolos</em> which is often translated “apostle” in the New Testament. However, the word literally means “representative” or <em>messenger</em> and that is how Paul used it here. Epaphroditus was not an apostle like Peter and Paul. He simply represented those who sent him, that is, the Philippians. The Philippian believers had sent him to help Paul, especially to deliver their gift to him (4:18). See “apostle&quot;, sense 1 in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and minister to my needs:</strong> This is literally “and [your] minister of my needs.” The NIV supplies “whom you sent,” and this model may be helpful in your language also. The Philippian believers had sent Epaphroditus to bring money gifts to Paul and in this way to provide for his needs. They also apparently sent him to help Paul in other ways while he was in prison.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:25</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In your language it may be necessary to change the order of phrases so that the connection between 2:25 and 2:26 is clearer. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>c</sup>You have sent your messenger Epaphroditus to help provide what I need. <sup>b</sup>As my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christian</span> brother he has helped me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with the work of the gospel</span> and struggles with me against <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the enemies of the gospel</span>. <sup>a</sup>I have decided that it is necessary that I send him back to you.</p></blockquote></div>",

But after Epaphroditus got sick and then recovered, Paul wanted even more eagerly to send him back so that the Philippians would know that he was no longer sick. Therefore, Paul said here that he was all the more eager to send him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>send him:</strong> It may be necessary to supply the implied information of where Paul was sending Epaphroditus:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>send him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">back to you</span></p></blockquote><h4>2:28b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:28b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that when you see him again you may rejoice,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you may see him again and be happy,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that when you see him again you may rejoice:</strong> Paul wanted to send Epaphroditus back in order to make the Philippian believers happy. Presumably they would be happy to see Epaphroditus again.

It would mean that the Philippians would no longer worry about Epaphroditus. And it would also mean that Paul would no longer be anxious about the Philippians because they were worrying about Epaphroditus.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>less anxious:</strong> The normal meaning of the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>less anxious</em> is “without pain.” In this context, it does not refer to physical pain, but anxiety or sorrow. Most commentators agree that this form of the Greek word does not mean that Paul would have no sorrow/anxiety, but that his sorrow/anxiety would be lessened.</p>",

It is not clear why Paul had to encourage them to do this. It is possible that he thought that the Philippians might have been angry at Epaphroditus for returning so soon. They had expected him to stay and care for Paul. Thus Paul tried to assure them of how valuable Epaphroditus had been to him, and to convince them that the change of plans was truly what God wanted. Or Paul may simply have been encouraging them to joyfully accept Epaphroditus back, which he expected they would do, as 2:28b implies.</p><h4>2:29a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:29a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Welcome him in the Lord with great joy,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> receive him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">back</span> very joyfully <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as your brother</span> in the Lord.</p></li><li><p>Rejoice that you can welcome your Christian brother <span data-bnType=\"implied\">back home</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Welcome him in the Lord with great joy:</strong> The Philippians should receive Epaphroditus back very happily as their Christian brother.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> There are several ways to understand this phrase.

Paul made it clear that God saves people because of what Jesus has done for them, not because they obey the Jewish laws.</p></div><h4>3:2</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Most commentators agree that the three warnings in this verse all refer to the same group of people. These warnings are about “dogs,” “men who do evil,” and “mutilators.” These apparently were a group of Jews who had become Christians. They were called Judaizers. They were teaching that all Christians had to obey the Jewish laws in order to be true Christians. Paul strongly opposed this teaching and emphasized that people became members of God’s people through spiritual, not physical, change.</p><h4>3:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Watch out for those dogs,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Look out for those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil people who are like</span> dogs.</p></li><li><p>Do not be deceived by those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who are like</span> pagans,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Watch out for:</strong> This means “beware of.” It was a warning to not believe what the Judaizers taught. Some translations say: “do not be deceived by…” or “do not believe….”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those dogs:</strong> Jews often referred to Gentiles as <em>dogs</em>. This was because Jews considered dogs to be unclean animals, and they thought that Gentiles were also ritually unclean. See also Psalm 22:16 and Mark 7:24–30. In this verse Paul turned the idea around. He was saying that <u>the Judaizers</u> were evil and were like dogs. They were like pagans because their teaching was completely wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, using the term <em>dogs</em> may give some other meaning that is not appropriate for this context. It may be possible to use a general term for “dangerous, dirty animal” or it may be best to translate the meaning without the metaphor. For example, it may be possible to translate the phrase <em>those dogs</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who act like nonbelievers</p></blockquote><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>those workers of evil,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Beware of them because</span> what they do is evil.</p></li><li><p>those people who do evil deeds.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those workers of evil:</strong> This makes it clear that the term “dogs” refers to people who are <em>workers of evil</em>. It does not refer to a second group of people.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:2a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to change the order of these two phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>beware of those who do evil things, who are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a pack of</span> dirty dogs</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>those mutilators of the flesh!</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wrongly</span> insist that males <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who want to be Christians</span> must be circumcised.</p></li><li><p>They are cutting up men’s bodies <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for nothing</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those mutilators of the flesh:</strong> This is a third description of the same group of people. They are described as <em>mutilators</em>, literally “the mutilation” or “the cutting up.” This is a play on the Greek word for “circumcision,” which literally means “the cutting around.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">“Circumcision” is the cutting off of a band of skin, called the foreskin, from around the end of the penis. One of the Jewish laws stated that all Jewish males and converts to Judaism had to be circumcised as a symbol that they belonged to God. The Judaizers were teaching that non-Jewish converts to Christianity must also be circumcised. Here in 3:2c Paul opposed this teaching. He said the Judaizers were like people who destroy something by cutting it up or chopping it into pieces. Paul was saying that circumcision was no longer necessary to become part of God’s people and so he used this forceful language to speak against these people by calling them <em>mutilators of the flesh</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures where circumcision is not known, it would be helpful to explain the custom of circumcising people in a footnote or in a glossary. Make sure it is clear that they did not cut off the whole penis but only the small ring of skin around the end of it. If it is not proper in your culture to refer to sex organs, make sure you use acceptable terms here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In most languages it will not be possible to keep Paul’s play on words in the translation. But look for some way to make a contrast between “circumcision” (or “cutting around”) and “mutilation” (or “cutting up”).</p>",

The two possibilities are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“worship by/in the Spirit of God”; <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, NASB, NJB, REB, CEV, NRSV)</em></p></li><li><p>“worship God by/in the Spirit/spirit”; <em>(RSV, KJV, NLT; probably GNT, NCV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">There is no real difference in meaning. It is recommended that you follow the first option (1). Paul was saying that true believers worship with the help of God’s Spirit. However, in some languages it will be necessary to supply an object for <em>worship</em>. If this is true in your language, you should use “God” as the object of <em>worship</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ideas for translating 3:3b are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We worship <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> because his Spirit helps us.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s Spirit is the one who helps us to worship <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God/him</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Spirit of God:</strong> This refers to the Holy Spirit.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:3a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">One way to translate 3:3a–b is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are the true people of God, for by means of God’s <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit we worship <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>.</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> glorify Christ Jesus and do not depend on our<sup>(incl)</sup> own human efforts</p></li><li><p>We<sup>(incl)</sup> take pride in Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and depend on him</span>, rather than depending on what we<sup>(incl)</sup> have done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in order for God to save us<sup>(incl)</sup></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who glory in Christ Jesus:</strong> Here Paul was saying that true believers are proud only of Christ Jesus, and depend only on Christ Jesus to save them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glory:</strong> In this context the Greek word <em>kauchaomai</em>, that the BSB translates as <em>glory</em>, means “to be proud of something,” “to boast about something” or “to rejoice about something.” The same Greek word was used in 2:16 though the form and context are slightly different.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate the whole phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We boast because Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is the one who saves us</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ Jesus is the one we are proud of.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and who put no confidence in the flesh:</strong> This says the same thing as the previous clause but in a negative way. The believer cannot depend on anything but Christ. He cannot trust traditional ceremonies, such as circumcision, or any achievements of his own.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>put…confidence:</strong> In Greek this is one word, a verb that means “to trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in something</span>, to rely/depend <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on something or someone</span>.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>flesh:</strong> The BSB translates this from the Greek word <em>sarx</em>, which literally means <em>flesh</em>. This word <em>sarx</em> is an important term in the New Testament. However, it is used in different ways in different contexts. It is important, therefore, to make the meaning clear in each passage and not just translate it literally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this passage (3:3–6), <em>sarx</em> refers to human tradition, human effort, things to do with the earthly life, and more specifically, things that are outward or external. Paul made a clear contrast between the earthly (3:3–6) and the spiritual (3:7–11). See “flesh” in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ideas for how to translate the phrase “who put no confidence in the flesh”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We do not depend on earthly/physical things.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We do not believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will save us</span> because of the things we do as humans.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We do not depend on earthly behavior <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like circumcision to save us</span>.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:2–3</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some translations have avoided using the idea of “circumcision” in 3:2–3. See 3:2c and 3:3a in the Display. However, circumcision is a very important term in the Bible and at some point you will have to decide how to translate it. Some translations say “cutting ritual,” “cutting ceremony” or “body-cutting ceremony.” Others have tried to follow the Greek and use a word that means circular cutting or cutting around. If you have a glossary in your translation, make sure that you explain the term clearly there.</p></div>",

If you use emphatic pronouns in your language, you may be able to use one here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>could have such confidence:</strong> The text in 3:5–6 lists these reasons. The phrase <em>could have such confidence</em> is one word in Greek. It literally means “grounds/reason for trust.” In some languages it may be necessary to translate it with one or more verbs. For example, the SSA suggests:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>could very well rely on them (SSA)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>such:</strong> The BSB has included this word to connect this verse back to the “confidence in the flesh” that Paul referred to in 3:3c. Paul was referring to why he would have reasons, from a human point of view, to trust in who he was or what he had done, or to depend on human tradition.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1051003004\" data-endVerseId=\"1051003006\"><h3>Paragraph 3:4b–6b</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was saying, “If it would do any good, I could trust in my Jewish background and my custom of strictly following the Jewish laws, in order that God would consider me, more than anyone else, as one who belongs to him.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Translator’s Notes places a paragraph break here (see also SSA) as do some English versions.

His comments fit into two groups. First he listed four things that showed that he was a true Jew (3:5a–c), things that were true about him from the time he was born, not relating to anything he did. Then he listed three things that were the result of what he himself did (3:5d–3:6b). These seven things could have given him reason to be proud of what he was as a Jew. But he chose not to depend on these things.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In your translation you might put a comment at the beginning of 3:5 to show that Paul was giving a list in 3:5–6 of the reasons why he could trust in earthly things. See the second Meaning Line in the Display for 3:5a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>circumcised on the eighth day:</strong> One reason Paul could claim to be a true Jew was that he had been circumcised. God’s law, given through Moses, required this of all Jewish males; it said that they were to be circumcised on the eighth day. This was a sign that they were born as members of God’s chosen people. So Paul was saying that he had been circumcised, just as the law commanded.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>circumcised:</strong> See notes on 3:3a for the meaning of <em>circumcised</em>. If your language does not use passive verbs, you will need to say who circumcised Paul. Normally it was Jewish religious leaders who performed this ceremony.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on the eighth day:</strong> By the Jewish method of counting, the day a baby was born was his first day. So <em>on the eighth day</em> means when he was seven days or one week old. Make sure you use the method of counting used by your culture.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the first meaning line in the Display says “just as God commanded <u>our (excl)</u> ancestors.” The exclusive form of “our” here means that since the Philippians were Gentiles, they did not have the same ancestors as the Jews. See also the meaning lines for 3:5d, 3:6a and 3:6b.</p><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I belong to the people of Israel. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">In fact,</span> I belong to the tribe of Benjamin.</p></li><li><p>I am a descendant of Jacob and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even</span> from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his son,</span> Benjamin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of the people of Israel:</strong> Paul was a descendant of Jacob. God changed Jacob’s name to Israel and his descendants were known as the people of Israel. So Paul could say he was related to all the Israelites.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of the tribe of Benjamin:</strong> Only a few Jews were able to list the names of their ancestors going back to the beginning of one of the tribes of Israel. But Paul knew that he was a descendant of Benjamin. This means that he belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, who was one of the twelve sons of Jacob.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators say that it was a special privilege to be a descendant of Benjamin. For example, according to Hawthorne, there are many reasons why the Jews considered it a special privilege to be a descendant of the tribe of Benjamin. This list includes only a few of these reasons:(a) Benjamin was one of the two favorite sons of Jacob, whose mother was Rachel, Jacob’s favorite wife.(b) Benjamin was the only one of Jacob’s twelve sons who was born in the promised land of Canaan.(c) Israel’s first king, Saul, came from the tribe of Benjamin.(d) Jerusalem and the temple were located in the territory of Benjamin.(e) The tribe of Benjamin remained loyal to King David when the kingdom was divided between Judah and Israel.</span></span> Two ideas for translation are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I belong to the tribe of Benjamin.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even</span> come from the family of Benjamin.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>tribe:</strong> The sons of Jacob were the leaders of their own families, which in time became clans because each son had many descendants. They also called each clan a <em>tribe</em>, even though all the clans or tribes spoke the same language, Hebrew.</p><h4>3:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a Hebrew of Hebrews;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">pure</span> Hebrew and my ancestors were also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">pure</span> Hebrews.</p></li><li><p>My parents were Hebrews, so I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span> am a Hebrew.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a Hebrew of Hebrews:</strong> Paul was saying that he was a true Jew and so were his parents. You could restate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am a true Hebrew, born of true Hebrews.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Hebrew:</strong> Some commentators say that the word <em>Hebrew</em> refers to those who were racially pure as Jews, with no Gentile blood in them. Others say it refers to Jews who followed the traditional customs, who still spoke the Hebrew language, and who considered themselves to be religious Jews. Still others say the word <em>Hebrew</em> has both of the above meanings.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Other Jews not called Hebrews spoke more Greek and had adopted more of the Greek ways. See Acts 6:1 for an example of conflict between these Jews and Jews called “Hebrews.”</span></span> Paul was born outside Palestine, in Tarsus, but he insisted that he was a true Hebrew.</p><h4>3:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as to the law, a Pharisee;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>As far as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Moses I was</span> a Pharisee.</p></li><li><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very carefully obeyed all</span> the laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that our<sup>(excl)</sup> ancestors gave us<sup>(excl)</sup> because I was</span> a Pharisee.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">After listing the things that were true of him since he was born, Paul here listed the three things he had done of which he could have been proud.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as to the law, a Pharisee:</strong> If anyone questioned whether Paul followed the Jewish laws, his answer was that he was (or had been) a Pharisee. In some languages it will be necessary to use the verb “to be” here. If so, it is necessary to decide which tense to use. Most likely Paul was thinking, as with 3:6a–b, of what he <u>had been</u>, before he became a Christian and so it is better to use a past tense: “in regard to the law <u>I was</u> a Pharisee.” Most English versions which supply a verb here follow this (GNT, NET, NLT, GW, NJB) and it also has good commentary support.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>as to:</strong> This phrase in 3:5d and the next two phrases in 3:6 start with the same word in Greek: <em>kata</em>. This preposition can be translated in several ways, including, as in the NIV, <em>in regard to</em>. In some languages it is possible to translate it the same way each time, but in other languages it may be necessary to vary the expression.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the law:</strong> This refers to the Jewish religious laws in general and to the laws of Moses in particular, on which the religious laws were based.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Pharisee:</strong> The Pharisees were a group within Judaism who were particularly strict about obeying the Jewish laws. They were very concerned about each point in the law. Before he became a Christian, Paul had faithfully followed the teachings and practices of this group.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You could translate the word <em>Pharisee</em> as “the Pharisee group.” This is an important word that should be in your glossary if you have one. See “Pharisee&quot; in KBT. Many readers know the name <em>Pharisee</em> because they have read the gospels. In some languages it may be necessary to explain in this context who the Pharisees were. If this is so in your language, you could use a footnote, or include some implicit information in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was a Pharisee, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which meant that I carefully obeyed the law.</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was a member of the Pharisee group, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who thoroughly follow the law.</span></p></blockquote>",

Therefore, it is possible to consider that 3:1 is an introduction to this section and 4:1 is a summary of this section.

Other English versions keep 3:4b together with 3:4a. This is perhaps because it divides up a single Greek sentence.</p></div><h4>3:6a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as to zeal, persecuting the church;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I wanted so strongly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do what I thought God wanted me to do</span> that I made the followers of Jesus suffer.</p></li><li><p>I was so loyal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to what I thought would please God</span> that I greatly harmed the disciples of Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>zeal:</strong> The word <em>zeal</em> means “a strong feeling in favor of something.” Here it means that Paul strongly desired to be religious and to encourage people to honor God. This was an attitude that the Jews highly respected. You could translate the word <em>zeal</em> (or the phrase “as for zeal”) as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I strongly desired to honor God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>persecuting the church:</strong> Before Paul became a believer, he had greatly harmed those who followed Christ. He beat some, put others in prison and caused others to die (Acts 8:1–3, 9:1–2). He did this because he thought they were against the Jewish laws and the Jewish religion. He thought the best way he could serve God was to get rid of Jesus’ disciples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the church:</strong> This refers to Christ’s followers, not to any building they met in. You could translate this as “those who believed in Jesus” or “the people who followed Jesus.”</p><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as to righteousness in the law, faultless.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In obeying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our<sup>(excl)</sup> Jewish</span> laws, I was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as</span> righteous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a person could become</span> because I obeyed them all.</p></li><li><p>No one could find any cause for blame in me, because I obeyed all the Jewish laws.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>righteousness in the law:</strong> This is literally “righteousness that is in law.” This <em>law</em> refers to the law of Moses, found in the first five books of the Old Testament. Paul meant that he did what was right according to the Jewish laws. He was righteous in an external or legal sense. But this is different from being righteous according to God’s standard, which is based on what people think and desire, not just what they do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faultless:</strong> When Paul wrote this letter, he knew he was a sinner. But here in 3:6 he was thinking about the time before he believed in Christ. He claimed that at that previous time he had obeyed all the Jewish laws. No one could have blamed him or said he was at fault for disobeying any of the Jewish laws. You could translate the word <em>faultless</em> here as “no one could find one law that I disobeyed.” In some languages it may be helpful to reverse the order in this phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no one who can accuse me of disobeying the law, because I obeyed it all.</p></blockquote>",

Nothing mattered to him besides knowing Jesus Christ better.</p></div><h4>3:7a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But whatever was gain to me</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ But the things I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">formerly</span> considered to be so valuable,</p></li><li><p>¶ But the things I formerly depended on <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God to save me</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ But the things that previously made me proud <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a Jew</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whatever was gain to me:</strong> Paul was referring mainly to the things he had mentioned in 3:5–6. These were things that he could be proud of as a person and as a Jew. But in his relation to Jesus Christ, these things did not make him proud. They did not help him to know Jesus Christ better.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gain:</strong> This term was used in business transactions to refer to financial gain. But Paul was using the term as a metaphor to mean “advantage” in general. In some languages it may be necessary to drop the metaphor and translate this meaning. Some ways to do this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the things for which I thought <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> accepted me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>everything I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">mistakenly</span> thought I could trust in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that God would save me</span></p></blockquote><h4>3:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I count as loss for the sake of Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I now consider as worthless because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my relationship to</span> Christ.</p></li><li><p>I rejected those things because they have no value as far as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my relationship to</span> Christ is concerned.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I count as loss for the sake of Christ:</strong> After he came to know Jesus Christ, Paul thought about the things he was formerly proud of in a new way. He realized that they were worthless in comparison to knowing Christ. And he chose to count them as without value so that he could belong to Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I count:</strong> The Greek verb form here could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have come to realize</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have come to regard [them]</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>loss:</strong> Like “gain” in 3:7a, <em>loss</em> was a term used in business transactions. It referred to financial loss. Paul was using the term as a metaphor to refer to the uselessness of his worldly advantages. There are two possible ways to translate this Greek word:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>something that does not help, that is worthless or without value. In the context of 3:7b, you could translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>these things did not help me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to know Christ</span> <em>(GW, NLT, CEV, NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>something that harms, hinders or prevents something from happening (NET). This would mean that the things Paul used to be proud of actually hindered him from knowing Christ. In the context of 3:7b, you could translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>these things hindered me from knowing Christ</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The immediate context (in particular 3:8) strongly supports interpretation (1). It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>for the sake of:</strong> The Greek preposition that the BSB translates as <em>for the sake of</em> occurs three times in 3:7 and 3:8. It could also be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>because of</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>on account of</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:7</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Two versions give additional ideas for translation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But Christ has shown me that what I once thought was valuable is worthless.

Paul apparently felt that the statement in 3:7 was not strong enough. So in 3:8 he added more to what he said in 3:7. Do not just translate <em>More than that</em> literally. Look for a natural way to strengthen and intensify something that has already been said. Some ideas are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And that is not all….</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Besides all that….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I count all things as loss:</strong> Paul was saying, “I consider everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that was gain to me before</span> a loss <span data-bnType=\"implied\">now</span>.” The term <em>all things</em> indicates that Paul is including more than the things he listed in 3:5–6. He meant that everything he previously depended on for God to save him had no real value.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I count:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>I count</em> is in the present tense. This contrasts with the perfect tense Paul used in 3:7b. This change in tense is another way of emphasizing and intensifying what he was saying.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>loss:</strong> This is the same term used in 3:7b. See notes there.</p><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>compared to the surpassing excellence</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when I compare it to what is far more valuable,</p></li><li><p>in comparison with that which has much greater value,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>compared to:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>compared to</em> is the same preposition translated as “for the sake of” in 3:7. In this verse it can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It indicates comparison. Paul was <u>comparing</u> his past life with knowing Christ. <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, REB, NLT, CEV, NCV).</em></p></li><li><p>It indicates cause. Paul was <u>giving the reason</u> why he considered everything a loss. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth…. (RSV) <em>(GNT, NJB, RSV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either meaning is possible and both may be implied. The two meanings are not contradictory. Paul chose knowing Christ over everything else because it was better. So if you can translate in such as way as to make both possibilities understood, you should do so. If not, it is recommended that you follow the first interpretation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the surpassing excellence:</strong> When Paul considered the things he formerly was proud of, they seemed worthless when he compared them with knowing Christ. All that comes with knowing Christ is far greater than all the other things people could depend on. Use the strongest terms you can to describe how great and priceless knowing Christ is, and how small and without value these other things are.</p><h4>3:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is, really</span> knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">which is that I personally</span> know Christ Jesus, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is</span> my Lord.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord:</strong> Paul knew Jesus Christ personally, and this was much more valuable than anything else. The idea of <em>knowing Christ</em> may be difficult to translate in some languages where the idea of knowing a person may only mean that you have met him and know who he is. It may not include the deeper meaning that Paul implied here in 3:8c, of knowing Jesus personally. It may be necessary to say something like “<u>really</u> knowing” or “knowing <u>personally</u>.”</p><h4>3:8d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for whom I have lost all things.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because of him, I have given up everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I depended on to be saved</span>.</p></li><li><p>I have abandoned/renounced all <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those</span> things in order to please him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 3:8 the language of business and money that began in 3:7 continues. Paul was saying that he willingly gave up one thing in order to gain another thing which was worth much more. Jesus used similar words in the parable of the pearl of great price (Matthew 13:45–46) and in his teaching about discipleship (Matthew 16:26).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for whom:</strong> This means “for the sake of Christ Jesus” or “because of Christ Jesus.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have lost all things:</strong> Paul was describing how he willingly gave up all the things he formerly was proud of in order to know Christ. He not only considered them as loss, but he voluntarily gave them up. He did not cease to be all the things he described in 3:5a–c, but he rejected these things as worthless. See also the note on 3:8a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, to say “I lost something” implies that a person accidentally lost it. If that is so in your language it will be better to say something like “I have thrown everything else away.”</p><h4>3:8e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I regard them as garbage/trash/filth so that I might <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fully</span> belong to Christ,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I consider them rubbish:</strong> There are two ways to interpret how this phrase relates to the phrases before and after it.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>I consider them rubbish</em> relates directly to the following phrase “that I may gain Christ”. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, REB, NJB)</em></p></li><li><p>The phrase <em>I consider them rubbish</em> is a comment that Paul added, something that is separate from the main thing he was saying. It would mean that the phrase in 3:8e “that I may gain Christ” would be the purpose of 3:8d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I may have Christ. (NLT) <em>(GW, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul regarded all his previous advantages as rubbish in order to obtain Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rubbish:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rubbish</em> can also mean “dung, excrement.” These things (3:7a–8a) were not only worthless, but Paul hated them. He considered them filthy. He was glad to get rid of them. Some ideas for translating this word “dung,” “something rotten,” “garbage” or “trash which I throw away.” Avoid using a word that might offend your readers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that I may gain Christ:</strong> Paul continued to use the business metaphor of buying and selling here. Here it means that he wanted to belong fully to Christ, to know him more and more. Paul already belonged to Christ and knew him, but he wanted to know him better. Some ways to translate the phrase <em>gain Christ</em> are: “belong to Christ,” “know Christ,” “follow Christ,” “obey Christ.”</p>",

The meaning is “be in fact in him,” “prove to be in him” or “turn out to be in him.” It did not refer to someone else finding Paul in some way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some translation ideas for this part of the verse are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I might belong to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I might live in unity with him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>so that I might be joined together with him</p></blockquote><h4>3:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not having my own righteousness from the law,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have stopped trying to become right <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law.</p></li><li><p>It is not because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I obeyed</span> the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jewish</span> laws that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God declares</span> me to be righteous.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not having my own righteousness:</strong> Paul had learned that nothing he could do as a good Jew could make him truly righteous as far as God was concerned, even if he appeared “righteous” to other people. So he no longer wanted this kind of false righteousness.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> In the context of 3:9b, this refers to Paul’s attempt to earn a right relationship to God by behaving in a morally upright manner. Before he became a Christian, Paul had thought that his own efforts would make him acceptable to God. See “righteousness&quot;, under “just&quot;, sense C4 in KBT.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from the law:</strong> Paul was referring to the time in the past when he tried to be right with God by keeping the Jewish laws. Notice in 3:6b he used a similar phrase “righteousness in the law” (that is, “what is right in terms of the law”). In that verse Paul claimed that he was faultless in that kind of righteousness. But here in 3:9b he stated that he had rejected that righteousness. Then in 3:9c–d he contrasted it with the righteousness that a person receives by trusting in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some translation ideas for “my own righteousness from the law” are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my own righteousness that comes from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying</span> the law</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God to consider</span> me righteous because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did</span> what the law says</p></blockquote><h4>3:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but that which is through faith in Christ,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God has declared me righteous</span> because I believe in Christ.</p></li><li><p>It is because I trust Christ.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that which is through faith in Christ:</strong> This refers to that true righteousness, which a person receives by trusting in Christ.

It is the righteousness that God gives to those who trust in Christ. A person is not righteous because of how he behaves or because people consider him good or right. He is truly righteous when God declares him so because he trusts in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>on the basis of faith:</strong> You could translate this as “for those who believe.” It refers to those who trust Christ to save them. Notice that this is very similar to 3:9c.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:9c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">As 3:9c and 3:9d overlap in meaning, in some languages it may be better to combine them.

Nothing mattered to him besides knowing Jesus Christ better.</p></div><h4>3:10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse begins with the phrase “I want to know Christ.” Paul followed this with three phrases that show three ways that he could know Christ: by the power of Christ’s resurrection, by the fellowship of sharing Christ’s sufferings, and by becoming like Christ in his death.</p><h4>3:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I want to know Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It is my aim to know Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">more</span>.</p></li><li><p>I want to know <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and experience</span> Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">better, like this:</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I want to know Christ:</strong> This does not mean to know about Christ. It means to know and experience Christ personally. Paul already knew Christ, but he wanted to know him better.</p><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the power of His resurrection</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want to experience/feel/know</span> the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">same</span> power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God gave Christ</span> when he became alive again <span data-bnType=\"implied\">after he had died</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want Christ to work within me with</span> that power he has because he has risen again,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the power of His resurrection:</strong> The power of Christ’s resurrection was already influencing Paul’s life, but he wanted to experience it more. This is one of the ways that a person can know Christ better.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several ways to understand the phrase <em>the power of His resurrection</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the power Christ received after God raised him from the dead. This could be translated:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want to have the power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">had</span> when he rose again.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the God’s power that raised Christ from the dead. This could be translated:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want to experience the same power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God used when he caused</span> Christ to live again <span data-bnType=\"implied\">after he had died</span>. <em>(NCV, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions do not specify how they understand his phrase, but both interpretations have strong support from commentators. It is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1). Paul probably meant that knowing Christ included Paul experiencing the power that is now Christ’s.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul wanted this power so that he could behave in the way that pleased God and so that he could effectively teach others God’s message.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>resurrection:</strong> In some languages the word <em>resurrection</em> can mean to come back to life as a different person or as a different living thing. This is not the meaning of <em>resurrection</em> in the Bible. If this is a problem in your language, you need to translate in a way that makes it clear that <em>resurrection</em> means a person becoming alive again as the same person.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:10a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">One way to connect 3:10a–b is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I want to know Christ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">better in this way: I want to know</span> the power of his resurrection.</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the fellowship of His sufferings,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want to have</span> fellowship with him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by</span> suffering <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for him</span> as he suffered <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for me</span>.</p></li><li><p>and I want to be Christ’s partner by suffering just as he suffered.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and the fellowship of His sufferings:</strong> This is the second way in which a person can know Christ better.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are two main ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was already suffering for Christ and he wanted more of the fellowship with Christ that comes from following him. He did not want to suffer, but he wanted to know Christ more and more even though that meant suffering.</p></li><li><p>Paul wanted to share by faith (mentally) the sufferings that Christ had.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first interpretation has stronger support. It is recommended that you follow it (1). Paul did not want to suffer. But he knew that everyone who follows Christ faithfully should expect to suffer because those who refuse to follow Christ oppose them (2 Timothy 3:12). And he wanted the fellowship with Christ that would accompany this suffering.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fellowship:</strong> In this context this means “sharing in something with someone.” See note on “partnership” in 1:5a, and “fellowship&quot;, sense A2 in KBT. This sense is brought out by the BSB when it supplies the words “sharing in.”</p><h4>3:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>being conformed to Him in His death,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> want to become united with him in his death,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I want</span> to die <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in relation to sinning</span> just as he died <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to take away sin</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>being conformed to Him in His death:</strong> This is a difficult phrase to understand and most English versions translate it more or less literally. There are two ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is meant literally. Paul wanted to become like Christ by suffering as Christ did even to the point of death.</p></li><li><p>It is meant figuratively. Paul wanted to die to sin.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Both interpretations have strong support, but it is more likely that Paul was referring here to physical death, just as he had been referring to physical sufferings in 3:10c. So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul said that he wanted to become like Christ in every aspect of his life. He even wanted to die like Christ died. This means that he was willing to have people persecute him and kill him for his faith just like people killed Christ.</p>",

You might translate this as “brothers and sisters,” “older and younger siblings” or “relatives.” The term <em>Brothers</em> also occurs in 1:12, 3:1, 3:17, 4:1, 4:8. See the note on 1:12a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it:</strong> Paul was saying in other words what he had already said in 3:12a. He had not yet become all that God wanted him to be.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>consider:</strong> This means “to regard, believe, say.” But here Paul referred to more than just his opinion of himself. He <u>knew</u> that he had not yet achieved what God wanted him to be.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>taken hold of it:</strong> See the note on 3:12c.</p><h4>3:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But one thing I do:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But there is one thing that I aim to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">above all else</span>:</p></li><li><p>But I am doing one thing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that is the most important</span>:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>one thing I do:</strong> Paul was introducing the main thing that he wanted to do. He was about to explain what he wanted more than anything else. He did this by comparing himself to a man running a race to win a prize.</p><h4>3:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Just as one who runs in a race does not look back but runs forward as hard/fast as he can, so</span> I forget about what has already happened and continue to work hard to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be what Christ wants me to be</span>.</p></li><li><p>I no longer think about the past but I concentrate on the future,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead:</strong> The phrase <em>what is behind</em> refers to Paul’s past, particularly to the things he used to boast about (3:5–6). This would include what happened before he became a Christian, and perhaps even some of what happened after he became a Christian.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Forgetting:</strong> Paul did not want to concentrate on his past. This does not mean he would completely forget but that it would not be the main thing he thought about. He compared this to a man running a race and not looking back to see who was close behind him or how far he had run. Make sure that your translation clearly means that Paul <u>intended</u> to forget these things. You might need to use a word meaning “ignoring,” or you might need to use a negative like “not concentrating on” or “not paying any attention to.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>straining toward what is ahead:</strong> This also is using the metaphor of a race. The runner pushes himself forward as fast as he can. He tries to be the first to reach the finish line. The meaning here is that Paul was disciplining himself to become more like Christ, trying hard and doing his best to be what Christ wanted him to be.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If people run races in your culture, then it may be possible to use this metaphor. But if people in your culture do not know about racing, you may need to explain that in your translation. See the first meaning line of 3:13c in the Display. Or you may need to leave out the metaphor and translate only the meaning. For an example, see the second meaning line of 3:13c in the Display.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>behind…ahead:</strong> Because Paul was using the metaphor of a race here, these words can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>position in space</u>: That is, within Paul’s metaphor of the race, the word <em>behind</em> means “in back of” or “at the rear of,” and the word <em>ahead</em> means “in front of.”</p></li><li><p><u>position in time</u>: When Paul used the metaphor of a race, he was referring to his life. In this case, the word <em>behind</em> means “in the past, what happened before now,” and the word <em>ahead</em> means “in the future, what will happen later.”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Consider the following when you translate these words:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>In some languages, there may be words meaning “behind” and “ahead” which have the same dual meaning of space and time as the words do in Greek and English. If you have such words in your language, you should use them here.</p></li><li><p>If you must decide which words to use, you should use sense (a) above, if you have used the metaphor of a race. Use sense (b) if you have not been able to retain the metaphor.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">In some cultures the people think of the past as figuratively in front of them or “ahead,” because they can visualize what has already happened. They then think of the future as “behind,” something unknown that they cannot visualize. If this is true in your language, you need to be careful to use the correct terms so people understand what Paul was saying.</p>",

See note there. In terms of the race metaphor here, the phrase <em>press on</em> means to keep on running. Paul was comparing himself to a determined runner, going toward his goal and not looking back. What he meant was that he continued trying, to work hard to become more like Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>goal:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>goal</em> means the “aim, end, object” of something. In the race metaphor, it refers to the finish line which each runner is trying to be the first to cross. But here Paul was probably referring to the thing he had been talking about in 3:10–13. His aim or goal was to become completely like Christ. This would include knowing him completely.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prize:</strong> A <em>prize</em> is a reward for winning a race or doing something well. The next note discusses what this prize was.</p><h4>3:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of God’s heavenly calling in Christ Jesus.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">And the reward is</span> that God calls me to go up <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to heaven</span> because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has done for me</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That great prize is</span> God calling me to heaven because Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">died for me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of God’s heavenly calling:</strong> It is not clear how this clause connects back to “the prize” mentioned in 3:14a. There are two main possibilities<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a third possibility. The following is a comment by Dick Elkins:“Can it be that the prize was going to heaven? God must call someone to heaven before he can receive the prize. But if going to heaven <u>was</u> the prize, then it would seem that Paul was implying that salvation is the result not of faith alone but of faith plus extreme persistence. In the <em>Word Biblical Commentary</em> Hawthorne remarks:‘In keeping with the vivid imagery drawn from the Greek games that pervades this section there is still another explanation that seems the most reasonable explanation of all. It sees in the Greek expression <em>tēs anō klēseōs</em> “the upward call” an allusion to the fact that the Olympian games, which included foot races, were organized and presided over by…highly respected officers, called Hellenokidai. After each event they had a herald announce the name of the victor, his father’s name and his country, and the athlete would come and receive a palm branch at their hands. This is the call to which Paul was here alluding. Such an explanation as this has the virtue of not identifying “the upward call” with the prize, and allows the force of the context to determine what Paul had in mind when he spoke of that prize. For him it was to be found “in Christ,” that is, Christ was his prize. To know Christ fully and completely was the prize for which he had been striving ever since his encounter with Christ on the Damascus Road.’Hawthorne paraphrases: “…the prize that God…will give me when he calls me up and announces my name, the prize that is contained in Christ Jesus.”You could translate this meaning as follows:I keep on going toward the goal to get that prize that God will give me when he calls me to heaven, which is this: he will cause me to become like Christ Jesus.</span></span>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It identifies the prize. The prize was that God called Paul heavenwards to make him completely like Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the prize, which is God’s call…to the life above (GNT) <em>(CEV, NET, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The prize that God called Paul heavenwards to receive. Paul did not identify the prize itself. <em>(NIV, NLT, NCV, GW, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first interpretation fits the context better here. So it is recommended that you follow it (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>heavenly:</strong> The Greek word here literally means “upwards.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> God can call or invite people to be with him in heaven because of what Christ has done for them. So you could translate 3:14b as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God calls me to heaven <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be with him</span> because of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what</span> Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">has done for me</span>.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:14</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reorder this verse. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I continue trying hard until God calls me to heaven because of Christ Jesus. In doing this I am <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a runner</span> racing toward the finish line to receive a prize.</p></blockquote></div>",

In many languages it does not make sense to say that someone is an “enemy of the cross.” The Display for 3:18b shows some ways to translate this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Many:</strong> It may be necessary to include some implicit information here to clarify who these <em>Many</em> were. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Many <span data-bnType=\"implied\">say they are Christians, but they</span> act like they hate the message about Christ dying on the cross.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul does not say explicitly whether these people were Christians or not, even though they claimed to be.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>live:</strong> As in 3:17b, the word that the BSB translates as <em>live</em> refers here to acting or behaving in a certain way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the cross of Christ:</strong> This means “the cross on which Jesus died.” Here this is used figuratively to refer to the significance or purpose of Christ’s death.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:18</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reorder this verse so that the main thing Paul is saying comes at the beginning.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In the context of the rest of 3:19 (the more general ideas of shameful things and earthly things), it seems that 3:19b also refers to the more general idea of the desires of the body rather than just the desire for food.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">By saying that the desires of their bodies were <em>their god</em>, Paul meant that they obeyed these desires as they would a god.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They care only about the things they want here on earth.</p></blockquote><h4>3:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and their glory is in their shame.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They boast about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing</span> shameful things.</p></li><li><p>They are proud of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">doing things</span> of which they ought to be ashamed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their glory:</strong> This means that these people glory in something or are proud of something.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>their shame:</strong> This refers to the shameful things these people do. For example, it refers to the sort of things Paul talked about in 3:19b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The things they did were shameful and they ought to have been ashamed of them, but they were not. In fact, they were even proud of the way they behaved. The whole phrase then means that they were proud of the things they did, things of which they ought to have been ashamed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it will not be possible to use nouns like “glory” and <em>shame</em>, but it will be necessary to use verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They are proud of what they should be ashamed of (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>They…brag about the disgusting things they do (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:19d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:19d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Their minds are set on earthly things.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> things they think about are the things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that affect life here</span> on earth.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">All</span> they give attention to are the things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that people here</span> on earth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">think are important</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Their minds are set on earthly things:</strong> These people constantly thought about the things on earth.

You might translate this as “brothers and sisters,” “older and younger siblings” or “relatives.” The term <em>brothers</em> also occurs in 1:12, 3:1, 3:13, 3:17, 4:8. See the note on 1:12a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whom I love and long for:</strong> Once again Paul told the Philippians how much he loved them. The phrase <em>long for</em> means to wish strongly to see someone because you love him very much. See note on “I long for all of you” in 1:8, where the same Greek word is used.</p><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my joy and crown,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you who make me happy and who are my reward,</p></li><li><p>You cause me to be joyful and you are my prize <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for the work I have done</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my joy:</strong> When Paul called the Philippians his <em>joy</em> in this verse, he meant that they caused Paul to be happy. Some possible ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you give me joy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you make me happy</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and crown:</strong> When Paul called the Philippians his <em>crown</em>, he meant they were his reward for the work he had done. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>crown</em> refers to the ring of leaves that was placed on the head of someone who had just won a race or competition. It was his reward/prize for winning. Therefore, it is possible that Paul was thinking of the reward that he would get in heaven because of how he had discipled the Philippians. They were like his reward because they had believed in Christ and were following him. Here is an idea for translating the word <em>crown</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you are the reward for my work</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul also used the ideas of “joy” and <em>crown</em> together in 1 Thessalonians 2:19.</p><h4>4:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that is how you must stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Dear friends, on the basis of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all I have told you,</span> remain strong in your faith in the Lord in this way.</p></li><li><p>You should continue firmly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">trusting and obeying</span> the Lord like that, my dear friends.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that is how:</strong> The Greek word <em>houtōs</em> that the BSB translates as <em>that is how</em> can also be translated as “in this way” or “so.” Paul encouraged the Philippians to stand firm in the way he had just been describing in the previous verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>stand firm in the Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>stand firm</em> is also used in 1:27c–d. It literally just means “stand,” but Paul used it figuratively to mean “be steadfast.” Paul wanted the Philippians to be strong in their faith no matter what happened to them. A possible rendering for the phrase <em>stand firm in the Lord</em> in this context is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>remain loyal to the Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my beloved:</strong> The BSB translates this phrase from the same Greek word from which it translates the phrase “whom I love” in 4:1a. Think about whether it is better in your language to repeat the same idea or to use a different expression here in your translation. See also the note on “my beloved” in 2:12a.</p>",

It is not necessary to translate it with the same word you use to indicate agreement (the normal use of the English word <em>Yes</em>). Other English versions have used “indeed” or “moreover.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you:</strong> The word <em>you</em> is singular here. This is the only time in the letter to Philippians that Paul addressed just one person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my true:</strong> This refers to what is true or genuine. Paul was referring to a person who was not false but true to his claim of being a faithful disciple of Christ. People could depend on him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>yokefellow:</strong> The Greek word <em>suzugos</em> here means “fellow worker” or “partner.” There are two ways to interpret this term:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is a common noun, not a name.

The person Paul was talking to was a member of the church at Philippi and his name was Syzygos. Paul was using both the name and its meaning, as he did with the name “Onesimus” in Philemon 11. <em>(NJB, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) has strong commentary support. Also the name Syzygos is not known elsewhere in Greek literature. So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to help these women:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to say explicitly what Paul wanted this man to help the women to do. If you need to do this in your language, you could say “help these women to live in peace with each other” or “…to agree with one another.”</p><h4>4:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who have labored with me for the gospel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because they have worked hard with me to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">help me</span> proclaim the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Jesus Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>because they have struggled together with me to help <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people hear</span> the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who have labored with me for the gospel:</strong> Paul reminded his “yokefellow” that Euodia and Syntyche had worked hard with Paul to defend the gospel and to tell people about Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who:</strong> The Greek term that the BSB translates as <em>who</em> has been understood in several ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It introduces a reason: “for they, since they…” <em>(RSV, GNT, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>It defines the women: “[the women] who…” <em>(BSB, NIV, NASB, KJV)</em></p></li><li><p>It begins a new clause that comments on the women’s work: “they [contended]…” <em>(NET, GW, NJB, REB, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The first interpretation has the strongest commentary support and is recommended (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>labored with me:</strong> The Greek word that BSB translates as <em>labored</em> is the same word that Paul used in 1:27 (see note on 1:27c–d). It means to join someone else in a struggle to do something.

A gentle person means someone who is calm and moderate, who considers what others need and not just what he himself needs. It means someone who does not insist on his own rights or his own way of doing things. It also means someone who is reasonable and fair-minded, and patient when others misunderstand him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be apparent:</strong> In languages with no passives it will be necessary to translate this with an active verb. Some ways to do this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Show all people that you are gentle.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let everyone see that you are gentle.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to all:</strong> This means to all human beings, not just to all believers.</p><h4>4:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The Lord is near.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Don’t forget that</span> the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus will return</span> soon.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Remember that</span> the Lord is about to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">come back</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The Lord is near:</strong> There are two ways to interpret this expression:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to time, that is, Paul expected the Lord to return to earth soon. <em>(GNT, CEV, NLT, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It refers to location.

If it is possible in your language, you could choose a word or phrase that can mean both close in space and close in time. However, if you must make a choice, choose interpretation (1). Paul probably meant that believers should continue to expect the Lord to return at any time. This should cause all believers to act properly as his true disciples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>The Lord:</strong> This refers to the Lord Jesus.</p>",

See note there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> The term <em>brothers</em> here refers to other Christians, fellow believers, not to literal <em>brothers</em>. You might translate this as “brothers and sisters,” “older and younger siblings” or “relatives.” The term <em>brothers</em> also occurs in 1:12, 3:1, 3:13, 3:17, 4:1.

In this sentence the word <em>if</em> does not mean that Paul did not know whether there was anything excellent or not. He knew there were many very good things in the world.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>praiseworthy:</strong> This refers to things that deserve to be praised.

It refers to what people say, what they do, what people think and how they act toward other people.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comments on 4:8</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to reorder the verse in some way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One possible reordering is to put 4:8f at the beginning of the verse as an introduction. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Finally, brothers and sisters, these are the things you should think about: things that are true, things that are noble….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another possibility is also to reorder the list itself. The last two qualities (4:8e), “excellent” and “praiseworthy,” are a sort of summary of the first six qualities. So in some languages it may be helpful to begin the list with these qualities. The GNT has done this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In conclusion, my friends, fill your minds with those things that are good and that deserve praise: things that are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, and honorable. (GNT)</p></blockquote></div>",

They saw in what he did an example of each of the qualities he described in 4:8. The phrase <em>in me</em> is thus related in meaning to all four verbs “learned,” “received,” “heard,” and “seen,” but grammatically it is connected just to “seen.” It may be necessary to supply “from me” with the other three verbs, as the BSB has done.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>put it into practice:</strong> Paul was asking them to follow his example, to obey his teaching and to imitate how he had acted.</p><h4>4:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And the God of peace will be with you.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as a result</span>, God, who gives you peace, will be with you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And:</strong> That is, “as a result of doing all this.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the God of peace will be with you:</strong> God would give the Philippian believers peace of heart and peace with one another if they would follow the instructions that Paul had been giving them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the God of peace:</strong> This means “the God who gives peace” (GNT, GW, CEV, NCV).</p>",

They were concerned that he should have the things that he needed.</p><h4>4:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now I rejoice greatly in the Lord</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I belong to</span> the Lord, I am very joyful</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Now</em> (<em>de</em>) implies that Paul was starting to write about something different from what he had been writing about. It is not a time word. Many English versions, including the NIV, do not translate this Greek word. But your language may have a word or phrase that shows when the speaker or writer changes to a different topic. If so, it may be appropriate to use that word or phrase here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I rejoice:</strong> In Greek the verb that the BSB translates as <em>I rejoice</em> is in the past tense. That indicates that Paul was happy when he received the gift. However, most English versions use a present tense. This is probably to make it clear that Paul began rejoicing when he first received the gift and was still rejoicing at the time he wrote the letter to the Philippians. You should use the tense in your language that best gives this meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>greatly:</strong> In the Greek this word is emphasized. Make sure this is an important word in your translation: Paul rejoiced “exceedingly” or “immensely.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> Paul did not rejoice for selfish reasons (that is, because of the gift alone) but <em>in the Lord</em>, that is, because he belonged to the Lord.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> That is, the Lord Jesus.</p><h4>4:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that at last you have revived your concern for me.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because finally you have demonstrated again that you care about me.</p></li><li><p>because after a long time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of not helping me</span>, you have again shown <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by sending me a gift</span> that you think about me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and want to help me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that:</strong> Paul now gave the reason why he was rejoicing. This can also be translated “because.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at last:</strong> It had apparently been a long time since Paul had heard from the Philippians or received a gift from them. The phrase <em>at last</em> means “now, after a long time.” It does not imply that Paul was angry or irritated that he had not heard from the Philippians earlier.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have revived your concern for me:</strong> Paul meant “You have shown again that you are concerned for me.” The Philippians had never stopped <u>being</u> concerned about Paul (4:10c) but by their gift they also <u>showed</u> this concern.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>concern:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>concern</em> literally means “to think about someone.” It implies that the Philippians loved Paul and wanted to help him.</p><h4>4:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You were indeed concerned,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I know that you have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> cared about me,</p></li><li><p>I realize that you never stopped thinking about me,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You were indeed concerned:</strong> This phrase clarifies what Paul said in 4:10a–b. He did not want the Philippians to think he was accusing them of neglecting him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>indeed:</strong> The Greek idiom that the BSB translates as <em>indeed</em> literally means “for which.” Here it introduces a phrase to clarify a preceding statement and remove a wrong impression. So it can be translated as “indeed,” “actually” or “I know that.”</p><h4>4:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but you had no opportunity to show it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but you had had no chance to express that concern <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by helping me</span>.</p></li><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">until recently,</span> you had no way to show <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you still cared about me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but you had no opportunity to show it:</strong> One reason why Paul had not received a gift from the Philippians for a long time was probably that they had no way until then to send a gift to him. Finally, they had sent the money with Epaphroditus, who traveled from Philippi to Rome to take it to Paul.</p>",

However, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The first gift Paul received from the Philippians was when he was in Thessalonica (4:16).

See the note on 1:5a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the matter of giving and receiving:</strong> Paul was probably using a business or financial term here that means “in an accounting of expenses and receipts.” He was referring to the gifts of money and perhaps other things that the Philippians had sent to him and his companions. The use of both <em>giving</em> and <em>receiving</em> can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>The Philippians gave and Paul received</u>. The Philippians gave physical (material) gifts to Paul, and he told them that he had received them. <em>(NCV, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p><u>The Philippians both gave and received</u>. They had already received Paul’s gift of the gospel, and, in return, they gave him physical gifts (see 1 Corinthians 9:11). <em>(GW, CEV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either interpretation is possible here, and many English versions are ambiguous. If you need to make explicit who was giving and who was receiving, it is recommended that you follow the first interpretation (1).</p>",

The good things the Philippian believers were doing to help Paul preach the good news were like adding interest to their bank account (that is, putting more money into their account).

He meant that he was not hoping and expecting that the Philippians would send him another gift.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a gift:</strong> It may be helpful to translate this as “another gift,” to indicate that Paul was referring to possible future gifts.</p><h4>4:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but I am looking for the fruit that may be credited to your account.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I want to see <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> bless you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for generously helping me as you have</span>.</p></li><li><p>But I am eager to see <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good acts like</span> this added to the list of good things you have already done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and for which God will reward you</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am looking for the fruit that may be credited to your account:</strong> Paul meant that the main thing he wanted was to see them continue serving the kingdom of God, which would result in God rewarding them.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is the same idea as people “storing up treasures in heaven” (Matthew 6:19–21 and Luke 12:33–34).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the fruit that may be credited to your account:</strong> This is a financial expression referring to profit or interest building up in a bank account.

See the note on 2:25c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your gifts:</strong> The Greek literally means “the things you sent.” Apparently different people from Philippi sent things to help Paul, and this explains why the term <em>gifts</em> is in the plural.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:18b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The three events in this part of the verse actually happened in this order:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the Philippians sent Paul gifts;</p></li><li><p>Epaphroditus handed them to Paul;</p></li><li><p>Paul was amply supplied.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will be necessary to reorder this verse so that the events are in the right order. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You sent me gifts, and Epaphroditus has given them to me. So now I have all that I need.</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It is as if</span> you have given an offering to God that smells sweet. He accepts it and it pleases him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very much</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God:</strong> Paul again thought of the gifts from the Philippians in a collective sense, as a single large gift. He was saying that the help they sent was pleasing to God in the same way that the sort of sacrifice God required was pleasing to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a fragrant offering:</strong> This is literally “an odor of a sweet smell.” It refers to an offering to God that smells good. The Jewish people brought offerings to God as a way of worshiping him. When the priest burned these sacrifices, whether animals or grain and incense, God said that the smell was pleasing to him (See, for example, Leviticus 1:9, 2:1–2). Paul used these Jewish sacrifices as a metaphor for the gift the Philippians had sent. It may be necessary in some languages to translate this as a simile: “Your gift is like a sweet-smelling sacrifice….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an acceptable sacrifice:</strong> Some sacrifices people made to God had something wrong with them or the people who offered them had the wrong attitude, and God did not accept those sacrifices. But God did accept the things the Philippians sent to Paul because they sent them lovingly.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>well-pleasing to God:</strong> God approved of what the Philippians had done and the gifts they had sent to Paul. Their attitude and their gift were right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate 4:18c would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your gifts to me are like the sweet-smelling offerings and sacrifices the priests offer to God. He accepts those offerings and they make him happy.</p></blockquote>",

The Greek probably implies both meanings. It was because of what Jesus had done for them that the Philippian believers belonged to him.

Probably Paul was addressing the church leaders, who would have read the letter first.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all the saints:</strong> See notes on 1:1b for the meaning of <em>saints</em>. Paul wanted to greet every believer in Philippi. In some languages it may be necessary to supply the word “other” to indicate that those who would pass on Paul’s greetings were also Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> There are three main ways that this phrase can be understood here:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It explains the word “saints.” The “saints” are those who are united with or are <em>in Christ Jesus</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings to each one of God’s people who belong to Christ Jesus. (GNT) <em>(GW, NLT, GNT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It relates to the verb “greet.” This would mean, “Greet in Christ Jesus’ name all God’s people.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Give my greetings, in the fellowship of Christ Jesus. (REB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “because of Christ Jesus.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Give my greetings to all who are God’s people because of Christ Jesus.

They also sent their greetings to the believers in Philippi. It does not mean that these believers were with Paul in the Roman prison. But they would have been in the city of Rome. These co-workers were probably all men, and it is not necessary to translate <em>brothers</em> as “brothers and sisters” here.</p>",
