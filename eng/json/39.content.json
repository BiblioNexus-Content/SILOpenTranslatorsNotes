It tells us that this book was a direct message from the LORD to his people, that is, a prophecy. The person through whom the LORD spoke this prophecy was the prophet Malachi.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be better not to put a section heading before the first verse, since the verse itself is a sort of title. See, for example, 1:1 in NIV, GNT, NJB, REB, CEV, NCV, NLT. If that is true in your language, then the first section heading will be the one placed before 1:2.</p></div><h4>1:1</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is the burden of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is</span> a solemn message that Yahweh spoke to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of</span> Israel through Malachi.</p></li><li><p>¶ This is an important message which Yahweh gave/revealed to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me,</span> Malachi, to speak to the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people of</span> Israel.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is the burden of the word of the LORD:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>burden</em> is the word <em>maśśaʾ</em>. In Scripture, it usually refers to prophetic messages or warnings of judgement. It signifies that what follows is important because it is a direct word from God, which the prophet had a strong obligation to announce.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>LORD:</strong> The word <em>LORD</em> represents the Hebrew Yahweh, the personal name of God. In the Hebrew text, this is a proper name, not a title or general noun. See the discussion of Yahweh, the LORD in the “Key biblical terms in the book of Malachi” section of the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to Israel through Malachi:</strong> The word <em>Malachi</em> means “my messenger,” but it is almost certainly used here as the personal name of the prophet. See the discussion of The author in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The writer introduced himself in the third person, as if he were speaking about someone else. The writers of the New Testament letters did this also. Most English versions keep the third person forms. However, if this would be confusing for your readers, you could reword it as the CEV has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am Malachi. And this is the message that the Lord gave me for Israel. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Israel:</strong> This refers to the people who were the descendants of Israel (also known as Jacob). Jacob/Israel was the son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham.</p>",

Some years earlier their enemies, the Babylonians, had defeated them in war and had taken them as slaves to Babylon.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">After some time the people of Israel had been released and were now living again in their own land, but life was very difficult. Perhaps they felt that the LORD had failed to bless them as a nation. They questioned whether the LORD really loved them. The LORD answered this accusation by pointing out that he had chosen to love them more than other nations. He told them that he had shown this love when he chose their ancestor Jacob and entered into a covenant relationship with him and his descendants (Genesis 28:13–15, 35:9–12, 46:3–4).</p></div><h4>1:2a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“I have loved you,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “I have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> loved you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">very much</span>.”</p></li><li><p>¶ “I have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">shown you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I</span> love you<sup>(plur)</sup>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I have loved you:</strong> This is the first of the LORD’s statements of fact.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have loved:</strong> The tense of the verb “love” used here in Hebrew is not limited to present time. It can include past time as well as a present. GNT makes this clear with:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I have always loved you. (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>says the LORD.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are the words of Yahweh.</p></li><li><p>Yahweh has spoken.</p></li><li><p>This is what Yahweh says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>says the LORD:</strong> The speech clause, <em>says the LORD</em> (or “says the LORD of Hosts”), occurs many times throughout the text. This emphasizes repeatedly that this is a direct message from the <em>LORD</em>. See note 1 in “Literary structure and recurring features in Malachi” in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that in the BSB this clause occurs after the speech. This is good English style. You should place your speech clause wherever it would naturally occur in your language.</p><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But you ask, “How have You loved us?”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people of Israel</span> say, “How have you<sup>(sing)</sup> loved us?<sup>(excl)</sup>”</p></li><li><p>But you<sup>(plur)</sup> reply, “What have you<sup>(sing)</sup> done <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to show us</span> that you<sup>(sing)</sup> love us?<sup>(excl)</sup>”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But you ask:</strong> This phrase introduces the first of the objections made by the people of Israel. Most English versions keep the second person pronoun <em>you</em>. This emphasizes the personal relationship which the LORD had with his people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>How have You loved us?:</strong> This question expresses surprise and disbelief.</p><h4>1:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Esau was Jacob’s brother, was he not?” Yahweh says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li><li><p>Yahweh answers, “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">know that</span> Esau was the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">older</span> brother of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ancestor</span> Jacob,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?:</strong> This is a rhetorical question. The LORD was speaking again. By using the question form, the LORD emphasized a fact that the people knew well. Esau and Jacob were children of the same father and the same mother. (In fact, they were twins. See Genesis 25:21–26.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>declares the LORD:</strong> See the note on 1:2b. Notice that in the BSB this speech clause again occurs after the question. This is good English style. You should place it wherever it would naturally occur in your language.</p><h4>1:2e–3a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>loved…hated:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>hated</em> needs to be understood in contrast to the word which the BSB translates as <em>loved</em>. In this context <em>loved</em> means “chosen,” “favored” (as in Deuteronomy 7:7–8; Jeremiah 31:3; Hosea 11:1), while <em>hated</em> is the opposite: “not chosen,” “rejected” or “set aside.” Jacob had been chosen to be the ancestor of the LORD’s special people. By choosing Jacob, the LORD, therefore, was <u>not</u> choosing Jacob’s twin brother, Esau.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be best to use words like “choose” and “reject.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>yet I have accepted Jacob and have rejected Esau. (NJPS)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>yet I chose Jacob, and rejected Esau. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Jacob…Esau:</strong> This verse is not referring only to the individuals, Jacob and Esau, but also to their descendants. Jacob was the ancestor of the nation of Israel, and Esau was the ancestor of a different nation. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2</sup>Esau and Jacob were brothers, but I have loved <u>Jacob and his descendants</u>, <sup>3</sup>and have hated <u>Esau and his descendants</u>. (GNT)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:2e–3a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reverse the order of 1:2e and 1:3a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3a</sup>but it was not Esau whom I chose <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be the ancestor of my people.</span> <sup>2e</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Instead,</span> I chose Jacob <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and his descendants</span>.</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Yet Jacob I have loved,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“but I loved Jacob and chose him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and his descendants to be my people</span></p></li></ul></div>",

Some ways to say this are:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>About six hundred years before the birth of Christ, the Nabatean Arabs gradually took over the land of Edom, driving the Edomites from the area. (Nabaioth, the ancestor of the Nabateans, was the eldest son of Ishmael and therefore grandson of Abraham (Genesis 25:12–13).)

(NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>his mountains:</strong> Esau had already been dead many years before Malachi received this prophecy. The expression which the BSB translates as <em>his mountains</em> refers to the hilly region where Esau’s descendants lived.</p><h4>1:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I have left that desert land to jackals <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as their home</span>.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">So</span> that region now belongs to the wild animals.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>inheritance:</strong> This refers to the land of Edom, that is, the land where Esau and his descendants had formerly lived. The LORD had given them that land, but later he had taken it from them because of what they had done to the people of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Edomites consistently opposed the Israelites on many occasions through history. In 589–587 BC they joined with the Babylonians to fight against the people of Judah, and to destroy Jerusalem. (See the book of Obadiah, especially verses 10–14.) About six hundred years before the birth of Christ, the Nabatean Arabs gradually took over the land of Edom, driving the Edomites from the area. (Nabaioth, the ancestor of the Nabateans, was the eldest son of Ishmael and therefore grandson of Abraham (Genesis 25:12–13).) This had already happened by the time that Malachi was writing.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>desert jackals:</strong> The <em>desert jackals</em> mentioned here are wild animals of the dog family (similar to wolves).

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“…you will say, ‘Truly, the Lord’s great power reaches far beyond our borders!’” (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NJB, REB, NET, GW, NCV, CEV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>They are Malachi’s words. The LORD’s words end in 1:4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>“<sup>4h</sup>…the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever.” <sup>5a</sup>Your own eyes shall see this… (RSV) <em>(RSV, GNT, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). It is likely that this verse is a continuation of what the LORD was saying to the people of Israel. This fits with the rest of the chapter, which is a conversation between the LORD and various groups of people. Therefore include these words in the quotation that you started in 1:4, so that you make it clear that the LORD was still speaking.</p><h4>1:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>You will see this with your own eyes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people of Israel</span> will see this happening with your<sup>(plur)</sup> own eyes,</p></li><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> yourselves will see this.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>You will see this with your own eyes:</strong> This clause emphasizes that the people of Israel would actually <u>see</u> these things happen to the Edomites. Another way to express this emphasis in English is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You yourselves will see this.</p></blockquote><h4>1:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and you yourselves will say, ‘The LORD is great—even beyond the borders of Israel.’”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and you<sup>(plur)</sup> will say, ‘Yahweh is powerful/mighty <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in every place/nation,</span> even beyond the boundaries of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of</span> Israel.’ ”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The LORD is great—even beyond the borders of Israel:</strong> This means that the greatness of the LORD extends beyond the land of Israel. He is powerful over many nations. The verb or adjective form of the Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>great</em> is also used in 1:11 (twice) and 1:14. All these verses refer to the fact that the power of the LORD is not limited to the people of Israel. His power extends to other nations as well. See also the note on 1:11.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:5b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:5b, the LORD was quoting what the people themselves would say. In some languages it may not be possible to use direct speech here. One way to use indirect speech instead is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and you<sup>(plur)</sup> shall say <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that</span> the LORD is great <span data-bnType=\"implied\">even</span> beyond the border of Israel!</p></blockquote></div>",

And if I am a master, where is your fear of Me?:</strong> These two questions are <u>rhetorical questions</u>. Their functions are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>to show that honor is unquestionably due to the LORD,</p></li><li><p>to rebuke the hearers,</p></li><li><p>and to introduce the topic about which the LORD would speak.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to change the form of the question so that the same functions are communicated. For example, GNT uses a more natural English style:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>why don’t you honor me?…why don’t you respect me? (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be better to use statements rather than questions to communicate these functions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>honor:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>kabod</em> which the BSB translates as <em>honor</em> is used frequently in the Hebrew Bible to talk about God’s glory and majesty. It also means “dignity.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your fear of Me:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>moraʾ</em> which the BSB translates as <em>fear</em> can also mean “reverence,” “awe.” So it is translated in many English versions as “respect.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:6a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the two pairs of parallel statements 1:6a–b and 1:6c–d. Twice the text uses two similar statements together for emphasis. This increases the impact on the hearer, and it highlights an important point:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>A <u>son</u> honors his <u>father</u>, and</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>a <u>servant</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">honors</span> his <u>master</u>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6c</sup>But if I am a <u>father</u>, where is My <u>honor</u>?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6d</sup>And if I am a <u>master</u>, where is your <u>fear</u> of Me?</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:6e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are the words of Yahweh Sabaot</p></li><li><p>Yahweh Sabaot has spoken.</p></li><li><p>This is what Yahweh Sabaot says</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts:</strong> The speech clause, <em>says the LORD of Hosts</em> (or “says the LORD”), occurs many times throughout the text. This emphasizes the fact that this is a direct message from the LORD. See note 1 in “Literary structure and recurring features in Malachi” in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that in the BSB this clause occurs after the speech. This is good English style. However GNT placed this phrase at the beginning of the verse to make it clear who is speaking and to whom:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The Lord Almighty says to the priests… (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You should place it wherever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD of Hosts:</strong> See the note on 1:4d concerning this special title for the LORD. Translate it in the same way here.</p><h4>1:6f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:6f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to you priests who despise My name.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to you<sup>(plur)</sup> priests, who insult my name.</p></li><li><p>“You<sup>(plur)</sup> priests treat my authority with contempt.</p></li><li><p>to you<sup>(plur)</sup>, the priests, who treat me as if I am nothing.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you priests:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates <em>you priests</em> is a <u>vocative</u>—the LORD was addressing the priests directly. In some languages vocative phrases are usually placed at the beginning of the sentence. You should place the phrase where it would be natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>priests:</strong> The main function of a Jewish priest was to be the mediator between the people and the LORD, and make sacrifices to the LORD on behalf of the people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who despise My name:</strong> By describing the priests this way, the text summarizes their failure to honor the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>despise:</strong> The Hebrew verb which the BSB translates as <em>despise</em> means “to hold in contempt,” that is, to consider something unimportant.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My name:</strong> In the Hebrew Bible, the phrase “the LORD’s name” or <em>My name</em> refers to the LORD himself or his authority.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (1972), page 225; Merrill (1994), page 401.</span></span> When the priests despised the <em>name</em> of the LORD, they were despising the LORD himself and treating him with contempt.

Its function is to disagree with the LORD’s statement. The priests were claiming that they had not despised the LORD’s name. If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, it may be necessary to express the idea with a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Yet you say, “We have not despised your name.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In this statement the LORD quoted the priests’ words. In some languages it may be more natural to use indirect speech for the statement. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Yet you claim that you have not despised my name.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Your name:</strong> The Hebrew phrase which the BSB translates as <em>Your name</em> refers to the LORD himself or his authority.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (1972), page 225; Merrill (1994), page 401.</span></span> See also the note on 1:6f. When the priests despised the <em>name</em> of the LORD, they were despising the LORD himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">GNT simply uses “you” instead of <em>Your name</em>. You may also do this if it would be clearer in your translation.</p>",

GNT begins this verse with the phrase “This is how,” to make this connection explicit. It may be necessary in your language to do something similar.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>By presenting:</strong> In Hebrew this literally is “you are bringing.” When used with “upon my altar,” this is the normal expression for bringing sacrifices to the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>defiled food:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>defiled</em> can also be translated as “polluted.” Although GNT uses the word “worthless,” the meaning here is not that the sacrifices had little value. Instead, it means that the sacrifices were “ritually unclean,” “unholy,” and therefore unfit to be used as a sacrifice to the LORD. In the laws which the LORD had given to Moses many years previously, he said that animals offered for sacrifice must be perfect. See Exodus 12:5; Leviticus 1:3, 1:10, 22:18–25; Deuteronomy 15:21.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>food:</strong> This is the general word in Hebrew for “bread,” “food” or “grain,” but here it refers to animal sacrifices, as 1:8 makes clear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on My altar:</strong> The altar is the place where the priest burned the sacrifice. The altar was a large structure, shaped like a box, made of bronze. It stood in the temple outside the Holy Place.</p><h4>1:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But you ask, ‘How have we defiled You?’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do this, and</span> yet you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still</span> ask, ‘How have we<sup>(excl)</sup> dishonored you?<sup>(sing)</sup>’</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">do this,</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still</span> say/claim that you<sup>(plur)</sup> have not defiled me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>How have we defiled You?:</strong> There is a textual issue with this verse. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Hebrew text reads: “How have we polluted <u>you</u>?” <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, CEV, GW, NET, REB, NASB, KJV, NJPS)</em></p></li><li><p>The LXX reads, “How have we polluted <u>it</u>?” <em>(RSV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1) and the Hebrew text. This again shows that “the name” in 1:6g stands for the LORD himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This statement is parallel to “How have we despised Your name?” in 1:6g. This is another rhetorical question. The people again objected to the LORD saying that they had treated him badly. Use the appropriate grammatical form in your language to show this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>defiled:</strong> In some languages it may not be natural to speak of “defiling” God. The idea is that they were dishonoring him. They did that by bringing defective offerings. It may be necessary to express the idea in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How have we failed to respect you? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>How have we offended you? (NET)</p></blockquote><h4>1:7c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:7c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>By saying that the table of the LORD is contemptible.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You<sup>(plur)</sup> act as if my altar is not worthy to be respected.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is how you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have insulted me:</span> You<sup>(plur)</sup> think that it is proper/fitting to take things that are unacceptable and offer them to me Yahweh.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">This clause is the answer to the question in 1:7b. In some languages it may be necessary to make this connection more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have done it by… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the table of the LORD:</strong> This refers to the altar on which sacrifices were offered to the <em>LORD</em> in the temple. This is a figure of speech which refers to the whole act of offering sacrifices to the <em>LORD</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that the LORD referred to his own altar as <em>the table of the LORD</em>. In some languages this may be confusing. If that is true in your language, you may substitute a first person form like “my.” GNT has “my altar.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>contemptible:</strong> The Hebrew word is related to the word translated as “despised” in 1:6. See the note on 1:6f above.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:6–7</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the special structure in 1:6–7. This highlights an important point in the text.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6g</sup>But you ask, ‘How have we <u>despised</u> Your name?’</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup>By presenting <u>defiled</u> food on <u>My altar</u>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7b</sup>But you ask, ‘How have we <u>defiled</u> You?’</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7c</sup>By saying that <u>the table of the LORD</u> is <u>contemptible</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The same Hebrew verb <em>bazah</em> “to despise, to treat with contempt” appears in verse parts 1:6g and 1:7c, where the BSB translates it as “contemptible.” The verse parts 1:7a and 1:7b contain the Hebrew verb <em>gaʾal</em>, which means “to pollute, to defile, to make unclean or unholy.”</p></div>",

By doing this they showed that they did not respect or honor him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This part of the speech was addressed most strongly to the priests. However Malachi 1:13–14 shows that the people were included too.</p></div><h4>1:9</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars do not agree as to who is speaking in 1:9. There are three main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Both Malachi and the LORD speak in 1:9. In 1:9a it was Malachi himself who was appealing to the priests to repent. In 1:9b–c it was the LORD who was speaking. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But now plead for God’s favor that he might be gracious to us. “With this kind of thing in your hands, how can he be pleased with you?” asks the sovereign Lord. (NET) <em>This fits with the use of the Hebrew first person pronoun “us” in 1:9a and with the speech clause “said the LORD of hosts” at the end of the verse.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The LORD himself spoke <u>all</u> the words of 1:9. The main problem with this interpretation is the use of the first person pronoun “us” in 1:9a, which is not translated in the BSB. <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NASB)</em> <em>Some versions follow the LXX and use “you” here to avoid this problem.</em> <em>(CEV, GW, REB, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>Malachi spoke all 1:9 as a comment. This fits with the pronoun “us” and the third person reference to God in 1:9c.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are other precedents for the use of the third person to refer to himself in the words that the LORD, so this in itself does not prove that the LORD is not speaking here. But the use of the first person pronoun “us” seems to be fairly conclusive evidence that the prophet is speaking at this point.</span></span> But the use of the speech clause “says the LORD of hosts” in 1:9d seems to contradict this interpretation. GNT follows this interpretation, but only by moving the speech clause out of 1:9 altogether:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>8f,g</sup>“Would he be pleased with you or grant you any favors?” <sup>9</sup>Now, you priests, try asking God to be good to us. He will not answer your prayer, and it will be your fault. <sup>10</sup>The Lord Almighty says, “I wish one of you would close…” (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). See the Meaning Line in the Display for an example of this interpretation.</p><h4>1:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“But ask now for God’s favor. Will He be gracious?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And yet you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bring that kind of gift to God and</span> beg God/him to be kind/good to us<sup>(incl)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But ask now for God’s favor. Will He be gracious?:</strong> Most English versions and some commentators interpret this sentence as irony. This could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What good will it do if you entreat the favor of God, when you keep on doing the kind of things you are doing?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Go ahead, beg God to be merciful to you! But when you bring that kind of offering, why should he show you any favor at all? (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The preceding and following contexts are then ironical. In other words, they were a strong rebuke to the priests because they were being hypocritical: they begged for mercy but at the same time offered unclean sacrifices.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some versions (REB) and commentators interpret 1:9a as a genuine appeal to the priests to repent, offering the expectation that the Lord will have mercy. But this is a minority view.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ask:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>ask</em> means “to pray, beg, plead, entreat.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God:</strong> This is one of the few places in the book in which the general term for God, <em>ʾel</em>, is used, rather than the personal name Yahweh. This may be because of the contrast between God and a human governor (1:8e).</p><h4>1:9b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verse parts the LORD asked a rhetorical question. He used this question to rebuke the priests and to emphasize that he would not bless them when they brought improper offerings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, it may be necessary to use a statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If you despise him by bringing such offerings, he certainly will not show you favor!</p></blockquote><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Since this has come from your hands,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“When you<sup>(plur)</sup> give him such gifts,</p></li><li><p>“If you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">despise him by</span> bringing such offerings,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Since this has come from your hands:</strong> The Hebrew phrase which the BSB translates as <em>come from your hands</em> literally means “this is from your hand.” There are two main ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“This” refers to the offerings of maimed animals described in 1:8. In other words, “if you bring him that kind of an offering…” In this context <em>from your hands</em> means “from you.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But when you bring that kind of offering… (NLT) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NLT, NCV, NET, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The statement, “this is from your hand,” means “this is your fault,” or “this is your responsibility.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and it will be your fault. (GNT) <em>(GNT, CEV, NJPS, GW, NRSV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For discussion of other possible interpretations, see Pohlig (1998), pages 44–46.

In some languages this may be confusing. If that is true in your language, it may be necessary to indicate that the LORD was referring to himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>how can <u>I</u> show favor to any of you?</p></blockquote><h4>1:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>asks the LORD of Hosts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are the words of Yahweh Sabaot.</p></li><li><p>Yahweh Sabaot has spoken.</p></li><li><p>This is what Yahweh Sabaot says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>asks the LORD of Hosts:</strong> See the note on 1:6e.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD of Hosts:</strong> See the note on 1:4d and 1:6e.

However Malachi 1:13–14 shows that the people were included too.</p></div><h4>1:11</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The theme of 1:11 is the greatness of the LORD and the fact that he is honored among the nations. This theme returns to the theme which was introduced in 1:5 and will be repeated again in 1:14. This is the reason that the LORD made his covenant with the people of Israel, so that through them people of all nations would come to know him.</p><h4>1:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For My name will be great among the nations,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For my name is respected/known-as-great by the peoples <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the earth</span></p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Surely people of all</span> nations honor me/my name.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>ki</em> which the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces a general reason that the LORD will not accept their offerings. In some languages this reason may not be obvious. The text implies that because the LORD is very great and worshipped throughout the world, he would not accept their offerings that showed disrespect for him. Many English versions translate this Hebrew word as “for.” Some versions omit it. Use what would be natural in your language in this context to state the reason that the LORD did not accept their offerings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>My name will be great among the nations:</strong> There is no verb in the Hebrew text of 1:11a. However in English a verb is required. Most versions have chosen a form of the verb “to be.” However they differ in the tense they choose:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some versions use the present tense “is.” <em>(RSV, GNT, NJB, CEV, REB, NLT, NJPS)</em></p></li><li><p>Other versions use the future tense “will be.” <em>(BSB, NIV, NCV, GW, NASB, KJV, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either tense is possible from the Hebrew. If there is a way to maintain this ambiguity of tense in your translation, do so. But if you must choose a verb tense, it is recommended that you follow option (1) and use the present tense.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This probably refers to the fact that some people from other nations were beginning to believe in and follow Yahweh, the God of the people of Israel.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>However there is also a future, prophetic meaning that points to those people from all nations who were going to believe in God in the future (Baldwin (1972), pages 228–230).</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the nations:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>goyim</em> which the BSB translates as <em>nations</em> was the word which the Jews used to refer to the Gentiles, the people of all the other nations.</p><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>from where the sun rises to where it sets.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from the east to the west.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">in every part of the world,</span> from where the sun rises to where it sets.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>from where the sun rises to where it sets:</strong> This is a figure of speech.

By doing this they showed that they did not respect or honor him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This part of the speech was addressed most strongly to the priests. However Malachi 1:13–14 shows that the people were included too.</p></div><h4>1:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“But you profane it</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“But you<sup>(plur)</sup> insult my name</p></li><li><p>“But you<sup>(plur)</sup>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">priests,</span> you<sup>(plur)</sup> do not honor me/my name</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But you:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> is emphatic here and refers to the priests. The disrespectful actions of the priests are contrasted with the respect that other nations gave to the LORD (1:11).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>profane:</strong> The verb which the BSB translates as <em>profane</em> means “profane, dishonor, treat as unholy/common.” The same verb is used in 2:10d and 2:11c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it:</strong> There is a textual issue in this verse. Scholars do not agree about whether the object of “profane” should be “it” or “me.” So there are two options:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The object should be “it.” The pronoun “it” refers to the LORD’s name. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you are profaning it. (NET) <em>(BSB, RSV, NIV, NJB, NET, NLT, NJPS, NASB, KJV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The object should be “me,” that is, the LORD. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you don’t honor me. (NCV) <em>(GNT, NCV, CEV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1), as it seems to be the more likely solution to the textual issue.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However there is very little difference in meaning between the two options. The pronoun <em>it</em> here refers to the LORD’s name, and the LORD’s name is a way to refer to the LORD himself. Therefore, it is acceptable to follow option (2) if it would be more natural and clearer in your language.</p><h4>1:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when you say, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>when you<sup>(plur)</sup> say that it does not matter what kind of sacrifices you<sup>(plur)</sup> offer to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span>, the Lord/Master.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The table of the Lord:</strong> This is the altar on which sacrifices were offered to God in the temple. This is a figure of speech for the whole act of offering sacrifices to God. See the note on 1:7c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> here is <em>ʾadonay</em>. This title refers to God as “lord/master.” It is different from his personal name Yahweh. Both terms refer to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that in 1:7c, the Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as “table of the LORD” does indeed use Yahweh. So 1:7c and 1:12b differ in the Hebrew text. Try to preserve this distinction in your translation. See the discussion of these terms in the Key biblical terms in the book of Malachi section in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>defiled:</strong> This is the same verb as in 1:7a and 1:7b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:12b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that the LORD continued to refer to himself as though he were talking about someone else. If that is confusing in your language, it may be necessary to indicate that he was talking about himself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you dishonor me when you say that <u>my</u> altar is worthless and when you offer on it food that you despise. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But you insult me when you say that it does not matter what kind of sacrifices you offer to <u>me, the Lord</u>.</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and as for its fruit, its food is contemptible.’</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bring sacrifices of</span> food that are worthless/not-acceptable <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and give them to me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and as for its fruit, its food is contemptible:</strong> That is, it does not matter what kind of worthless food/offering you bring to give to God. The <em>food</em> spoken of here is the meat (animal) and cereal offerings which the priests placed upon the altar.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>contemptible:</strong> This is the same Hebrew verb as in 1:6f, 1:7c, also 2:9a.</p>",

It is preceded by the conjunction <em>w-</em>, usually translated as “and.” The LORD used this expression to introduce the next things he would say. It emphasizes that these things were important. In some languages, it may not be natural to use a time word to express this meaning.

Unlike most verses in Hebrew, this one does not begin with a connector. However in some languages it may be helpful to use a transition phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Because of you</u> I will rebuke your descendants. (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Behold:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>hinneh</em> which the BSB translates as <em>Behold</em> is difficult to translate. Many English versions leave it untranslated because it has no equivalent in English (NIV, GNT, NJPS, NRSV, NCV, GW, REB, NLT, CEV).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The usual function of <em>hinneh</em> is to direct the attention of the reader or listener to what follows.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Hebrew word expresses “the immediacy, the here-and-now-ness of the situation” (Lambdin 1971, page 168).</span></span> Here, the LORD described what would happen immediately. Try to find a way to produce this effect in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>Now</u>, I <u>am going to</u> break… (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I <u>am about to</u> discipline… (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will rebuke your descendants:</strong> That is, I will punish your descendants.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>descendants:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>descendants</em> literally means “seed.” Most versions and commentators understand this to refer to the descendants of the priests.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There are a number of interpretation difficulties in this verse of which the most important arise from the fact that the word translated “offspring” is literally “seed.” The NJPS translation, “I will put your seed under a ban,” seems to interpret this to mean literal seed. Rebuking “the seed” would then mean “causing their crops to fail” or “damaging their crops.” There is a full discussion of this in Glazier-McDonald (1987).</span></span></p><h4>2:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and I will spread dung on your faces, the waste from your feasts,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I will rub your<sup>(plur)</sup> faces in the excrement <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the intestines</span> of the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">animals</span> that you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bring and</span> sacrifice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span>,</p></li><li><p>I will take <span data-bnType=\"implied\">some</span> excrement <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from the intestines</span> of the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">animals</span> that you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">bring and</span> sacrifice <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span> and rub it on your<sup>(plur)</sup> faces.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will spread dung on your faces:</strong> This is a shocking picture. The LORD was saying that he would rub the faces of the priests in or with the excrement of the animals they sacrificed. This, of course, would make the priests ritually unclean and unable to serve the LORD in his temple and to offer sacrifices there.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dung:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>pereš</em> which the BSB translates as <em>dung</em> refers to the excrement that came from the intestines of a sacrificed animal. These were the parts of the animal which were considered unclean and which were to be taken outside the temple and burnt. See Exodus 29:14; Leviticus 4:11, 8:17, 16:27; Numbers 19:5.</p><h4>2:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and you will be carried off with it.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also send you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">away, and</span> throw you<sup>(plur)</sup> out with the rubbish/dung.</p></li><li><p>I will remove you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from serving me</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the same way that you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">dispose of</span> the animal excrement.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will be carried off with it:</strong> The Hebrew clause which the BSB translates as <em>you will be carried off with it</em> literally means “and someone/he will carry you off with it.” Here the LORD referred to the custom of taking unacceptable parts of sacrificed animals outside the camp to be thrown away or burned. He implied that the priests were of no value to him and would be carried away with these unacceptable, useless things.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The LORD probably did not mean that he would literally cause the priests to be taken to the dung heap. This was an emphatic way to say that he would remove them from their work just like they removed the excrement and disposed of it. There are two possibilities for translation:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use the figure explicitly.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…splatter your faces with the dung of your festival sacrifices, <u>and I will add you to the dung heap</u>. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…the excrement from your festival sacrifices. <u>You will be discarded with it</u>. (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT, GNT, GW, NJPS, NJB, NCV, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Omit the figure in 2:3c and translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and I shall banish you from my presence. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and then be done with you. (CEV) <em>(RSV, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the option that communicates best in your language.</p>",

However the reference here is not to Levi himself. It refers to his descendants, the priests of earlier days, who obeyed the LORD. GNT uses the plural form in this paragraph and in the following verses to indicate that the verses refer to more than one person. Similarly, the NCV translates this reference to Levi in 2:5 as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My agreement for priests was with the tribe of Levi. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You should consider if you should do the same in your translation. Make sure that you are consistent in your use of singular or plural pronouns in this section.</p></div><h4>2:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“My covenant with him was one of life and peace,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “The covenant that I made with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Levi</span> was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give</span> him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and his descendants</span> life and well-being</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh also says</span>: “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">Long ago</span> when I made that covenant with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the descendants of Levi</span>, I promised <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that I would give them</span> peace/well-being</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>one of life and peace:</strong> That is, a covenant through which Levi’s descendants would receive life and live in peace/security.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>shalom</em> which the BSB translates as <em>peace</em> means much more than the English word “peace.” It can refer to the state of blessing that results from someone living according to the LORD’s will. This <em>peace</em> included feeling well and whole. See also 2:6c.</p><h4>2:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which I gave to him;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I gave that to him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and his descendants</span>,</p></li><li><p>and I did as I had promised them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which I gave to him:</strong> That is, I did as I had promised him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>which:</strong> That is, life and peace.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>him:</strong> That is, Levi (and his descendants).</p><h4>2:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>it called for reverence,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that he might revere <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I did this</span> so that they might revere/honor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it called for reverence:</strong> Scholars disagree about the way this clause relates to 2:5b. There are at least three views:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It expresses purpose. The LORD gave Levi and his descendants a covenant of life and peace so that they might respect the LORD. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and this is what I gave them, so that they might respect me. (GNT) <em>(GNT, RSV, NCV, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It expresses the covenant’s requirements. In other words, the LORD’s covenant of life and peace gave them the responsibility to revere the LORD and his covenant. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This called for reverence from them. (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NLT, CEV, REB, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It expresses the type of covenant, just as “life and peace” do. In other words, it was a covenant of reverence towards him, as well as life and peace. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>My covenant was with him—a covenant of life and peace, and these were what I gave him—<u>a covenant of respect</u>… (NJB) <em>(NJB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reverence:</strong> The purpose of the covenant (2:5a) was to cause Levi and his descendants to respect and revere the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note on 1:6c–d. The same Hebrew word is translated as “reverence&quot; here. If possible, use the same expression in both verses.</p><h4>2:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and he revered Me</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And he did revere me</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Indeed,</span> they did revere/honor me</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he revered Me:</strong> The Hebrew verb which the BSB translates as <em>revered</em> is a different form of the same verb which was used in 2:5c. This repetition of the verb emphasizes it. In some languages it may be necessary to change the second expression in some way to make it natural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and of reverence, <u>which he showed Me</u>. (NJPS)</p></blockquote><h4>2:5e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and stood in awe of My name.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and respected my-name/me.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>stood in awe of My name:</strong> That is, he respected/feared me greatly. Here again, the subject of the verb is singular, but it refers to both Levi and his descendants.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My name:</strong> In the Hebrew Bible, the phrase “the LORD’s name” or <em>My name</em> refers to God himself or his authority.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (1972), page 225; Merrill (1994), page 401.</span></span> It was also used in this way in 1:6. See the note on 1:6f. GNT uses “me” instead of <em>My name</em> to make this clear.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:5d–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">These two verse parts are parallel and have similar meanings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he <u>revered</u> <u>Me</u>,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and <u>stood in awe</u> of <u>My name</u>.</p></blockquote></div>",

That is, people were going to consider the priests to be vile, to have a shameful character.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are at least two possibilities for translating these two verbs:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the implied passive. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I…have made you contemptible and vile <u>to the whole people</u>. (NJB)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make the idea active with a subject like “people.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I…will make <u>the people of Israel</u> despise you. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an option which is natural in your language to express the meaning.</p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because you have not kept My ways,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you<sup>(plur)</sup> did not follow my instructions/laws,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will do this</span> because you<sup>(plur)</sup> did not do what I told you<sup>(plur)</sup> to do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as <em>because</em> means “to the extent that.” Here it compares 2:9a with 2:9b. The LORD will cause the priests to be despised <u>to the extent that</u> they have not kept his ways and have shown partiality in their instruction. In this verse, the expression acts like a reason connector.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Use what would be natural in your language in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you have not kept My ways:</strong> That is, you have not obeyed my instructions/laws. The same Hebrew word for <em>ways</em> was used in 2:8a.</p><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but instead you<sup>(plur)</sup> are unfair in the way you<sup>(plur)</sup> apply <span data-bnType=\"implied\">my law</span>.”</p></li><li><p>and you<sup>(plur)</sup> have not treated people fairly/alike as you<sup>(plur)</sup> were instructing them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about my law</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but have shown partiality in matters of the law:</strong> This part of the verse indicates that the priests were unfair to certain people in the way that they applied the law of God when they made decisions. For example, as priests, they decided whether an animal was too blemished to be acceptable for sacrifice. When they made such decisions, they treated some people better than others. Some ways to express this in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You have been unfair when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">applying</span> my teachings. (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you…have shown partiality in your interpretation of the law. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you…show partiality in your rulings. (NJPS)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>matters of the law:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>matters of the law</em> is the same word that was translated as “instruction&quot; in 2:6a, 2:7b, 2:8b. Here it refers specifically to the way that the priests interpreted God’s law as they made decisions that affected people’s lives.</p>",

It highlights its main theme: that is, that both the priests and the people had been unfaithful to the LORD. The LORD here called them to repent and to follow him again.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section lists three specific ways in which the people of Israel as a nation had broken their covenant with the LORD:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They had married wives who worshipped foreign gods.</p></li><li><p>They had been unfaithful to their wives.</p></li><li><p>They had even divorced their wives.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Also the people had been hypocritical. They asked the LORD to help them in order to show that they trusted him. Yet, at the same time, they continued to be unfaithful to him and to disobey him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Hebrew word <em>bagad</em> which means “faithless, treacherous” occurs five times in these verses. The repeated use of the word highlights both the unfaithfulness of the people to the LORD and their unfaithfulness to their wives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section contains one of the few places in the book in which it was the prophet himself who addressed the people. The prophet rebuked the people of Israel because they had been unfaithful to the LORD. He began his rebuke with a series of rhetorical questions. The first two questions in this section form a doublet, which makes an emphatic beginning, and all the questions indicate strong feeling.</p></div><h4>2:10</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">As stated in the introduction to this section, in this verse and those following, it is the prophet himself who was speaking. The content of 2:10 makes this clear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">However there is no marker in Hebrew to indicate that it is no longer the LORD who was speaking (1:2–2:9) but Malachi. In some languages it may be necessary to make this explicit in some way. There are at least three possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Indicate it in the section heading, as the section heading in these Notes has done:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Malachi rebuked the people of Israel because they had been unfaithful to the LORD.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a footnote to explain that 2:10–15 are the words of Malachi.</p></li><li><p>Make it explicit in the text. For example, you could begin 2:10 with a phrase like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These are the words of Malachi:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I, Malachi, ask you:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Malachi said:</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Use the option which is most appropriate in your language.</p><h4>2:10a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do we not all have one Father?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Do we<sup>(incl)</sup> not all have one father?</p></li><li><p>¶ We<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the people of Israel</span> all have one father, do we<sup>(incl)</sup> not?</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">know that</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> all have one father, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh,</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do we not all have one Father?:</strong> Here <em>we</em> refers to the people of Israel, not to human beings in general.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (1972), page 237; Merrill (1994), page 414; Redditt (1995), page 170.</span></span> Malachi identified himself with the rest of the people of Israel when he used the pronoun <em>we</em> here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is the first rhetorical question which Malachi himself used. He wanted to emphasize what he was saying by asserting something that his hearers all knew to be true. The question expects the answer “yes.” If you do not use rhetorical questions like this in your language, you can reword it as a strong positive statement. Here is one example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know</span> that we all have one Father.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one Father:</strong> This refers to God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators argue that “one father” may refer to Abraham (Baldwin 1972, page 237), or Jacob, or even to Levi. The evidence for interpreting the reference to be to God is, however, convincing:(a) God has already been referred to as “father” in 1:6.(b) “father” is parallel with “God” in the parallelism:have we not all one father?has not one God created us?This is also consistent with other Scriptures where the parallel ideas of God as Father and Creator are found (Deuteronomy 32:6). See further the discussion in Keil and Delitzsch (1950), page 448, and Merrill (1994), page 414, also Redditt (1995), page 170.</span></span> The CEV makes this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t you know that we all have God as our Father? (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>2:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Did not one God create us?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Did not one God create us?<sup>(incl)</sup></p></li><li><p>The same God created us<sup>(incl)</sup> all, did he not?</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">know that</span> the same God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh,</span> created us<sup>(incl)</sup> all.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Did not one God create us?:</strong> This is Malachi’s second rhetorical question and again it expects the answer “yes.” One way to express this as a positive statement would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You know</span> that the same God created us.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:10a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that 2:10a and 2:10b say almost the same thing. The ideas are also arranged in a special pattern called a “chiasm.”</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Do <u>we</u> not all have <u>one Father</u>?</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Did not <u>one God</u> create <u>us</u>?</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The parallelism and the chiasm indicate that these verse parts express an important idea in the text.</p></div><h4>2:10c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars interpret the connection between 2:10c and 2:10d in at least three ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The statement in 2:10d explains the <u>result</u> of the people’s unfaithfulness to each other in 2:10c. They were unfaithful to each other, and, as a result, they profaned the covenant. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother <u>so as to</u> profane the covenant of our fathers? (NASB) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, NASB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The statements in 2:10c and 2:10d are <u>two different ways</u> that the people were displeasing God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then why do we break our promises to one another, <u>and</u> why do we despise the covenant that God made with our ancestors? (GNT) <em>(GNT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The statement in 2:10d indicates <u>the way that</u> the people had been unfaithful. They had been unfaithful by profaning the covenant. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then why do you cheat each other <u>by</u> breaking the agreement God made with your ancestors? (CEV) <em>(CEV, KJV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions are ambiguous about the connection. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">See also the general comment on 2:10c–d for a reordering suggestion.</p><h4>2:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Why then do we break faith with one another</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then why do we<sup>(incl)</sup> betray one another,</p></li><li><p>But we<sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still</span> are unfaithful to each other,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Why then do we break faith with one another…?:</strong> That is, why do we (the people of Israel) not keep our commitments and promises to one another? This rhetorical question introduces the following verses, which describe ways that the people of Israel had been unfaithful to God’s commands. They had also been unfaithful to each other, especially in breaking their marriage vows.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>then:</strong> The BSB has included the word <em>then</em> to show the relationship between 2:10c and the preceding questions in 2:10a–b. Those questions imply that the people should have been united because God was the father and creator of all of them. However 2:10c states that instead they were unfaithful to each other. Malachi did not expect them to act that way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to make the expectation explicit. Languages have different ways to show that something was different from what the speaker expected. Here are some possibilities for translation:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a connector which implies this. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>So</u> why do people break their promises to each other…? (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Refer to the preceding question to show the connection. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Since that is true</u>, why are we unfaithful to each other?</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Make Malachi’s expectation explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because of this, you should have been faithful to each other.</span> Why have you been unfaithful <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead</span>…?</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the option which is most appropriate in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>break faith:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>bagad</em> which the BSB translates as <em>break faith</em> is the key word in this section. See the discussion at the beginning of Section 2:10–16. This word describes the way the people of Israel behaved in all their relationships:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>they broke their promises to each other (2:10),</p></li><li><p>they broke their promises to their wives (2:14–15) and</p></li><li><p>they broke their covenant with God himself (2:11).</p></li></ol><h4>2:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and so break the covenant that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh made</span> with our<sup>(incl)</sup> ancestors?</p></li><li><p>and as a result, we<sup>(incl)</sup> violate/disobey/disregard the covenant which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh made</span> with our<sup>(incl)</sup> ancestors?</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by this unfaithfulness,</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> break the covenant that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh made</span> with our<sup>(incl)</sup> ancestors!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so as to profane the covenant of our fathers:</strong> This statement explains the result of 2:10c. When the people were unfaithful to each other, they profaned the covenant.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>profane:</strong> That is, disregard/disobey/violate.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the covenant of our fathers:</strong> This refers to the covenant which God made with the ancestors of the people of Israel. It may be necessary to make this explicit in some translations. This has been done in 2:10d in the Display.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:10c–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to change the order of these verse parts. Notice that it may be necessary then to use a different connector between 2:10c and 2:10d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>10d</sup>Why do we profane the covenant of our fathers <sup>10c</sup>by breaking faith with one another? (NIV)</p></blockquote></div>",

They had worshipped other gods (idols). The Hebrew verb which the BSB translates as <em>has broken faith</em> is the same verb (<em>bagad</em>) which was used in 2:10 to describe the people’s unfaithfulness to each other.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Judah:</strong> Here <em>Judah</em> is another way to refer to people who were descendants of Judah’s father, Israel (who was also called Jacob).</p><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>A revolting/disgusting thing has been done in Jerusalem and in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the land of</span> Israel.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(incl)</sup> have done something that is revolting/disgusting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the city of</span> Jerusalem and in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the rest of</span> Israel.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an abomination has been committed:</strong> That is, a terrible, disgusting thing has been done. If you need to use an active verb you could say: “The people have done a terrible thing.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Israel:</strong> This refers to the land of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Jerusalem:</strong> The city of Jerusalem was in the land of Israel. In some languages it may be better to mention it before Israel is mentioned, as, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Jerusalem and in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the whole region</span> of Israel.</p></blockquote><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For Judah has profaned the LORD’s beloved sanctuary</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> have defiled the temple of Yahweh, which he loves</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>ki</em> which the BSB translates as <em>For</em> has many uses. Here it introduces a specific act that was part of the general action which Malachi mentioned in 2:11b. There he said that an abomination had been committed; in this part of the verse he explained what the abomination was. Express this connection in an appropriate way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Judah has profaned:</strong> The Hebrew verb which the BSB translates as <em>has profaned</em> is the same verb which was used in 1:12a and 2:10d. Here its use is similar to 1:12a, where it means to “dishonor, treat as unholy/common.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the LORD’s beloved sanctuary:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>sanctuary</em> is the noun <em>qodeš</em>. This literally means “holiness.” Here most English versions agree that it refers to the temple, the sanctuary of the LORD.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Commentators have suggested four main interpretations:(1) It refers to the sanctuary of the LORD. This is the view followed by most English versions. It is also supported by Redditt (1995), pages 170–171; Smith 1984, pages 319, 322, Glazier-McDonald 1987, pages 90–91.(2) <em>qodeš</em> refers to God’s chosen people, the people of Israel. They are also called the “holy seed/race” in Ezra 9:2 and Isaiah 6:13. The people of Israel had profaned their nation by marrying foreign wives and by failing to keep their marriage vows to their wives. This fits the immediate context well, and has a similar meaning to the parallel passage in Ezra. Ezra chapters 9 and 10 and Nehemiah 13:23–29 make it clear that marriage with women who worshiped foreign gods was a serious problem in Israel at that time. Marriage with such women is strongly forbidden in a number of places in Scripture. See, for example, Exodus 34:15–16, Deuteronomy 7:3–4, also 2 Cor. 6:14–15. This interpretation is discussed by Baldwin (1972) pages 238–239, Dods (1990) page 143, Keil and Delitzsch (1950), page 449, and Lange (1960), page 16.(3) A third interpretation is that the “holiness” of Yahweh refers here to the covenant, picking up the reference to the covenant in the previous verse (Merrill 1994, page 418).(4) Yet another interpretation is that ‘the holiness of Yahweh’ might also refer to the essential holiness of Yahweh, his ‘apartness’ from anything we ourselves know by experience. In this case the profaning would consist of treating God as something common, considering his holiness to be unimportant. This is supported by Hill, pages 230–1.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD’s beloved:</strong> That is, which the LORD loves.</p><h4>2:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and have married women who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worship</span> foreign gods.</p></li><li><p>and have married women who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">worship</span> idols.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by marrying the daughter of a foreign god:</strong> Again scholars suggest different meanings for this part of the verse:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The debate on the meaning of ‘daughter of a foreign god’ has been extensive. The main question has been whether this phrase is figurative, and refers to the fact that the nation of Israel was itself involved in pagan worship, or whether it is literal, and refers to the fact that they are marrying pagan women, who worshipped idols. Glazier-McDonald (1987 <sup>(2)</sup>) argues that both meanings are meant by Malachi, and that one is incomplete without the other. See also the articles by Ogden (1988) and Clark (1998).</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “you have married women who worship other gods.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the men of Judah married women who worship foreign gods. (NCV) <em>(GNT, NCV, NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “you have turned to worship a foreign god.” This uses the metaphor of adultery to describe the way the people of Israel were being unfaithful to the LORD. This is a common metaphor in the OT. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For Judah has…turned to a foreign god! (NET) <em>(NET, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions are ambiguous here. However it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This fits well with the context in 2:10–11.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>daughter:</strong> This word is used in a collective sense here. The meaning is plural, that is, women.</p>",

It highlights its main theme: that is, that both the priests and the people had been unfaithful to the LORD. The LORD here called them to repent and to follow him again.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section lists three specific ways in which the people of Israel as a nation had broken their covenant with the LORD:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They had married wives who worshipped foreign gods.</p></li><li><p>They had been unfaithful to their wives.</p></li><li><p>They had even divorced their wives.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Also the people had been hypocritical. They asked the LORD to help them in order to show that they trusted him. Yet, at the same time, they continued to be unfaithful to him and to disobey him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Hebrew word <em>bagad</em> which means “faithless, treacherous” occurs five times in these verses. The repeated use of the word highlights both the unfaithfulness of the people to the LORD and their unfaithfulness to their wives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section contains one of the few places in the book in which it was the prophet himself who addressed the people. The prophet rebuked the people of Israel because they had been unfaithful to the LORD. He began his rebuke with a series of rhetorical questions. The first two questions in this section form a doublet, which makes an emphatic beginning, and all the questions indicate strong feeling.</p></div><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who is awake and aware—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May Yahweh separate/remove any person who does such things, whoever he may be, so that he is separated forever from <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the descendants of</span> Jacob,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse Malachi expressed a strong desire or prayer. He wanted the LORD to punish all Israelite men who married women who worshipped other gods.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who is awake and aware:</strong> Scholars disagree about the type of punishment that Malachi meant here. The Hebrew text of this verse is hard to understand. There are two main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Malachi meant that the LORD should remove all such men from the community of Israel. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the Lord cut him off from the tents of Jacob… (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, CEV, GW, KJV, NLT, NCV, NET, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Malachi meant that the LORD should not allow such men to have anyone to defend or support them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May Yahweh deprive such an offender of witness and advocate… (NJB) <em>(NJB, RSV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the man who does this:</strong> This refers to any Israelite man who married a woman who worshipped idols. It includes those who had already done it and those who would do it in the future.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>cut off:</strong> The expression which the BSB translates as <em>cut off</em> is an idiom in Hebrew. Here it means “remove,” that is, the LORD should remove them from the Israelite community. The Hebrew text does not state how he would remove them: whether he would banish them or kill them. You should also leave this ambiguous. Some ways to say this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord <u>remove</u> from the community of Israel those who did this. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May the Lord <u>banish</u> from the dwellings of Jacob any who do this. (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I pray that the Lord will <u>no longer let</u> those who are guilty <u>belong to his people</u>. (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>from the tents of Jacob:</strong> This is an idiom which refers to all the people of Israel. They were the people who had a covenant relationship with the LORD and who worshipped him. The reference to <em>tents</em> came from the time when the descendants of Jacob/Israel, the people of Israel, lived in tents and wandered in the desert.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>everyone who is awake and aware:</strong> The Hebrew phrase which the BSB translates as <em>everyone who is awake and aware</em> is difficult to understand. Scholars make two main suggestions<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Clark (1998) gives an excellent review of the alternative possible interpretations here. See also Alden (1985), page 718; Dods (1990), page 143; Merrill (1994), page 419; Redditt (1995), pages 171–172. Yet another alternative but less likely interpretation, is ‘May the LORD cut off from Israel anyone who defends the ones guilty of marrying foreign wives.’</span></span> about its meaning in this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The two Hebrew words which the BSB translates as <em>awake</em> and <em>aware</em> function together as a Hebrew idiom, which, means “everyone.” From this interpretation comes “whoever they may be.” So the meaning of 2:12a is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May the LORD drive away those who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">marry foreign wives</span>, <u>whoever they may be</u>, so that they may never again be part of Israel. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, GW, NCV, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The two words have separate meanings and represent two groups of people or two different actions. The English versions that follow this view interpret the individual words differently.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Baldwin (1972) page 239.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…witness and advocate. (NJB) <em>(RSV, NJB, KJV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><h4>2:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>even if he brings an offering to the LORD of Hosts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>even if he were to bring/offer any gift/sacrifice to Yahweh Sabaot.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">may</span> Yahweh Sabaot <span data-bnType=\"implied\">remove him</span> without considering any gift/sacrifice he might bring to him!</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>even if he brings an offering to the LORD of Hosts:</strong> Scholars differ about how this phrase relates to the previous one. There are at least three views:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This phrase makes it clear that there is no exception to the punishment in 2:12a. Even offering a sacrifice to the LORD would not enable them to escape this punishment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[May the LORD banish from the dwellings of Jacob any who do this…] even though they bring offerings to the Lord of Hosts. (REB) <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This phrase expresses part of the punishment that Malachi spoke about in 2:12a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and never again let them participate in the offerings our nation brings to the Lord Almighty. (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>This phrase goes with the preceding phrase “any to witness or answer.” It lists another group of people or another action. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[any to witness or answer,] or to bring an offering to the Lord of hosts! (RSV) <em>(RSV, KJV, NASB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In English this idea is often expressed by using connectors like “even though” or “and yet.” Express it in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD of Hosts:</strong> See the note on 1:4d and 1:6e. Translate this term in the same way here.</p>",

The meaning which scholars choose mainly depends on how they interpret the Hebrew word for <em>one</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word <em>one</em> refers to the bond between a husband and wife that is formed when they marry each other. The implied subject can be expressed as “God” or <em>the LORD</em>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Didn’t the Lord make you <u>one</u> with your wife? (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, GW, CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word <em>one</em> refers to God, so it is the subject of the verb <em>made</em>. English versions that follow this interpretation supply the word “God” or capitalize the word <em>one</em> to clarify that it refers to God. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has not the <u>one</u> God made… (RSV)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NET Bible offers an alternative interpretation: ‘No one does this who has even a small portion of the Spirit in him.’ It interprets the following statement to refer to the example of Abraham’s union with Hagar as a warning.</span></span> <em>(RSV, NJPS, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). It fits the context well and it is an acceptable way to interpret the Hebrew grammar here. Also many scholars support it. From this point onwards in the Notes, this interpretation is assumed.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:15a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">This is a rhetorical question with the implied answer, “Yes, of course he did.” If your language would not use a rhetorical question in this way, it may be best to use an emphatic statement. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God made husbands and wives to become one body and one spirit… (NCV)</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>having a portion of the Spirit?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Your<sup>(plur)</sup> body and spirit belong to him.</p></li><li><p>Your<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">united</span> body and spirit are for him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>having a portion of the Spirit?:</strong> Scholars do not agree about the meaning of the Hebrew text of this part of the verse either. They also connect 2:15a and 2:15b in different ways. There are many views, but the Notes will discuss only the most likely interpretations:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another view is that no one who has even a little of the Spirit of God would do such a thing. (NET, NASB)</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that the flesh and spirit of a human and wife belong to the LORD. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>[Didn’t the Lord make you one with your wife?] In body and spirit you are his. (NLT) <em>(NIV, NRSV, NLT, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that the LORD made a husband and his wife become one in both flesh and spirit. It does not explicitly state that flesh and spirit belong to him. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Didn’t God create you to become like one person with your wife? (CEV) <em>(GNT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that the LORD made the human spirit. There are different variations of this view. Some scholars believe that the text refers to both flesh and spirit. Others believe that it refers to the spirit of life. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Did he not create a single being, having flesh and the breath of life? (NJB) <em>(RSV, NJB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This view fits with the LORD’s aim (2:15c) that husband and wife should have godly offspring. So the Display will use the NLT as the Source Line for 2:15b.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:15a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In Hebrew there are no pronouns in this part of the verse. Malachi was expressing a general fact about marriage that applies to every husband and wife. The NLT uses the pronouns “you,” “your,” and “you” to indicate this general reference. In some languages it may be more natural to use different pronouns or nouns to express this fact. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Has not the Lord made <u>them</u> one? In flesh and spirit <u>they</u> are his. (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Didn’t the LORD make <u>husbands and wives</u> one? In body and spirit <u>they</u> are his.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And why one?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Why did he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unite</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and your</span><sup>(sing)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wife</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like this</span>?</p></li><li><p>What was his purpose/desire <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in making you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">one</span>?</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And why one?:</strong> Scholars disagree about what this verse part means also. It is likely that Malachi was introducing God’s purpose in uniting husbands and wives. English versions express this meaning in different ways: For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>What was his purpose in this? (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And what does he want? (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This verse part is another rhetorical question. Its purpose is to introduce a new point. If you would not use a rhetorical question in that way in your language, it may be best to use a statement.</p><h4>2:15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Because He seeks godly offspring.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this because he wants you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to have</span> children who will follow/obey/respect him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Because He seeks godly offspring:</strong> The text refers here to children that a faithful husband and “the wife of your youth” (2:14b, 15f) may have.

It highlights its main theme: that is, that both the priests and the people had been unfaithful to the LORD. The LORD here called them to repent and to follow him again.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section lists three specific ways in which the people of Israel as a nation had broken their covenant with the LORD:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>They had married wives who worshipped foreign gods.</p></li><li><p>They had been unfaithful to their wives.</p></li><li><p>They had even divorced their wives.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Also the people had been hypocritical. They asked the LORD to help them in order to show that they trusted him. Yet, at the same time, they continued to be unfaithful to him and to disobey him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The Hebrew word <em>bagad</em> which means “faithless, treacherous” occurs five times in these verses. The repeated use of the word highlights both the unfaithfulness of the people to the LORD and their unfaithfulness to their wives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This section contains one of the few places in the book in which it was the prophet himself who addressed the people. The prophet rebuked the people of Israel because they had been unfaithful to the LORD. He began his rebuke with a series of rhetorical questions. The first two questions in this section form a doublet, which makes an emphatic beginning, and all the questions indicate strong feeling.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1039002013\" data-endVerseId=\"1039002016\"><h3>Paragraph 2:13–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paragraph 2:10–12 shows that the people were unfaithful to the LORD and unfaithful to his covenant because they had married women who worshipped foreign gods (idols). Paragraph 2:13–16 tells another way that the people of Israel were unfaithful. They were also unfaithful to each other in marriage.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice the use of the “Statement, Question, Response” pattern, introducing a new discourse unit. See note 6 in “Literary structure and recurring features in Malachi” in the Introduction.</p></div><h4>2:16</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The prophet stopped speaking his own words in 2:15, and in 2:16 the LORD once again spoke directly to the people.</p><h4>2:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“For I hate divorce,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“I am displeased when a man divorces his wife,”</p></li><li><p>“I hate it when people divorce each other,”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Hebrew connector <em>ki</em> introduces the reason for the command in 2:15. However it can be difficult to translate here because it connects the LORD’s own words with what the prophet had been saying. The meaning is that the people should not be unfaithful to their wives <u>because</u> the LORD hates divorce. In some languages this connection may be implied without a connector. If that is true in your language, you can omit it, as many English versions do. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord God of Israel says, “I hate divorce.” (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I hate divorce:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>divorce</em> literally means “sending away.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars interpret the implied subject of “hate” to be indefinite. This gives the sense “If anyone hating (his wife) divorces (her), says Yahweh the God of Israel, he covers his garment with violence.” REB “If a man divorces or puts away his wife, says the Lord God of Israel, he overwhelms her with cruelty.” Pohlig (1998) gives arguments in support of this interpretation.</span></span> In some languages it may be more natural to use a verb phrase rather than a noun to express the action of divorce. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hate it when a man divorces his wife.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When a man and his wife divorce, I hate that.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an expression which is natural in your language.</p><h4>2:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>says the LORD, the God of Israel.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>says Yahweh, the God of Israel,</p></li><li><p>Yahweh, the God of Israel, says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>says the LORD, the God of Israel:</strong> There is a change of speaker in 2:16. In some languages it may be necessary to begin the verse with the speech clause to make this clear. See the example from the NCV in 2:16a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD, the God of Israel:</strong> Notice that the longer title for God is used here. This emphasizes the fact that the LORD had started speaking again. It also highlights the importance and authority of the statement.</p><h4>2:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I hate it</span> when anyone is violent/cruel <span data-bnType=\"implied\">towards his wife</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by divorcing her</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence:</strong> Scholars do not agree about the meaning of the Hebrew text here. English versions have translated it in different ways. There are many views, but the Notes will discuss only the three which seem most accepted:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to divorce as being cruel towards a person’s wife. A <em>garment</em> may be a symbol for the wife.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>“Garment” is an Arabic idiom for a man’s wife. So covering one’s garment may possibly be a figure of speech referring to marriage. However, there are no other apparent examples of the use of this idiom in Biblical Hebrew.</span></span> For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hate divorce…I hate it when one of you <u>does such a cruel thing to his wife</u>. (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, NLT, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to cruel actions which affect or indicate a person’s own character. These actions might not be limited to divorce. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hate divorce…<u>and the one who is guilty of violence</u>. (NET) <em>(NIV, NET, GW, NCV, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means to do violent or cruel actions and conceal them in some way. The garment would be a symbol for concealment. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>For I hate divorce…<u>and people concealing their cruelty under a cloak</u>. (NJB) <em>(NJB, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1). In many languages the figure of a <em>garment</em> may be confusing. If that is true in your language, it may be best to drop the figure and translate the meaning directly. See GNT example under option (1).</p><h4>2:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are the words of Yahweh Sabaot.</p></li><li><p>Yahweh Sabaot has spoken.</p></li><li><p>This is what Yahweh Sabaot says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the LORD of Hosts:</strong> See the note on 1:4d, 1:6e and 2:12b.</p><h4>2:16e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So guard yourselves in your spirit</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“Therefore watch yourselves<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>“Therefore, be careful how you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">behave</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So guard yourselves in your spirit:</strong> The Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as <em>So guard yourselves in your spirit</em> is identical to the one used in 2:15e.</p><h4>2:16f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:16f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and do not break faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and do not fail to keep <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">promise</span> to be faithful/loyal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wife</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and do not break faith:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>break faith</em> is the same one which was used in 2:15f. The meaning of these verse parts is also the same, though 2:16f does not explicitly mention “the wife of your youth.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comments on 2:16a–f</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Scholars do not agree about where the LORD’s direct words end. There are two main possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>The LORD’s words continue to the end of the verse. <em>(GNT, RSV, NET, NLT, NASB, GW)</em></p></li><li><p>The LORD’s words end at 2:16c and the words in 2:16e–f are the words of Malachi. <em>(BSB, NIV, NCV)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In some English versions the punctuation system leaves this ambiguous (NJB, REB, CEV, NJPS).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Although parts of this section are difficult to understand, the main message is clear. The message is that divorce is an act of unfaithfulness, another example of breaking a covenant.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">This statement in 2:16e–f summarizes the theme of the section, and of the whole book, again. It gives a warning to those who fail to keep a commitment. This summary marks the end of this section.</p></div>",

However you should not make this information explicit in your translation. See also Malachi 4:5, where the messenger is identified figuratively with Elijah the prophet.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who will prepare the way before Me:</strong> The purpose of the messenger’s coming was to get people ready for the arrival of the Lord.

It was sometimes necessary for messengers to go ahead of a king and prepare the road so that it would be possible for him to pass. In some languages this figure of speech may not be clear. If that is true in your language, it may be necessary to make the meaning more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to prepare <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> for my <span data-bnType=\"implied\">coming</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like men prepare</span> the road <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for a king</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before Me:</strong> That is, before the Lord.</p><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Then the Lord whom you seek</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> the Lord, the one you<sup>(plur)</sup> are looking/waiting for,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Then</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">your</span><sup>(plur)</sup> Lord, about whom you<sup>(plur)</sup> say, ‘Where is he?,’</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Lord whom you seek:</strong> This is a reference to the coming Messiah—Jesus Christ.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alden (1985), Merrill (1994), page 431.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> The Hebrew word here is <em>ʾadon</em>, not <em>yhwh</em>.

That is, it refers to the Messiah—Jesus Christ.</p></li><li><p>The <em>Messenger of the covenant</em> is the same person referred to as “my messenger” in 3:1a, and so refers to John the Baptist.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Merrill (1994), pages 431–433.</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The parallelism between 3:1b–c and 3:1d–e supports this interpretation. The phrase the <em>Messenger of the covenant</em> is a title or description of this person. See the general comment about poetic parallelisms below.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Also in support of this interpretation is the fact that elsewhere in Scripture, “the angel of the LORD” is the LORD himself in human form. The Hebrew word <em>malaḵ</em> may mean either “messenger” or “angel.” NJPS translates “the angel of the covenant” and a number of French translations also translate using the word for “angel.” In Exodus 3:2, the LORD speaks to Moses as the “angel of the LORD,” and affirms again that he has a special relationship with his people and that he will deliver them. Possibly Malachi may have in mind Exodus 3:2, and other references to the angel of the LORD, when he refers to the LORD as the messenger/angel of the covenant. Keil and Delitzsch (1950), page 458; Baldwin (1972), page 243.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Messenger of the covenant:</strong> This person would proclaim the message about the covenant.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Messenger:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>Messenger</em> is the same word which occurred in 3:1a. It can refer to angels as well as human messengers. If it is possible to keep this ambiguity between “human messenger” and “angel” in your translation, do so. If that is not possible, you may wish to include a footnote saying that the words for “messenger” and “angel” are the same word in the original Hebrew text.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you use a term for “messenger,” be careful not to use a word which would imply someone of low status, such as an errand boy or servant.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the covenant:</strong> Malachi was still referring primarily to the original covenant<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Which covenant is referred to here? Unfortunately the commentators say little about this—Redditt doesn’t discuss it at all. Merrill seems to accept, without actually saying so, that it is the new covenant in view (and therefore presumably would agree with the GNT). Glazier-McDonald (1987 <sup>(1)</sup>) again doesn’t actually discuss it, but her description of the messenger as the “covenant-enforcer” seems to align with Keil and Delitzsch (1950). They alone discuss the question and see it as God’s covenant with Israel at Sinai.</span></span> which the LORD made with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai.

It was the only covenant of which they were aware.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to combine 3:1b, 3:1c and 3:1d. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Suddenly the Lord, whom you longingly expect, will come to his temple. It is he who is the messenger of the covenant.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">The poetic parallelisms highlight this verse as an important climax in this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>the Lord</u> <u>whom you seek</u> will suddenly come to His temple—</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>the Messenger of the covenant</u>, <u>in whom you delight</u>—see, <u>He</u> is coming,</p></blockquote></div><h4>3:1e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>see, He is coming,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Listen/Be-aware<sup>(plur)</sup>, he is coming.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>see:</strong> See the note on 3:1a.</p><h4>3:1f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are the words of Yahweh Sabaot.</p></li><li><p>Yahweh Sabaot has spoken.</p></li><li><p>This is what Yahweh Sabaot says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts:</strong> The speech clause, <em>says the LORD of Hosts</em> (or “says the LORD”), occurs many times throughout the text.

Here it indicates a contrast between 3:1 and 3:2. The actual coming of the LORD would not be like the people expected or desired. Express the contrast in a natural way in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>His coming:</strong> The words <em>His</em> in 3:2a and “He” in 3:2b refer to the <u>Lord</u> (Jesus Christ—the Messiah) spoken of in 3:1b. See also the note in 3:1d.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Interpretation (1) is supported by Alden (1985), page 719, Clarke (1823), page 805, Lange (1876), pages 19–20, Redditt (1995), page 176, and by CEV, NASB and an NIV footnote. Interpretation (2) is supported by Merrill (1994) pages 431–433. Merrill, however, is inconsistent in that he capitalizes “He” in his translation, suggestion that the messenger is Jesus.</span></span></p><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And who can stand when He appears?</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Will anyone be able to stand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before him</span> when he reveals himself?</p></li><li><p>No one will be able to stand/defend-himself.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And who can stand:</strong> The Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as <em>can stand</em> means almost the same as the verb which the BSB translates as “endure” in 3:2a. The idea is that no one will succeed in defending himself before the LORD when he comes to judge. In some languages it may be helpful to make that idea explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who will be able to stand and face him when he appears? (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Who will be able to survive when he appears? (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>3:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For He will be like a refiner’s fire,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For he will be like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the very hot</span> fire that burns all the impurities in metal until it is pure.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a refiner’s fire:</strong> The word <em>refiner</em> refers to a person who purified metal by heating it until it was red hot.

In the first metaphor, the Lord will <u>purify</u> the people, just as a refiner’s fire refines/purifies metal and destroys the impurities in it. In the second metaphor, he will <u>cleanse</u> his people, just as the launderer’s strong soap cleans the dirt from dirty clothes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">GNT changes the order of 3:2c and 3:2d, possibly because 3:3 continues the illustration of refining metal.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>2d</sup>He will be like strong soap, <sup>2c</sup>like a fire that refines metal.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">You should use the order that is most natural in your language.</p></div>",

In 2:10–16 Malachi and the LORD listed ways that the priests and people had been unfaithful. In 2:17, the focus becomes the LORD’s response to this unfaithfulness. So it seems best to consider 2:17 as the beginning of a new section, rather than as the end of the preceding section.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice also that this verse contains Malachi’s typical structure for beginning a new section:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>a statement by the LORD,</p></li><li><p>a question challenging the LORD’s statement,</p></li><li><p>and then the development of the theme of the section.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">See note 6 in “Literary structure and recurring features in Malachi” in the Introduction.</p></div><h4>3:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>against sorcerers</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>against those who do witchcraft,</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and adulterers</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>against those who commit/do adultery,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to speak</span> against those who are unfaithful to their husbands or wives</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:5h</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5h\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and deny justice to the foreigner</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and who push aside strangers/foreigners who are living in their villages.</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:5</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that GNT begins this verse with the phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord Almighty says. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Hebrew text, these words are at the end of 3:5 (as in the BSB). GNT moved these words to the beginning of 3:5 to make it clear that it was the LORD who was speaking here, not Malachi. Consider whether it may be necessary to do the same in your language.</p><h4>3:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Then I will draw near to you for judgment.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “I will come to you<sup>(plur)</sup> in order to judge you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Yahweh says,</span> “I will come near to judge you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Then:</strong> The Hebrew conjunction <em>w-</em> is translated by the BSB as <em>Then</em>. Here it introduces a new paragraph. The events which the LORD described in this paragraph would happen before the events of the preceding paragraph or at the same time. You will need to translate the connection in an appropriate way to avoid confusion in your language. English versions translate it with expressions like “then,” “at that time” or “so.” Some versions omit it. Use what would be natural in your language in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I will draw near to you for judgment:</strong> That is, I will come to you, in order to judge you. This judgment would be an answer to the accusation of the people in 2:17, “Where is the God of justice?”</p><h4>3:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And I will be a swift witness</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I will be quick to speak</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And I will be a swift witness:</strong> Other ways to express this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will quickly condemn.

Rather, the scene is that of a disobedient servant hauled before the Great King (Mal. 1:14) and accused by the King himself of covenant breaking. The whole interior dynamic of the book of Malachi is one of a <em>rîḇ</em>, that is, a juridical proceeding against covenant breakers. The Great King (the Hittite emperors were called that) is both accuser and judge. Witnesses are only incidental to the proceeding (Pohlig, personal communication).</span></span></p><h4>3:5e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and perjurers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>against those who tell lies in the court,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to speak</span> against those who tell lies when they have sworn/promised to tell the truth,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>perjurers:</strong> The Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as <em>perjurers</em> means to swear that a false statement is really true.</p><h4>3:5f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>against oppressors of the widowed and fatherless,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to speak</span> against <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those who cheat/take-advantage-of</span> widows and orphans,</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:5g</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:5g\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and against those who defraud laborers of their wages</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>against any person who refuses to give those who work for him the money he owes them,</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to speak</span> against those who do not give their workers the money they deserve,</p></li></ul></div><h4>3:5f–g</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>defraud:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>defraud</em> in 3:5g applies to the widow and orphan in 3:5f also.

It is not simply another category of people whom the LORD will judge. In some languages it will be clearer if the verse is re-ordered. The NJPS re-orders this verse to show this clearly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>and I will act as a relentless accuser <sup>5i</sup>against those who have no fear of Me: <sup>5c</sup>Who practice sorcery, <sup>5d</sup>who commit adultery, <sup>5e</sup>who swear falsely, <sup>5g</sup>who cheat laborers of their hire, <sup>5f</sup>and who subvert [the cause of] the widow, orphan, <sup>5h</sup>and stranger, <sup>5j</sup>said the Lord of Hosts.

See Verhoef (1987).</span></span> for the following statement in 3:6b.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A third interpretation is suggested by Glazier-McDonald (1987 <sup>(1)</sup>), taking <em>kî</em> as causal, introducing the reason why Yahweh has not changed: ‘because I am Yahweh, I have not changed.’ The statement ‘because I am Yahweh I have not changed’ then serves as the basis for the Yahweh’s appeal to the people to repent and return to him (3:6–12).Carl Follingstad (personal communication) has this to say in support of the first interpretation given in the Notes: “In many cases, <em>kî</em> is used to metarepresent a correcting thought relative to some assumed incorrect one held by the hearer. This is called <em>assertive focus</em> in Functional Grammar. In the English example, ‘he went’ versus ‘he DID go,’ the ‘did’ [termed ‘do periphrasis’] with focus intonation in the second sentence marks assertive focus—it means that the proposition ‘he went’ is not only stated, but positively asserted relative to some hesitant or contrary presupposition, whether implied or explicitly stated previously by the speaker himself in the context…it is primarily the focus intonation on NOT that is the equivalent of <em>kî</em> in English.…<em>kî</em> in Mal 3:6 is probably metarepresenting (or asserting) a correcting proposition relative to one which the speaker assumes the hearer/reader has at that point. Yahweh (through the prophet representing Yahweh) assumes the hearer/reader has overlooked, is hesitant about, or disbelieves the proposition ‘I the Lord do not change (contrary to your presupposition that I may change, or lack of appreciation or belief that I still judge the unjust, etc).’”For further discussion on the function of <em>kî</em> in Hebrew discourse, see Follingstad (2001).</span></span> Some ways to express the connection in English are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>Since</u>, I, the Lord, do not go back on my promises, you, sons of Jacob, have not perished. (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am the Lord, and I do not change. <u>That is why</u> you descendants of Jacob are not already completely destroyed. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am the Lord, and I do not change. And so you, the descendants of Jacob, are not yet completely lost. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I, the LORD, do not change:</strong> The people of Israel had not kept the LORD’s covenant. And in 2:17–3:5, the LORD warned them that he would judge them. So a reader might expect that the LORD would abandon the people of Israel and destroy them completely. But what the LORD said here was contrary to that expectation. He was reminding the people that he never changes, and therefore, in spite of all their unfaithfulness, he would still keep his covenant with them. So this section, 3:6–18, called the people of Israel to repent and begin to follow him again.</p><h4>3:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That is why you<sup>(plur)</sup>, descendants of Jacob, have not been destroyed.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I</span> have not destroyed you<sup>(plur)</sup> descendants of Jacob, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">deserve</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you descendants of Jacob:</strong> This refers to the people of Israel. It may be helpful to your readers to use a footnote to explain that the expression <em>descendants of Jacob</em> here refers to the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jacob:</strong> The name <em>Jacob</em>, rather than “Israel,” is often used in passages which focus on the weakness of the people of Israel. The name <em>Jacob</em> reminds people of a human being with weaknesses and frailty. “Israel” was the name God gave Jacob when he gave him a special position as the ancestor of the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have not been destroyed:</strong> The Hebrew verb which the BSB translates as <em>have not been destroyed</em> has the basic meaning of “bring to an end.” Scholars understand it in different ways in this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “have not been destroyed” or “have not ceased to exist.” In this context it implies that God had not destroyed the people of Israel because he never changes. This implies that he will remain faithful to the covenant he made with them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So you, O descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed. (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, RSV, CEV, NLT, NCV, GW, KJV, NASB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “have not ceased to be sons (descendants) of Jacob.” This interpretation follows the LXX. It probably involves an implied reference to the meaning of the name “Jacob,” that is, “deceiver.” In this context it implies that they have not ceased to be deceivers like their ancestor Jacob. This meaning relates closely to the idea of the following verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and you have not ceased to be children of Jacob. (REB) <em>(NJB, REB, NJPS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow option (1).</p>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>You, like your ancestors before you</u>, have turned away from my laws. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>statutes:</strong> Hebrew has a number of different words which are used to refer to laws and commandments.

Like the verb in 3:7b, it is used as an idiom. It implies that the relationship between the people and the LORD has been damaged and needs to be repaired. To <em>Return</em> would mean they must do what was necessary to again have a loving relationship with the LORD (that is, to be reconciled).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">For the people and the LORD to be reconciled, the word <em>Return</em> has a slightly different meaning in the two contexts. Firstly, the people must repent of their sins and once more obey the LORD’s law. Then the LORD would forgive them and again bless them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be possible to use the same verb for the actions of both the people and the LORD.

The question implies horror that such a thing could happen and yet it was happening. If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, you could use a statement. Here is one example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is wrong for a human being to rob God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>NET has a note: “The LXX presupposes <em>ḇqʿ</em>, “deceive,” a metathesis of <em>ʿḇq</em>, “rob,” in all four uses of the verb here. The intent probably is to soften the impact of robbing God, but the language of the passage is intentionally bold and there is no reason to go against the reading of the MT.” Some Bible versions (NLT, GW, NJB) follow that reading. It also has the attraction that this form of the verb would, in Hebrew, be a pun with the name for Jacob. However the MT (Hebrew text) makes good sense too, and there do not seem to be sufficient grounds for not following the Hebrew text.</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a man:</strong> This refers to human beings, not males only.</p><h4>3:8e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In tithes and offerings.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cheat me by not bringing me</span> your<sup>(plur)</sup> tithes and offerings.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">steal from me</span> the tithes and offerings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ought to bring to my temple</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>tithes:</strong> This refers to the tenth part of all the crops which the people of Israel produced on their farms.

See Leviticus 27:30 and Numbers 18:21–29.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>offerings:</strong> In this context the Hebrew word <em>tǝruma</em> which the BSB translates as <em>offerings</em> refers to the cereal and/or animal offerings, which also provided food for the priests.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Redditt (1995), page 179.</span></span></p>",

It is the opposite of being blessed. See the note on 1:14a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages the word for “curse” might convey a wrong meaning if you used it here. If that is true in your language, it may be more accurate if you use the idea that the LORD would judge or punish them. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You are bound for <u>judgement</u>… (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be more natural to express this idea with an intransitive verb or with an active expression.

Rain is closely associated with blessing in the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 11:13–14).

In contrast to the people referred to in 3:14–15, this verse refers to people who feared the LORD.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who feared the LORD:</strong> This refers to the people who were faithful to the LORD and respected him.

The record probably mentioned their names and also may have included their words and deeds which showed their faithfulness to him. Someone wrote this record in the LORD’s presence. Malachi does not tell us who this person was.

The Hebrew word translated <em>prepare</em> is a general word. However, in this context it refers to the day when the LORD will act as judge to punish or reward people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My treasured possession:</strong> This expression reflects the words of the covenant which the LORD made with the people of Israel at Sinai. In that covenant he chose them to be his own people, to belong to him (Exodus 19:5). The expression used here (<em>My treasured possession</em>) implies that they were special to him and that he would especially value them.</p><p data-indent=\"3\">In some languages, it may not be natural to speak of people as a <em>possession</em> in this way.

That is, he would not punish them. Most English versions use the word <em>spare</em> (BSB, RSV, NIV, NET, NLT, REB, KJV, NASB NJB GW), but some versions use the idea of “mercy,” “compassion,” or “protection.” (GNT, CEV, NCV, NJPS) Here are examples of translation possibilities:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I will spare them, just as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him. (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As a parent shows mercy to his child who serves him, I will show mercy to my people. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who serves him:</strong> This refers to a person who loyally obeys the LORD and submits to his will. Use a natural expression in your language for obeying or submitting to someone in authority. This same expression is also used in 3:18b.</p>",

However this time the sequence is expanded. The “Statement-Question” part occurs twice before a longer “Response” is given. (Another difference is that the second statement begins with a short question.) The “Statement-Question-Response” pattern marks the beginning of a new section.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">3:6 is a transitional verse, as 2:17 was. Again, it is recommended that you take it as the first verse of this new section.</p></div><h4>3:18a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then you<sup>(plur)</sup> will again realise that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I do treat</span> the righteous <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> and the wicked <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> in different <span data-bnType=\"implied\">ways</span>,</p></li><li><p>At that time, you<sup>(plur)</sup> shall see/understand that those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who do/act right and those who do evil are different <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to me</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So:</strong> The word <em>So</em> in the BSB translates the Hebrew conjunction <em>w-</em>. In this context the text probably implies that 3:18 is the result of God’s actions in 3:17. When the LORD spares the people who serve him, people will again understand that there is a difference in the way he treats righteous people and wicked people. This will be an answer to their accusations in 3:14–15.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to use a time phrase like “When that happens.” Use what is natural in your language for this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked:</strong> That is, you will be able to understand the difference between righteous people and wicked people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the way I treat them</span>. GNT makes this explicit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>my people will see the difference between what happens to the righteous and to the wicked. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>again:</strong> The Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as <em>again</em> used in this context implies that in the past they had realized the difference between the way the LORD treated righteous people and the way he treated wicked people. Now they would understand that difference again.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the righteous:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>the righteous</em> means “(those who) conform to a standard.” In this context, it refers to people who behave according to the LORD’s standards and do what he considers to be right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the wicked:</strong> This refers to people who do evil. It is the opposite of “the righteous.”</p><h4>3:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>between those who serve God and those who do not.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will know that</span> those who serve/obey God are treated differently from those who do not.”</p></li><li><p>Those who serve/obey God/me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are the ones whom I will spare</span>, and those who do not obey me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are the ones whom I will judge/punish</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those who serve God:</strong> This verb also occurred in 3:17. Try to translate it in the same way here. See the note on 3:17d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God:</strong> In this verse God is still speaking. However he uses his title to speak about himself. In some languages it may be necessary to add a pronoun like “me” here to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…one who serves me, God.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:18a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The two parts of this verse (3:18a and 3:18b) mean almost the same thing. “those who serve God” (3:18b) is another way to refer to “the righteous&quot; person (3:18a). “those who do not&quot; serve God is another way to refer to “the wicked&quot; person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Alden (1985), page 723; Baldwin (1972), page 249.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to combine these expressions.

Some English translations follow that Hebrew verse numbering, but in this book, the notes follow the more common English convention. It is recommended that you follow the numbering system of the versions used most in your area.</p></div><h4>4:1</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Notice that 4:1 uses the same image of refining that was used in 3:1–3.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The LORD is still speaking in 4:1, but the Hebrew text does not make this explicit until 4:1d. In some languages it may be helpful to change this order and begin the verse with this speech clause. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The Lord Almighty says, “The day is coming…” (GNT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ “Listen<sup>(plur)</sup>. The day is coming <span data-bnType=\"implied\">soon</span>, a day that will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a</span> burning <span data-bnType=\"implied\">fire</span> in an oven.</p></li><li><p>¶ “Beware<sup>(plur)</sup>. The day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when I will judge people</span> is certainly coming. The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">punishment I pronounce on that</span> day will be like a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">huge</span> fire in a furnace.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>ki</em> which the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces a clause which further explains the time when the event in 3:18 would happen. The clause uses figures of speech to explain how people would know the difference between righteous people and wicked ones. Try to find a natural way to express this connection in your translation. In some languages the connection may be implied and may not require a connector in the text.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>behold:</strong> The Hebrew word <em>hinneh</em> which the BSB translates as <em>behold</em> was also used in 2:3a and 3:1a. In the same way as it was used in those verses, it is used here to draw attention to what follows. In this context it also announces something which was certain to happen soon because it was the LORD who would cause it to happen.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the day is coming:</strong> This refers to the day/time when the LORD will come to judge everyone. In other parts of the Bible, this time is called “the day of the LORD.” In this context it may refer to a time period longer than a 24-hour day.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse <em>day</em> is also used as a figure of speech. It refers to what will happen on that day, that is, the way the LORD will judge/punish people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>burning like a furnace:</strong> This verse uses a simile to compare the day when the LORD will judge people to a <em>furnace</em> or large oven where people/things could be burned up. On that day the LORD will punish people severely and destroy them like the fire in a furnace burns things and destroys them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may not be natural to compare a day with a furnace. It may be necessary to make the meaning explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when I judge people</span> will certainly come. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">The judgements of</span> that day will be like fire in an oven…</p></blockquote><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It will destroy</span> all the people who are proud, and all the people who do evil. They will be like dry grass/straw <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that immediately burns in a fire</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I will destroy</span> all the people who are proud and all the people who do evil.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble:</strong> There is a <u>metaphor</u> here. In 4:1a the day of judgement was compared to a furnace which would burn people/things up. In this part of the verse those who are proud and do evil are compared to stubble.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the arrogant:</strong> This is the same word which was used in 3:15a. You should translate it in a similar way here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>evildoer:</strong> The Hebrew word used here is very similar in meaning to the one which the BSB translates as “wicked” in 3:18a. It refers to people who do what is evil, that is, what the LORD considers to be wrong. If possible you should use the same term here as you did in 3:18.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stubble:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>stubble</em> refers to the straw which remains after the wheat grains have been removed during the harvest. It burns easily because it is very dry.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may not be clear how the arrogant and evil people are like stubble. The idea is probably that they will be destroyed very easily and quickly on the day of judgement. It may sometimes be necessary to make the meaning explicit in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All the people who are arrogant and who do evil will be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">destroyed as quickly</span> as stubble burns up.</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>On that day they will be burnt/destroyed completely,”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the day is coming when I will set them ablaze:</strong> This sentence continues to use the word <em>day</em> as a figure of speech. It represents the judgements which will happen on that day. In some languages this meaning must be made explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>On that day <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of judgement</span> that is coming I will destroy them completely.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>set them ablaze:</strong> The Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as <em>set them ablaze</em> is different from the word which the BSB translated as “burning” in 4:1a. The expression here can be used literally to describe burning something completely, until it is only ashes. Here it is probably used as a figure of speech. It means that the people would be completely destroyed when the LORD judged them.</p><h4>4:1d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Yahweh Sabaot declares,</p></li><li><p>Yahweh Sabaot says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts:</strong> The speech clause, <em>says the LORD of Hosts</em> (or “says the LORD”) occurs many times throughout the text. It emphasizes again and again that this is a direct message from the LORD. See the note on 1:2b, 1:6e, 3:5j and 3:7e. See note 1 in “Literary structure and recurring features in Malachi” in the Introduction.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that in the BSB this clause occurs after the speech. This is good English style. You should place it wherever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD of Hosts:</strong> This special title for the LORD occurs twenty-four times in Malachi. See the note on 3:1f. See also the discussion of this term in the Key biblical terms in the book of Malachi section in the Introduction.</p><h4>4:1e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Not a root or branch will be left to them.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“like a plant/tree/bush that burns so completely that not a single root or branch remains.”</p></li><li><p>“no single branch/twig, no root, will remain.”</p></li><li><p>“so that nothing at all remains of them.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Not a root or branch will be left to them:</strong> This expression again emphasizes complete destruction. It symbolizes this destruction by using a figure of speech. The evil-doers would be like a plant which the LORD would completely destroy, even with all of its roots and branches.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If a literal translation is not clear in your language, there are at least two other possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They will be consumed like a tree—roots and all. (NLT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning directly without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and there will be nothing left of them. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an option which is clear and natural in your language.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1a–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In this verse the LORD uses a word picture to express what the day of judgement will be like. The picture has at least three parts:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>That day (or the punishments on that day) will be like a great fire in a furnace.</p></li><li><p>Evil people will be destroyed like stubble is destroyed in a fire.</p></li><li><p>They will be like a plant/tree that is completely burned up with all its roots and branches.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be difficult to use all of these word pictures in this verse. If that is true in your language, you may need to omit some of the details of the word picture. For example, GNT does not mention the “furnace” or “branches and roots.”</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The day is coming when all proud and evil people will burn like straw. On that day they will burn up, and there will be nothing left of them.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Express the meaning in a vivid, clear and natural way in your language.</p></div>",

In some languages it may be helpful to make that contrast explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>But it will be different on that day</u> for you who revere my name.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you who fear My name:</strong> See “fear” in the note on 1:6c–d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My name:</strong> In the Hebrew Bible, the phrase “the LORD’s name” or “his name” refers to God himself or his authority. It was also used in this way in 1:6. See the note on 1:6f. GNT simply uses “me” instead of <em>My name</em>.</p><h4>4:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the sun of righteousness will rise</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the sun <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that brings</span> righteousness will rise</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the one who brings</span> righteousness will rise <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the sun</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the sun of righteousness will rise:</strong> This is a metaphor. Although commentators and English versions differ about the interpretation here, it probably refers to the coming of the Messiah (see 3:1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This metaphor of the sun rising indicates that, as the Messiah comes, he will bring light and will end darkness. In other words, he will bring goodness and justice and destroy evil.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Many early commentators interpreted the “sun of righteousness” to refer to Christ. Keil and Delitzsch (1950, page 468) suggest that, while it is true that it is the coming of Christ that reveals the righteousness of God, in this context it is “righteousness” (Hebrew <em>ṣǝdaq</em>) itself that is compared to the sun. These interpretations are similar, since the Lord is the one who brings righteousness. The Hebrew word has the basic idea of “conforming to a standard.” In the Bible this standard is the LORD’s and consists of what he knows is right and good. This standard is applicable both to righteous character and to justice in society.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> is the word <em>ṣedaqah</em>. It occurs frequently in the Old Testament. It is usually translated either <em>righteousness</em> or “justice.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context it refers to the <em>righteousness</em> that the Messiah will bring when he comes. When he comes, he intends to cause his people to be righteous and to restore justice.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate <em>ṣedaqah</em> here as “righteousness.”</p><h4>4:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with healing in its wings,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to heal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> with its rays.</p></li><li><p>to heal/restore <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and protect you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He will</span> heal <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and deliver you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with healing in its wings:</strong> Scholars do not agree about what this figure of speech means. The wings of the sun probably refer to the sun’s rays.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>At the time when Malachi lived, artists often drew the sun with outstretched wings.</span></span> This symbolizes power and protection.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">So, in this context, Malachi used this figure of speech to refer to the LORD’s power to heal and protect his people from harm.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>healing:</strong> The idea of <em>healing</em> here implies more than physical healing. It also implies spiritual healing that brings peace and well-being. In Jeremiah 33:6, the same word is used in a similar way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a word like “healing” may refer only to physical healing. If that is true in your language, you may want to use an expression which could include spiritual healing, as well.

See the note on 4:2a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will go out and leap like calves from the stall:</strong> This compares the people to calves which jump playfully when their owners release them from confinement. The emphasis is on the people’s joy and freedom. It is not on the place they will leave or go to.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The LORD was implying that on the day when he comes to bring justice/righteousness, he will free his people from all that oppresses them. Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and you will skip about like calves released from the stall. (NET)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the stall:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>the stall</em> literally means “tying place.” It refers to the place where calves were kept and fattened.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This Hebrew expression for “stall-fed calves” occurs only three other times in the Hebrew Bible: 1 Samuel 28:24, Jeremiah 46:21 and Amos 6:4.</span></span> This probably implies that the calves were well fed and healthy. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You will jump around, like well-fed calves. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However most English versions omit this implication. Instead they focus on the calves’ freedom from the stall or from the place where they have been tied.

Here it introduces another event which will happen for the LORD’s people on the day when he comes. Many English versions translate it as “and” or “then” or omit it. Others use a time phrase. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>On the day when I act</u>, you will overcome the wicked. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use the option that is most natural in your language for this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will trample the wicked:</strong> The Hebrew phrase which the BSB translates as <em>you will trample the wicked</em> literally means that the righteous people will walk on those who are wicked. They will press or crush them with their feet. This is a symbol which may refer to two different customs of that time:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>When people made wine, they walked on the grapes, crushing them with their feet in a “winepress.” In the Bible, this process is used as a symbol for God’s judgement. For example: “the winepress of the wrath of God” (Revelation 14:19).</p></li><li><p>When people conquered their enemies, they often made the enemies lie down so that they could put their feet on the enemies’ necks. That was a symbol of complete victory.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse the expression symbolizes that the LORD will give the righteous people complete victory over the wicked. There are several options for translation:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will trample those who are evil. (CEV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the symbol directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will overcome the wicked. (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will triumph over the wicked, as though you were walking on them.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Use an option which is appropriate for your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the wicked:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>wicked</em> is the plural form of the same word which was used in 3:18. See the notes on 3:18a and 4:1b. In these verses the LORD referred to the same group of people, that is, those who did evil.</p><h4>4:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because they will be like ashes/dust that you<sup>(plur)</sup> walk upon</p></li><li><p>like people walk on ashes/dust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and crush them</span> under their feet</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Hebrew connector <em>ki</em> which the BSB translates as <em>for</em> introduces a clause which adds details to explain 4:3a. Here are some ways that English versions have translated it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will tread upon the wicked <u>as if</u> they were dust under your feet… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Then you will crush the wicked <u>like</u> ashes under your feet… (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Use a natural connection in your language for this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will be ashes under the soles of your feet:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>ashes</em> can mean either “ashes” or “dust:”</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to ashes. It adds to the idea of 4:1, which states that evildoers will be completely burnt. Then the righteous will trample on their ashes. In that way they participate symbolically in their punishment. <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NJB, NASB, KJV, CEV, REB, NCV, GW, NET)</em></p></li><li><p>It refers to dust. It symbolizes the complete humiliation and defeat of the wicked. <em>(GNT, NLT, NJPS)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either option is acceptable, and you should use the one that communicates best in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Hebrew expression which the BSB translates as <em>they will be ashes under the soles of your feet</em> is a metaphor. Here are some translation possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate literally. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they will be ashes under the soles of your feet. (NIV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile without stating its meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet. (NET)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning of the symbol and then use a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You will triumph over them as completely as though they were ashes under your feet.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Be sure to use an option which will connect naturally with your translation of 4:3a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>under the soles of your feet:</strong> This reference to a specific part of the foot makes the word picture more vivid in Hebrew. In some languages it may be more natural to make the reference general. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>like ashes under your feet. (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>on the day I am preparing,”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>on the day when I will act <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to judge people</span>.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>on the day I am preparing:</strong> This is the same phrase as in 3:17c. Try to translate it in the same way here.</p><h4>4:3d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These are the words of Yahweh Sabaot.</p></li><li><p>Yahweh Sabaot has spoken.</p></li><li><p>This is what Yahweh Sabaot says <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>says the LORD of Hosts:</strong> See the note on 3:1f.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the LORD of Hosts:</strong> See the note on 3:1f.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:3a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to re-order some of the information in this verse. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3c</sup>When I come to bring justice, <sup>3a</sup>you will trample those who are evil, <sup>3b</sup>as though they were ashes under your feet. <sup>3d</sup>I, the Lord All-Powerful, have spoken!

This is made explicit in 4:4b. In some languages it may be more natural to make it explicit here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>My servant Moses:</strong> Moses is called the LORD’s <em>servant</em> because he consistently obeyed and submitted himself to the LORD. In some languages a word like “servant” may imply wrong meanings. If that is true in your language, try to express the idea of loyalty and obedience in a natural way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses, who faithfully obeyed me</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Moses, my faithful worker.</p></blockquote><h4>4:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the statutes and ordinances I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These laws included my rules and regulations.

He decided what was right to do in particular cases, and those decisions continued to apply for all future cases of that type. This has been translated in various ways by English versions. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>precepts (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>regulations (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>commands (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all Israel:</strong> This refers to all the people of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Horeb:</strong> This is an alternative name for Mount Sinai, where the LORD gave his law to Moses.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:4b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Although the terms “statutes” and “ordinances” are not always exact synonyms, here they do function as synonyms.

This is a different Hebrew word than the one that was used in 2:2 and 3:9. This word means that the person or thing which is cursed must be totally destroyed. In this verse, the LORD indicated that if people did not change as described in 4:6a–b, he would totally destroy the land of Israel.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages this meaning must be made explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>otherwise I would have to come and <u>destroy</u> your country. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>strike:</strong> The Hebrew word which the BSB translates as <em>strike</em> can be translated as “smite,” “destroy,” or “punish.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the land:</strong> This refers to the land of Israel.</p>",
