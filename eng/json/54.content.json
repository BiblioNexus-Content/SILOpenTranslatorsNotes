Then he wrote a short prayer for Timothy. Paul began this letter the way most people did when they wrote letters in New Testament times. That is why he put his name first and then wrote Timothy’s name.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In your language, people may not start letters the same way that Paul did. To follow the Greek word order might even convey wrong information. It may, therefore, be necessary to change the order of some of the information. Perhaps your readers may not understand that this was a letter or would think that Paul was being rude or was not well-educated. So in some languages it may be necessary to place the name of the person to whom Paul was writing before Paul’s own name. Then follow that with information that Paul was an apostle by the command of God.</p></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul:</strong> Paul began this letter to Timothy by stating his own name first. In some languages, it is not natural for a person to use his own name to refer to himself, as Paul did here. If that is the case in your language, you may have to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In addition, Paul did not use a verb here, so you may have to supply one. For example, you may have to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am sending this letter</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other possibilities are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I, Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">greet you</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>an apostle of Christ Jesus</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> an apostle of Christ Jesus,</p></li><li><p>Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sent me as his</span> representative.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an apostle of Christ Jesus:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostle</em> means “sent one.” Therefore an <em>apostle</em> is someone who has been sent to do a specific job. Christ Jesus had sent Paul to represent him and authorized Paul to teach others about him. For more information, see apostle in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul referred to <em>Jesus</em> as <em>Christ Jesus</em> instead of “Jesus Christ.” The names “Christ Jesus” and “Jesus Christ” refer to the same person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some people, however, think that when Paul used the word <em>Christ</em> before the word <em>Jesus</em>, as in <em>Christ Jesus</em>, he was emphasizing that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In most English versions “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated in the same order as they occur in the Greek manuscripts. It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that, in some languages, people may be confused to see the names in two different orders. They may even think that Paul was referring to two different people. If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Savior and Christ Jesus our<sup>(incl)</sup> hope commanded me to be.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">It was</span> God who saves us<sup>(incl)</sup> and Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in whom</span> we<sup>(incl)</sup> hope <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who</span> appointed me <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be an apostle</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope:</strong> Paul knew he was an apostle was because God and Christ wanted him to be one. He did not choose himself to be an apostle. The other apostles did not choose him either, nor did any other human being. Rather, Paul became an apostle by the <em>command</em> of God and of Christ Jesus. They had appointed him to be an apostle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>the command</em> with a verb. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope <u>commanded/commissioned</u> me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God our Savior:</strong> When Paul mentioned <em>God</em> here, he was referring to God the Father. New Testament authors usually refer to Christ as <em>Savior</em>. However, Paul used this expression six times in 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>our:</strong> This refers to Paul, Timothy, and the Ephesian believers.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Savior:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Savior</em> refers to a person who saves or rescues someone else from danger. Paul was saying that God rescues all people who trust in Christ. In other words, he saves them from their sin and its consequences.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus our hope:</strong> When Paul described Christ as <em>our hope</em>, he meant that Christ was the one who gives Christians hope.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to translate <em>hope</em> with a verb. One way to express this would be to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we can hope/trust in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>our:</strong> Here again this refers to Paul, Timothy, and the Ephesian believers.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:1c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul became an apostle because God and Christ had appointed him as one. This was Paul’s main point in 1:1. In 1:1c, he also included the information that God is our Savior and that Christ Jesus is our hope. This is secondary information. Paul did not explain how or why God is our Savior or in what way Christ Jesus is our hope. Do not add too many details to your translation to explain what it means to say that God is our Savior and that Christ is our hope. Otherwise your readers may miss Paul’s main point.</p></div>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing this letter to you,</span> Timothy.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I greet you,</span> Timothy.</p></blockquote><h4>1:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>my true child in the faith:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You are my very own son <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because you also</span> trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>You are just <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a son to me because you believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ as I do</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">If you have already translated Titus, compare 1 Timothy 1:2 to Titus 1:4. The Titus passage has a similar meaning. It differs in that it has “in our common faith” instead of “in the faith.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>my true child:</strong> This is a metaphor. Paul meant that Timothy was <u>like</u> a son to him; that is, he loved him like a father loves his son.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not possible to call someone “my son” if he is not a biological son. If that is true in your language, you may be able to use a simile rather than a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are like</span> a real son to me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you may prefer to use a more natural expression, such as “my dear [Timothy]” or “my beloved [Timothy].”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>true:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>true</em> can also be translated “genuine” or “real.” When Paul described Timothy as his <em>true son</em>, he probably meant that he loved Timothy as much as he would love his biological son.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the faith:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>in the faith</em> is literally “in faith.” Here it probably refers to Timothy’s own faith. For example, the NCV has:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>because you believe, [you are like a son to me]</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Timothy was like a son to Paul because Timothy believed in Christ (as Paul himself did). See also Titus 1:4a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, meaning 1 in the Glossary.</p><h4>1:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May God the Father and Christ Jesus our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord show <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you his</span> favor and mercy and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">give you</span> peace.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that</span> God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> Father, and Christ Jesus, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">who is</span> our<sup>(incl)</sup> master, would be kind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to you</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">treat you</span> mercifully, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">grant you</span> well-being.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord:</strong> When people wrote letters in Greek they often began them with a short prayer like this. Compare this to the similar greeting-prayers in Titus 1:4; Romans 1:7; and Philippians 1:2. This kind of prayer is called a “blessing.” Paul was asking God to bless Timothy.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I pray that…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I ask God and Christ Jesus our Lord to…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Compare this to the similar greeting-prayers in Titus 1:4; Romans 1:7; and Philippians 1:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Grace</em> means “favor, good will, kindness.” Paul wanted God to show kindness and favor to Timothy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to use an expression to translate the word <em>Grace</em>. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May [God the Father and Christ Jesus our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord] be kind to you<sup>(sing)</sup>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See Grace, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> also refers to God’s kindness and compassion toward people. But <em>mercy</em> emphasizes that God is kind and does not punish someone who deserves it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>peace</em> applies to three aspects:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the absence of conflict within oneself</p></li><li><p>the absence of conflict between oneself and another person</p></li><li><p>the absence of conflict between oneself and God</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">However, Paul was probably using the word <em>peace</em> here as people who spoke Hebrew used the word <em>shalom</em>. This Hebrew word refers to wholeness or well-being. It was used to talk about people who live in peace with God and with other people. If your language has a word that combines the ideas of inner peace and inner well-being, use it here. Otherwise, use a word that refers to an absence of conflict.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>God the Father:</strong> You may need to translate this phrase as “God our<sup>(incl)</sup> Father” if that is the natural way to say this phrase in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our:</strong> This again refers to Paul, Timothy, and the Ephesian believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> is a general word that means “master.” It was used to address any respected person. Here it refers to Christ. You could translate it as “owner” or “chief.”</p>",

In 1:3–4, Paul was reminding Timothy about this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Specifically, Paul told Timothy to command people to stop using the lists of ancestors in the Scriptures to teach things that were untrue.

In New Testament times, it was a province in the Roman Empire. Paul may have been writing this letter from one of the cities there, perhaps Philippi. You may need to supply the information that Macedonia was a region or province.</p><h4>1:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you should stay on at Ephesus</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>remain in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the city of</span> Ephesus</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you should stay on:</strong> In some languages it may be more natural to translate this as a direct quote. One possibility might be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Before I left for Macedonia, I told you: “Stay here in Ephesus…”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Ephesus:</strong> Ephesus was a large city in the Roman province of Asia. Paul first visited Ephesus on his second missionary journey (Acts 18:19–21). On his third missionary journey, he stayed and taught there for about two years (Acts 19:1–41).</p><h4>1:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to instruct certain men</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you may command those <span data-bnType=\"implied\">false teachers</span></p></li><li><p>and give this command to the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">false teachers</span> there:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to instruct:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to instruct</em> here indicates purpose.

The phrase would then mean that false teachers were teaching <em>myths</em> that they based on <em>endless genealogies</em>. For example, Lock, page 8, says that the two words should “be taken closely together, <em>muthoi</em> being defined by <em>genealogiai</em>, legendary stories about genealogies.” Stott, page 44, agrees.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>myths:</strong> A <em>myth</em> is a story that has been made up and passed down from one generation to another. It may be based on something that happened in the past. Or it might be something made up to teach people why they should follow certain customs. But it is not true like history. See also 2 Timothy 4:4 and Titus 1:14.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>endless genealogies:</strong> A “genealogy” is a list of the names of ancestors in a family history. It shows how people are related to each other. Paul did not explain what <em>genealogies</em> he meant here<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some commentators think that the false teachers in Crete studied the Jewish genealogies in the OT and tried to find secret meaning in them. Other commentators think that the false teachers studied long lists of names of angels and other supernatural beings that they thought could help them reach God.</span></span>, but it was probably something connected to religion, and something that people studied and argued about.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some people do not think that Paul was referring to lists of ancestors when he said <em>genealogies</em>. They say that he was talking about different spirits, or angels, that stood between men and God. The idea that there were different levels of spirits, or angels, between men and God is a part of Gnosticism. But Paul was probably not talking about this here. Stott, page 45, comments: “There are two main problems with this reconstruction [that Paul was talking about Gnosticism]. The first is that Paul was not predicting the future phenomenon of developed second-century Gnosticism, but was describing a reality with which Timothy had to deal in his own day, in which Gnosticism had only begun to develop. Secondly, there is no evidence that the Gnostics ever referred to the aeons as ‘genealogies’…. All we can say in conclusion is that Paul’s references suggest a false teaching which combined Jewish and Gnostic elements, either ‘a Gnosticizing Judaism’ or ‘Judaizing forms of Gnosticism.’”</span></span><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, pages 73–74, drawing on Spicq, mentions that this kind of teaching is found in rabbinic Haggadah, Philo’s writings, the pseudo-Philonic <em>The Biblical Antiquities of Philo </em>(shortly after AD 70), in <em>The Book of Jubilees</em> (135–195 BC), and in the Qumran writings (cf. 1QS 3:13–15). Stott, page 44, says, “The author of <em>The Biblical Antiquities</em> supplements the biblical narrative ‘by means of his fabulous genealogies’, which occupy chapters 1, 2, 4 and 8. Similarly <em>The Book of Jubilees</em> supplies us with the names of all the children of Adam and Eve, of Enoch’s family, of Noah’s predecessors and descendants, and of the seventy people who went down into Egypt. It may be, then, that it is to this kind of fanciful literature that Paul is referring when he writes of law, myths and genealogies.”</span></span> See also Titus 3:9.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>endless:</strong> The genealogies that the false teachers taught were very long and complicated. That is the reason that Paul called the genealogies <em>endless</em>. This is an example of hyperbole or exaggeration.</p><h4>1:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which promote speculation</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The teaching of</span> these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">stories and ancestral lists only</span> encourages people to argue</p></li><li><p>When they teach people such things, everyone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">begins to</span> argue about them</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which:</strong> The relative pronoun <em>which</em> refers <u>grammatically</u> to the “endless genealogies” (1:4a). However Paul probably intended to refer both to the myths and to the genealogies.

A similar word occurs in 6:4b; 2 Timothy 2:23; and Titus 3:9. Scholars understand the word here in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “controversies” or “arguments.” These teachers spent a lot of time talking about “myths and endless genealogies.” This caused other people to discuss them and argue about them. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Such things only cause arguments. <em>(CEV, NIV, GNT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “speculations” or “questions.” People were listening to what the false teachers were teaching. When they heard these things, they began to wonder about things that were unimportant. For example, GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>These myths and genealogies raise a lot of questions <em>(BSB, GW, RSV, NJB, NASB, REB, NET, NLT, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).

By teaching wrongly, the false teachers were not working for God in the way that he wanted them to work for him. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They don’t help anyone to do God’s work <em>(BSB, CEV, NIV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to God’s <u>plan</u> to save people and change them so that they will behave as God wants them to behave. For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and do not further God’s plan for us <em>(REB, GNT, NJB, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>training</u> or instruction. For example, the RSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>rather than the divine training</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). <em>God’s work</em> refers to work that is done for God or work that God has given people to do.</p><h4>1:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which is by faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for this work can only be done</span> by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">those</span> who believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></li><li><p>which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they can only do</span> by believing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by faith:</strong> There are two different ways to interpret the Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>by faith</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>A person can only do God’s work when <u>he himself</u> has faith in God. The NCV probably follows this interpretation when it says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s work…is done in faith. <em>(NCV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>A person can only do God’s work when he helps <u>other</u> <u>people</u> have <em>faith</em> in God.

But if you must be specific, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). God’s work can only be done by people who have faith. That is, only those who trust in him can do his work. See faith, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:3–4</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to combine these verses and change the order of some of the information. In 1:3b Paul told Timothy to stay in Ephesus. In 1:3c–d Paul told Timothy the purpose for that command. He wanted Timothy to tell certain men to stop teaching wrong things. In 1:4 he gave more details about this.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to mention some of the information about the false teachers before you translate Paul’s command. This will help people understand the reason that Paul wanted Timothy to tell them not to teach wrong doctrines. Here is one way to combine these verses and reorder the parts:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>4a</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">As you know, Timothy, there are some people in Ephesus who teach what is wrong.</span> They continually teach untrue stories which they base on long lists of ancestors. <sup>3a</sup>Remember when I was ready to go to Macedonia? <sup>3b</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">At that time</span> I asked you to remain in Ephesus <sup>3c</sup>and to tell those people <sup>3d</sup>not to teach like that. <sup>4b</sup>When they teach such things, people argue about them. <sup>4c</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The result is that those teachers are not doing</span> the work God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">gave them</span>, <sup>4d</sup><span data-bnType=\"implied\">which they can only do</span> by trusting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

The false teachers did not love other believers. They wanted people to think that they were important teachers but they did not teach the Scriptures correctly.</p></div><h4>1:5</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In Greek this verse connects with the previous verse with the Greek word <em>de</em>.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BAGD says that the word <em>de</em> is “one of the most commonly used Gk. particles, used to connect one clause w. another when it is felt that there is some contrast betw. them, though the contrast is oft. scarcely discernible. Most common translations: <em>but</em>, when a contrast is clearly implied; <em>and</em>, when a simple connective is desired, without contrast; freq. it cannot be translated at all.” However, Levinsohn (1992) refers to it simply as a “developmental marker, in the sense that the information it introduces builds on what has gone before and makes a distinct contribution to the argument” (page 64). He further adds, “…the sense in which material introduced with <em>de</em> builds on and develops from the context is not always readily apparent. However, we do well to take the presence of <em>de</em> seriously” (pages 65–66).</span></span> In this context, <em>de</em> shows that Paul was contrasting two ways of behaving: “arguing” (1:4b) and “loving each other” (1:5a). One way to translate this word in English is “instead.” People should not argue, but love one another.</p><h4>1:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>The goal of our instruction is the love</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Your</span> aim in <span data-bnType=\"implied\">giving</span> this command is that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people will show</span> love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to one another</span>,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">You should give</span> this command in order that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people will start to</span> love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each other</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>The goal of our instruction:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>goal</em> refers to the purpose/aim for which something is done. Timothy should give these instructions with a certain purpose in mind. In some languages it may be necessary to say “your” <em>goal</em>/purpose/aim instead of <u>the</u> <em>goal</em>/purpose/aim.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our instruction:</strong> There are at least three ways to interpret this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the instruction that <u>Timothy</u> was to give to the false teachers. In 1:3c–d Paul urged Timothy to instruct the false teachers to stop teaching incorrect doctrines. Here Paul told Timothy to instruct people to love each other instead of arguing about what the false teachers had said. For example, the NRSV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the aim of such instruction <em>(NRSV, NIV, GNT, NJB, CEV, REB, perhaps the BSB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>Paul’s</u> instruction to Timothy. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The purpose of my instruction… <em>(NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to <u>God’s</u> instruction to people to obey him and to teach others about him. It is another way of speaking of “God’s work,” which Paul mentioned in 1:4c. The RSV possibly follows this interpretation when it uses the expression “our charge.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, page 76, says, “Some would relate <em>παραγγελία</em> [=‘command’] to the specific charge of 1:3…. This is correct, but is also a too restricted view (so likewise in 1:18). The other occurrence of the word in Paul, in 1 Thes. 4:2 (plural), speaks of commands handed on from Christ as requirements for the Christian’s life. Since the context here speaks of Paul as an apostle according to commandment (1:1) and of Timothy being commanded by him in that capacity, <em>παραγγελία</em> [=‘command’] is used here in the broader sense of <em>the</em> command of the Christian life seen in its entirety as God’s charge to us (cf. Mt. 22:37–40; Mk. 12:31; 1 Jn. 4:21; 3:23). Not only does this understanding of the word fit with usage elsewhere in the NT, but more particularly it continues the emphasis on God’s <em>οἰκονομία</em> [=‘work’] (v. 4), which led to this statement in v. 5.”</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) which is supported by the majority of English versions.</p><h4>1:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that comes from a pure heart,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and this <span data-bnType=\"implied\">love</span> is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> produced from a heart that is without deceit,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In order to really love each other, we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">must</span> be sincere in what we<sup>(incl)</sup> do,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that comes from:</strong> Paul said that love <em>comes from</em> three sources: a pure heart (1:5b), a clear conscience and a sincere faith (1:5c). This means that if a person has these things, he will be able to love other people. One way to express this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If a man has a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith, he will [be able to] love others.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a pure heart:</strong> The phrase “to do something from <em>a pure heart</em>” means “to do something sincerely or without deceit.” In many languages there is an idiom to express this aspect of a person’s character. If your language has such an idiom, use it if it is appropriate.</p><h4>1:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>from a clean conscience and genuine trust.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">must do</span> what <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> know is right, and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">must</span> truly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">trust in Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a clear conscience:</strong> A person who has <em>a clear conscience</em> knows that he has done the right thing. Therefore he does not feel guilty. In English this is could also be expressed as “a good conscience.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>conscience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conscience</em> refers to the part of a person that helps him know what is right and what is wrong to think or do. A person’s conscience causes him to feel ashamed or guilty when he does something wrong. It also makes him feel good when he does what is right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in many languages, there is not a word that means <em>conscience</em>. In some languages, there may be an idiom that can be used. In other languages, it may be necessary to translate the expression <em>clear conscience</em> by an expression like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>doing what he knows is right</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a sincere faith:</strong> When a person has <em>a sincere faith</em>, it means that he truly trusts in God. In some languages it may be possible to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he truly/completely believes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p>",

The false teachers did not understand this, and so they were not teaching the law properly.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>People have interpreted the phrase “We also know that law is made not for the righteous” (1:9a) in several different ways. The interpretation which the Notes and the Display explain is probably the best interpretation. Other interpretations include the following:(1) Paul was not referring to the Mosaic law when he mentioned the word “law,” but to laws made by governments. When he said that “law is not for the righteous”, he meant that people would not need to make laws if everybody always did what was right. This fits the popular Greek thinking about the purpose of laws in general. This is a possible interpretation. It is true that people do not make laws for those who do what is right. The purpose of law is to change people’s behavior by warning them to avoid doing what is wrong or harmful. Paul referred to this to imply that the primary purpose of God’s laws in the Scriptures is similar to the purpose of other laws. This interpretation is very similar to what is detailed in the Notes. However, the immediate context in 1 Timothy talks about God’s laws <u>in the Scriptures</u>. It is unnecessary to think that Paul changed to talk about laws in general.(2) Paul did not mean that the righteous should not teach, study, and obey the law. Instead, he meant that they should not use it for teaching myths and speculation. Knight seems to follow this view when he says, “Paul is saying that the law is not given to apply in some mystical way to people who are already ‘righteous,’ i.e, those already seeking to conform to the law.” But the trouble with this interpretation is that it seems to mean the opposite of what the text actually says: that “the law <u>is</u> intended for the righteous,” while the text says “the law is not for the righteous.”(3) God’s commandments which are in the Old Testament are “not for the righteous” in the sense that Christians do not need to obey all the commandments and rules which are in the Old Testament in order to please God (as Galatians 5:18 says). Before Jesus came and fulfilled the law, God wanted people to obey him by carefully observing all the commandments in the Old Testament. But now, Christians serve God in a new way by obeying his Spirit (as Romans 7:6 says). However, this interpretation is not best because Paul did not talk about Christians no longer having to obey the Old Testament laws anywhere else in 1 Timothy. It would be surprising if he mentioned such a weighty topic in such a passing way in 1:9a.</span></span></p><h4>1:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>law is not enacted for the righteous,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> did not give his laws <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to correct</span> righteous people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> laws are not intended for people who do what is right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>law:</strong> Scholars interpret the word <em>law</em> here in two different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to the law that God gave to Moses, that is, the same law that Paul mentioned in 1:7a and 1:8a. English versions that say “<u>the</u> law” or “these laws” probably follow this interpretation. <em>(RSV, KJV, CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>It refers to all laws. This includes all human laws, as well as the law of Moses. English versions that say “law” or “laws” instead of “the law” probably follow this interpretation. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NASB, NET, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul had been talking about God’s law immediately before this verse, in 1:8. So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul’s point was that God gave people his law to stop them from doing wrong.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is not enacted:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>is not enacted</em> literally means “does not exist,” “does not exist for a purpose,” or “is not set.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida (13.73) say, “to exist, with the implication of having been established and thus having continuity and purpose - ‘to exist, to exist for, to be set.’”</span></span> In this context, you could also translate this word as “is not given.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the righteous:</strong> Paul used this phrase to mean that God gave his law because people were sinful (1:9b–1:10d) and needed to know the right way to behave.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When Paul said “<em>not enacted for the righteous</em>&quot;, he did not mean that righteous people should not learn about God’s law. But he meant that the law was not primarily intended to correct their behavior. It was intended to show other people that they were sinning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the righteous:</strong> A <em>righteous</em> person in this context refers to someone who is just and upright, who wants to do what pleases God.</p><h4>1:9c–f</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the rest of this verse, as well as in 1:10, Paul listed different kinds of people who needed to understand God’s law in order to stop sinning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The sins that Paul mentioned here are similar to the sins mentioned in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:2–17). Since the Ten Commandments refer to the most important of God’s laws, Paul possibly made his list of sins similar to the list in the Ten Commandments so that it would refer to those who break the most important of God’s laws. It is not always clear to which of the Ten Commandments each item on Paul’s list refers. Probably the first pair of words are general descriptions that introduce the whole list. After that, each element of the list is similar to one of the Ten Commandments.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\">The list is long, so in some languages it may be helpful to split the list into several shorter lists. If you do so, you may want to begin each list with something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God gave his law to teach people who…</p></blockquote><h4>1:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but for the lawless and rebellious,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God made his law</span> to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">correct</span> people who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">deliberately</span> disobey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span> and are rebellious,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek particle <em>de</em> that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> introduces a contrast between “the righteous” (1:9b) and “the lawless and rebellious” (1:9c).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the lawless:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the lawless</em> here refers to people who ignore God’s law and disobey it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and rebellious:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rebellious</em> refers to people who are disobedient to those in authority. They defy their authorities. Here Paul specifically refers to people who refuse to accept God’s authority. This word is also used in Titus 1:10.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These two words translated <em>lawless</em> and <em>rebellious</em> mean almost the same thing. In some languages it may be necessary to combine these two terms into one expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who disobey <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span></p></blockquote><h4>1:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the ungodly and sinful,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for people who behave as if God did not exist and for people who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continually</span> sin,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God gave his law for the sake of</span> people who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continually</span> ignore God and people who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">continually</span> sin,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the ungodly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>ungodly</em> refers to those who behave without respect for God. This word is also used in Romans 5:6 and Jude 4 and 15.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This may refer to the first of the Ten Commandments. Knight, page 84, points out, “<em>ἀσεβής</em> means ‘godless’ or ‘impious.’ Since the first commandment of the Decalogue (Ex. 20:3) prohibits having other gods and abandoning God as the one and only true God, and since the NT uses <em>σεβόμενοι</em> (<em>τὸν</em> <em>θεὸν</em>) of those who accepted the ethical monotheism of the OT (and of this commandment; cf. Acts 13:43, 50; 16:14; 17:4, 17; 18:7), then it is understandable how violators of this command could be designated by the <em>ἀ</em>-privative negative cognate of that concept, namely <em>ἀσεβής</em>.”</span></span> See godless, Word 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and sinful:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sinful</em> refers to a person who continues to sin without repenting.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Sometimes this word was used in a special way to refer to people who did not obey the Law of Moses, especially Gentiles (see for example Matthew 9:10–11, 11:19; Mark 2:15–16; Luke 5:30, 7:34, 15:1; Galatians 2:15). People called Gentiles “sinners” because they did not worship the Lord as the one true God. If that is what Paul meant, then the word <em>sinful</em> here refers especially to those who break the Second Commandment against worshiping idols (Exodus 20:4–6).</span></span></p><h4>1:9e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the unholy and profane,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who do wicked things and people who do not treat God with respect,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">for people</span> who are corrupt, people who do not honor God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the unholy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unholy</em> refers to people who behave in ways that do not please God. They behave wickedly and as if God were not important. Some English synonyms for this term are “irreverent,” “profane,” or “wicked.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This sin could be related to the Third Commandment, which says, “You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain…” (Exodus 20:7). Those who are <em>unholy</em> may either speak as if God were unimportant or behave as if he were unimportant.</span></span>. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unholy</em> occurs only here and in 2 Timothy 3:2.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and profane:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>profane</em> refers to people who do not respect God. They are only concerned about things in this world. See godless, Word 2, in the Glossary. This word is also used in Hebrews 12:16.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This word could be connected to the Fourth Commandment, which prohibits people from profaning the Sabbath by treating it as if it were like any other day (Exodus 20:8–11).</span></span></p><h4>1:9f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:9f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for killers of father or mother, for murderers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who kill their fathers or mothers, for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> who kill other people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">deliberately</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for killers of father or mother:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrase <em>those who kill their fathers or mothers</em> refers to those who radically disobey the Fifth Commandment, which says that a person must honor his or her father and mother (Exodus 20:12). At the time when Paul wrote, the words in Greek generally referred to those who actually killed their mother or father. Even so, it is worthwhile to note that in Exodus 21:15, which is found in a chapter which serves as a commentary on the Ten Commandments, God forbids even the striking of a person’s father or mother</span></span> The phrase <em>killers of father or mother</em> is literally “father-killers and mother-killers.” It refers to people who murder their fathers and to people who murder their mothers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for murderers:</strong> The term <em>murderers</em> refers to people who deliberately kill someone.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Sixth Commandment, in Exodus 20:13, prohibits murder.</span></span></p>",

That is, he told him to command certain people to stop teaching the Old Testament Scriptures incorrectly. Paul told Timothy that when people listened to the false teachers, they started arguing about things that were unimportant. Paul said that when Timothy taught the Scriptures, the result should be that people love one another, not that they argue with one another.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">After talking about the incorrect use of Scripture in 1:3–7, Paul talked about the correct use of Scripture in 1:8–11. Paul did not want people to use Scripture to speculate about unimportant things. Instead he wanted them to stop sinning and behave how God wanted them to behave.</p></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1055001008\" data-endVerseId=\"1055001011\"><h3>Paragraph 1:8–11</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul said that when people teach the Scriptures, they should teach them correctly.</p></div><h4>1:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This correct teaching</span> agrees with the good news about the glory of <span data-bnType=\"implied\">our</span><sup>(incl)</sup> wonderful God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>agrees with the glorious gospel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>agrees with</em> literally means “according to.” In this verse, Paul was saying that healthy instruction is instruction that agrees with the gospel. It is implied that, when people tell others about the gospel, they also teach about the way that God wants people to behave.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stott, page 50, makes an important point: “It is particularly noteworthy that sins which contravene the law (such as breaches of the Ten Commandments) are also contrary to the sound doctrine of the gospel. So the moral standards of the gospel do not differ from the moral standards of the law. We must not therefore imagine that, because we have embraced the gospel, we may now repudiate the law!…There is no antithesis between law and gospel in the moral standards which they teach; the antithesis is in the way of salvation, since the law condemns, while the gospel justifies.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the glorious gospel of the blessed God:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>the glorious gospel of the blessed God</em> is literally “the gospel of the glory of the blessed God….” Scholars do not agree about the way in which the Greek word for “glory” connects with the rest of the expression:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to God’s glory. For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the gospel which tells of the glory of the ever-blessed God <em>(REB, NJB, GW)</em> <em>Most commentators also follow this interpretation.</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to how glorious God is. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the [gospel]…from the glorious and blessed God <em>(GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the glory of the gospel itself. For example, the NIV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the glorious gospel of the blessed God <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NASB, NET, NLT, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Interpretation (1) has the strongest commentary support. It is recommended that you follow it. Paul was talking about the glory of God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Zerwick, §47, “where, as often happens in Paul, several genitives follow one another, each commonly depends upon the preceding one, e.g. 2 Cor 4:4…” See also BDF §168. Arichea and Hatton say that the reason is “because of the presence of the definite article before ‘glory’ in the Greek.” In 2 Corinthians 4:4, the construction is almost identical, mentioning “the gospel of the glory of Christ.” In 2 Corinthians 4:4 and 6 it is clear that the construction refers to the gospel which tells of the glory of Christ. The verses say, “The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.…For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out of darkness,’ made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.”</span></span> There is a similar phrase, “the gospel of the glory of Christ,” in 2 Corinthians 4:4.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>glorious:</strong> The Greek noun that the BSB translates as <em>glorious</em> literally means “glory” (see the REB). This refers to God’s greatness or majesty. See glory, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gospel:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gospel</em> literally means “good news.” In the New Testament it specifically refers to the good news about Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the blessed God:</strong> In the New Testament, the Greek word <em>makarios</em> that the BSB translates as <em>blessed</em> is only used to describe God here and in 6:15. It means that God has all blessings in himself. He is not dependent on anyone else for joy or for anything.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Hanson, page 60, says, “It came originally from pagan Greek literature (Homer calls the gods ‘blessed’), and was adopted by Hellenistic Judaism, which is no doubt how it entered the vocabulary of the author of the Pastorals. D-C [Dibelius and Conzelmann], rightly no doubt, see here traces of a liturgical style.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation, use an expression that would be appropriate for referring to God. Some possibilities are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who lives in perfect joy</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the God who has all blessings</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the perfect God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is not possible to use the definite article (<em>the</em>) in a phrase like <em>the blessed God.</em> To do so might cause the readers to think that there is another god who is not blessed. If this is true in your language, you may need to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>our<sup>(incl)</sup> blessed God</p></blockquote><h4>1:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with which I have been entrusted.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">the good news</span> that God has given me the responsibility <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to proclaim</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with which I have been entrusted:</strong> Paul was saying that God had trusted him to teach the gospel message accurately.</p>",

Some languages may not have a word that means <em>thank</em>. If your language is like that, you may have to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I tell Christ Jesus our Lord that he has done good to me.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Christ Jesus our Lord:</strong> This is the same expression that was used in 1:2c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul referred to <em>Jesus</em> as <em>Christ Jesus</em> instead of “Jesus Christ.” The names “Christ Jesus” and “Jesus Christ” refer to the same person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some people, however, think that when Paul used the word <em>Christ</em> before the word <em>Jesus</em>, as in <em>Christ Jesus</em>, he was emphasizing that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In most English versions “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated in the same order as they occur in the Greek manuscripts. It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that, in some languages, people may be confused to see the names in two different orders. They may even think that Paul was referring to two different people. If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our:</strong> This again refers to Paul, Timothy, and the Ephesian believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> is a general word that means “master.” It was used to address any respected person. It is a title used frequently in the New Testament to refer to either Christ or God. When it refers to them, you could translate it as “owner” or “chief.”</p><h4>1:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who has strengthened me,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">always</span> made me strong <span data-bnType=\"implied\">enough to serve him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>strengthened me:</strong> In 1:12c, Paul thanked Christ for giving him the responsibility to preach the gospel. But first he acknowledged that Christ had <em>strengthened</em> him to preach the gospel. That means that Christ enabled him to do it.</p><h4>1:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that He considered me faithful</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I thank him because</span> he treated me as someone whom he could trust</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that He considered me faithful:</strong> When Paul said that Christ had <em>considered</em> him <em>faithful</em>, he meant that Christ considered him to be trustworthy, dependable, and reliable.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Before Paul became a believer he had not been <em>faithful</em>. See 1:13. He had even persecuted those who believed in Christ, and he had blasphemed God. But, here in 1:12c, he said that, despite his past, Christ <u>treated</u> him as if he were <em>faithful</em>.</p><h4>1:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and appointed me to service.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and chose me to serve [him].</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and appointed me to service:</strong> The words <em>appointed me to service</em> explain the way in which Christ showed Paul that he considered him faithful. Paul used the word <em>service</em> here to refer to the task that Christ assigned to him. Paul’s task was to preach the gospel as an apostle. Christ appointed Paul to be his representative at the time when Paul first came to believe in him (see Acts 22:14–15).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>service:</strong> You may need to translate <em>service</em> with a verb like “serve.” In some languages it may also be necessary to supply an object that specifies whom Paul was to serve. If so, you should follow the model of the NIV, RSV, and GNT, and indicate that Christ had chosen Paul to serve him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word “serve” here refers to serving or working for God, doing what God asks a Christian to do. In some languages it might be better to use a word that means “worship.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:12a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">If you need to translate “thank” with direct speech, you may say something like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I say to Christ Jesus our Lord, he who has given me strength, “Thank you for considering me trustworthy and appointing me to serve you.”</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:12a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder this verse. For example, first mention that Christ gave Paul the responsibility to preach the gospel (1:12c–d). Then say that Christ had given him the strength to do it. One way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12a</sup>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord <sup>12c</sup>because he has counted me as faithful <sup>12d</sup>and called me to serve him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by preaching the gospel</span>. <sup>12b</sup>And he has made me strong <span data-bnType=\"implied\">enough to do what he called me to do</span>.</p></blockquote></div>",

See Acts 8:3 for details of how Paul (then called Saul) persecuted Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your language it may be necessary to say whom Paul persecuted. There are two possible objects for this verb:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul persecuted believers. Paul said in Acts 22:4 that he persecuted believers by searching for them and arresting them. Then, he took them to the people in authority who put them in prison or punished them in other ways. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I hunted down his people.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul persecuted Christ. For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I spoke against Christ and persecuted him. <em>(NCV, GNT, RSV, REB, CEV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and say that Paul persecuted believers.</p><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and a violent man;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and harm <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span></p></li><li><p>and act cruelly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">toward them</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a violent man:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>violent man</em> describes a person who behaves violently and speaks insolently and without respect. This word is also found in Romans 1:30 (third word in the list). Here in 1:13b, it implies that Paul acted cruelly and violently against the Christians whom he was persecuting.</p><h4>1:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>yet because I had acted in ignorance</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In spite of that, because I did not understand that I was doing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">evil</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>yet:</strong> This phrase shows the contrast between the sort of person Paul was and the way that God treated him. You should express this contrast in the way that is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> Paul was not implying that, because he had “acted in ignorance and unbelief,” his actions were not sinful. Instead, Paul was explaining the reason that Christ had shown him mercy, that is, because he “acted in ignorance and unbelief.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I had acted in ignorance:</strong> Paul had not been sinning against God deliberately. In some languages it may be necessary to specify what Paul was ignorant of. If this is true in your language, choose something very general. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I…did not know what I was doing</p></blockquote><h4>1:13e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and unbelief,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I did not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">yet</span> believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unbelief:</strong> When Paul said that he had acted in <em>unbelief</em>, he did not mean that before he became a Christian he did not believe in God. Rather, he was saying that he did not yet believe that Christ was the Savior whom God had sent. When he persecuted Christians, Paul actually believed that he was pleasing God.</p><h4>1:13f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I was shown mercy.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I received mercy.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> showed me mercy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was shown mercy:</strong> When Paul said that he <em>was shown mercy</em>, he meant that he was not judged or punished as he deserved.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not say who showed him mercy. However in some languages, it will be necessary to specify this. Scholars do not agree about whom Paul meant:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>He meant Christ. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But he [Christ Jesus] had mercy on me…</p></blockquote></li><li><p>He meant God. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>But God was merciful to me <em>(GNT, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Christ is called “our Lord” in 1:12a. Also the phrase <em>I was shown mercy</em> seems to mean almost the same thing as “the grace of our Lord was poured out on me” in 1:14a. For these reasons, if it is necessary for you to specify who had shown mercy to Paul, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and say that it was Jesus who showed him mercy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> also refers to God’s kindness and compassion toward people. But <em>mercy</em> emphasizes that God is kind and does not punish someone who deserves it.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><u>General Comment on 1:13d–f</u></p><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, the order is: (1:13f) Christ was merciful because (1:13d) Paul acted in ignorance and (1:13e) unbelief. In some languages it may be better to reorder these parts of the verse. Another way to do this would be:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13e</sup>I did not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">yet</span> believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> <sup>13d</sup>and so I did not understand <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that what I was doing was wrong</span>. <sup>13c</sup>Because of this Christ was merciful to me.</p></blockquote>",

See 1 Timothy 3:1, 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 1:9, 3:8. You should try to use the same expression of introduction in all these places. Paul used this expression to introduce a <em>saying</em> that was well-known among believers at that time. This <em>saying</em> is found in 1:15c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trustworthy:</strong> Paul said that this saying (1:15c) about Christ was <em>trustworthy</em>. That means that it was true and reliable. Other ways to say this could be: “This saying really is true,” or “people should believe this.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saying:</strong> A <em>saying</em> is an expression that is well known to people.

It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that, in some languages, people may be confused to see the names in two different orders. They may even think that Paul was referring to two different people. If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>to save sinners:</strong> This is the purpose for which Jesus came into the world. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>save</em> means “to rescue from danger.” In this context, the danger is that if a person does not repent and stop sinning, he will not receive eternal life.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>sinners:</strong> A <em>sinner</em> is a person who has disobeyed God.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:15c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Sayings are normally short because people want to remember them. Therefore translate this saying with as few words as possible. It would also be helpful to keep the saying in one sentence. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ Jesus came to earth to rescue people who have sinned.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to indicate the beginning and end of the saying in some way. For example, you may want to use quotation marks or a different printing style, such as italics. The JBP uses both.</p></div><h4>1:15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of whom I am the worst.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and I am the greatest <span data-bnType=\"implied\">sinner</span> of all.</p></li><li><p>Of all the people who have sinned, I am the one who has sinned the most.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of whom I am the worst:</strong> Notice that this part of the verse is not part of the saying in 1:15c. One way to make this clear would be to use special punctuation. For example, the NIV uses a dash, that is, —. If you place the saying in quotation marks, make sure you close the quotation marks at the end of 1:15c. Paul added these words to make it personal in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>I am the worst:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>worst</em> literally means “first.” Paul meant that he considered himself to be the greatest sinner. This did not mean that Paul had committed more or greater sins than anyone else in the world. It meant that Paul felt as if he were the worst sinner.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stott, page 53, says, “…when we are convicted of sin by the Holy Spirit, an immediate result is that we give up all such comparisons. Paul was so vividly aware of his own sins that he could not conceive that anybody could be worse. It is the language of every sinner whose conscience has been awakened and disturbed by the Holy Spirit. We may begin like the Pharisee in Jesus’ parable, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men’, but we end like the tax collector who beat his breast and said (literally), ‘God have mercy on me, <em>the</em> sinner [Luke 18:9ff.].’ The Pharisee indulged in odious comparisons; as far as the tax collector was concerned, however, there were no other sinners with whom to compare himself; he was the one and only.”</span></span> Paul was so aware of his own sins that he could not imagine that anybody could be worse than he was.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:15a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be best to reorder this verse. For example, it may be better to translate the saying before stating that it is trustworthy. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We believers</span> often say: <sup>15c</sup>“Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners.” <sup>15a</sup>These words are true <sup>15b</sup>and everyone can believe them without doubting them in any way. <sup>15d</sup>And I have sinned more than anyone…</p></blockquote></div>",

Paul was contrasting what he had done with the merciful way that Christ had treated him. He was the worst sinner, but Christ had mercy on him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for this very reason:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>for this very reason</em> literally means “because of this.” Scholars understand the word “this” in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word “this” refers to God’s purpose, as stated in 1:16b–d. For example,</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I was mercifully dealt with for this very purpose, that Jesus Christ… (REB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but God was merciful to me in order that Christ Jesus… (GNT) <em>(BSB, REB, GNT, NJB, NET, NLT, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word “this” refers back to the fact that Paul was the worst of sinners, as stated in 1:15c–d. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>since I was worse than anyone else, God had mercy on me… <em>(CEV, NIV, NRSV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Several English versions are ambiguous. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be difficult to use a phrase like “because of this” to refer to God’s purpose, which has not yet been stated. Consider how to introduce the purpose in a natural way in your language. It is also possible to leave the phrase “because of this” implicit, as the GNT, NCV, and GW have done.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was shown mercy:</strong> The Greek text does not state who was merciful to Paul. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Christ</p></li><li><p>God the Father (GNT, CEV, NLT)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most translations do not say who showed mercy to Paul. If possible you also should leave this ambiguous and say something like “I received mercy.” But in some languages it may be necessary to state who showed Paul mercy. In 1:16b, Paul said that it was Christ who showed patience toward him. Therefore, he was probably also referring to Christ here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mercy:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mercy</em> also refers to God’s kindness and compassion toward people. But <em>mercy</em> emphasizes that God is kind and does not punish someone who deserves it.</p><h4>1:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Christ Jesus <span data-bnType=\"implied\">wanted</span> to demonstrate how wonderfully patient he is by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">forgiving</span> me, who had sinned more than anyone else.</p></li><li><p>because I was the worst of sinners and he used me to show people that he had complete patience <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to wait</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">until I was ready to repent.</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> This is the Greek word <em>hina</em>. These words introduce a purpose clause. Paul had been shown mercy <u>in order that</u> he could be an example of the way that Christ forgives people. As stated above, the words “for that very reason” in 1:16a emphasize that purpose.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience:</strong> Paul expressed this as a purpose for which Christ Jesus had shown him mercy. That is, Christ wanted Paul to be an example to other people and show them that Christ forgives even the greatest sinner if he repents. For that reason Christ showed Paul mercy.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in me:</strong> When Paul said that Christ was going to display his patience <em>in me</em>, he meant “in my case,” or “in the way that he treated me.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the worst of sinners:</strong> See the note on “I am the worst” in 1:15d. Use the same expression here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>display:</strong> That is, “show” or “demonstrate.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His perfect patience:</strong> When Paul said that Christ showed <em>perfect patience</em> toward him, he probably meant that he had not punished Paul as soon as he sinned. Instead, he waited for him to repent (see 2 Peter 3:9).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>perfect:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>perfect</em> literally means “all.” In this context it can mean “perfect,” “utmost,” “full,” and “endless.” Paul used this word to show that he was amazed at how patient Christ was with him.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>patience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>patience</em> describes a person who is able to endure something unpleasant without complaining. Here Paul was referring to Christ’s patience with him even though he was “the worst of sinners.”</p><h4>1:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as an example to those who would believe in Him</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This was</span> in order to provide an example for people who would <span data-bnType=\"implied\">one day</span> believe in him.</p></li><li><p>Then people who would <span data-bnType=\"implied\">later</span> trust in him could realize that he would be patient with them in the same way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as an example:</strong> Christ wanted people to understand that he would be patient with them in the same way. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>example</em> also occurs in 2 Timothy 1:13, where the BSB translates it as “pattern.” For that reason Christ was patient with Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to those who would believe in Him:</strong> Paul was referring to those people who would believe in Christ in the future.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>believe in:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>believe</em> literally means “to have faith in.” It implies that the believer does not just know some facts about Christ. A person who believes <u>in</u> Christ believes that Christ is able and willing to do the things that he has promised to do.</p><h4>1:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for eternal life.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so these people will be able to</span> receive eternal life.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because they will trust in Christ,</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God will</span> give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">these people</span> life which continues forever.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for eternal life:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>for eternal life</em> has no verb. If you need a verb in your language, you could say, “to receive eternal life.” The meaning is that 1:16d is the result of 1:16c. People receive eternal life <u>because</u> they have believed in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is not possible to use a verb like “receive” with an object that cannot be touched, like “hope,” “joy,” “love,” or “eternal life.” In languages like that, it may be possible to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will give <span data-bnType=\"implied\">them</span> eternal life.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">cause them to</span> live forever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages it may be enough to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they will live forever</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal life:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>eternal life</em> means life that never ends. However, it does not refer to physical life. Rather, it refers to a quality of life that believers experience now, before they die,<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>For example, in John 3:36, Jesus says, “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life….” He uses the present tense “has,” not the future “will have.”</span></span> <u>and</u> that they will experience more fully after they die.</p>",

However if many people in your area use the KJV, it might be helpful to mention the alternative in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Other ways to translate the expression “the only God” are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he alone is God (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>there is no other God</p></blockquote><h4>1:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>be honor and glory forever and ever.

Amen.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>honor:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to use a verb rather than a noun like <em>honor</em>. To honor someone means to respect him and to treat him as an important person.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>glory:</strong> To give <em>glory</em> to someone means to worship him, to praise him, or to tell other people how wonderful he is. See glory, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to use direct speech in order to translate this. Here is one way to do that:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Let us</span> honor him, saying, “You are wonderful!”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>forever and ever:</strong> In Greek the expression that the BSB translates as <em>forever and ever</em> means that God deserves praise that <u>will never end</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Amen:</strong> When people in the Bible prayed to God, they often ended by saying <em>Amen</em>. This means not only that they had finished, but that they fully agreed with what they had said. Because this word is well known even today, many translations just transliterate it. Another possibility is to translate it with an expression like “so let it be.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:17a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">You may need to reorder this verse so that the description of God’s greatness comes after the call to praise.

When Paul called Timothy <em>my child</em>, he meant that Timothy was <u>like</u> a son to him and that he loved him like a father loves his son. See the comments on “my true son” in 1:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not possible to call someone “my child” if he is not a biological child. If that is true in your language, you may be able to use a simile rather than a metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You are like</span> my real son.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you may prefer to use a more natural expression, such as “my dear [Timothy]” or “my beloved [Timothy].”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I entrust you with this command:</strong> Paul was commanding Timothy to correct those who were teaching wrongly. The same Greek word which means “entrust” or “commit” is also used in 1 Timothy 6:20 and 2 Timothy 2:2.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>this command:</strong> Scholars interpret the phrase <em>this command</em> in several different ways.

You can read what Jesus told Paul in Acts 9:15–16, 22:14–15, 22:21 and 26:16–18. Jesus told Paul the following (see Hendriksen p. 85): (a) Paul would have a special job of announcing God’s message, (b) some of the details of his job, (c) Paul would suffer, and (d) Jesus would always help him when he suffered. It could be that the prophetic messages which Timothy received were similar to these messages which Paul received, although the details were probably different. If these messages were similar, then Timothy needed to remember things like the following: (a) It was God himself who had called him to the job of proclaiming the gospel. Timothy did not get this job merely from some person’s idea or from his own imagination. (b) God himself promised to help him do that job. Consequently, as Timothy remembered the prophecies which people had spoken about him, he would want to continue to do his job in spite of difficulties.</span></span> Paul was saying that what he was telling Timothy to do in this letter agreed with some prophecies that had been made about Timothy earlier. If Timothy did what Paul told him to, he would be doing what God, by means of the prophecies, had told him to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the previous prophecies about you:</strong> Paul was probably referring to the time (see 4:14b) when church leaders placed their hands on Timothy, prayed for him, and dedicated him as a pastor and special helper for Paul.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the previous prophecies:</strong> The word <em>prophecies</em> refers to special messages that the Holy Spirit gives to people.</p><h4>1:18c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that by them</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am telling you this</span> so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what those prophets told you</span> will encourage you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> Paul here told Timothy his purpose in reminding him about the prophecies.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by them:</strong> The pronoun <em>them</em> refers to the prophecies made about Timothy.

For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that with such encouragement… <em>(NET, RSV, REB, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Timothy was to <u>use</u> what the prophets said (as a weapon against evil). For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Use those words as weapons… <em>(BSB, GNT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Timothy was to <u>obey</u> what the prophets said.

Paul was probably telling Timothy to <u>remember</u> certain things. As Timothy remembered these things, he would be more likely to be faithful and “fight the good fight.”</p><h4>1:18d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you may fight the good fight,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to fight the good fight <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for the gospel</span>.</p></li><li><p>to fight well <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the same way that a good soldier fights hard in a battle</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fight the good fight:</strong> Timothy’s task was to proclaim the gospel and to correct false teaching. Paul wanted Timothy to continue to do this no matter how difficult it might become. He compared this to fighting. There are two ways to make this clearer. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to fight well in the Lord’s battles (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you will fight like a good soldier (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the phrase <em>fight the good fight</em> can only refer to physical fighting. If your language is like that, you may need to make it clear in you translation the way Timothy’s job was like fighting in a physical battle. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">contend for the truth of the gospel as a</span> good <span data-bnType=\"implied\">soldier</span> fights to win a war</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or you may have to translate without a comparison here, in order for Paul’s main point to be clear enough that people can understand it. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>continue to proclaim the gospel despite opposition</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>good fight:</strong> This has been interpreted in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means to fight well; that is, bravely or expertly. For example, the GNT says “fight well.” <em>(GNT, NJB, NLT, CEV)</em></p></li><li><p>It means that the fight was itself good; that is, just and right. When Timothy did his job to proclaim God’s message, he was fighting for a worthy principle or goal. GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>fight this noble war</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions are ambiguous. If you must choose between these interpretations, it is recommended that you choose interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>fight:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fight</em> means “campaign” or “war,” not a single battle.</p>",

He was to use his faith in God and his good conscience.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, people cannot use a verb like <em>hold on</em> with an object that cannot be touched, like <em>faith</em> or <em>a good conscience</em>. In such languages it may be necessary to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>continue to have faith and a good conscience</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>a good conscience:</strong> A person who has <em>a good conscience</em> does not feel guilty because he knows that he has done the right thing. In English this is often expressed as “a clear conscience.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>conscience:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>conscience</em> refers to the part of a person that helps him know what is right and what is wrong to think or do. A conscience causes a person to feel ashamed or guilty if he does wrong. It also makes him feel good when he does what is right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, in many languages, there is not a word that means <em>conscience</em>. In some languages, there may be an idiom that can be used. In other languages, it may be necessary to translate the expression <em>good conscience</em> by an expression like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>doing what he knows is right</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See the note on <em>good conscience</em> in 1:5c.</p><h4>1:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which some have rejected</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Some people no <span data-bnType=\"implied\">longer</span> pay attention to what they know is right.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">Here, Paul contrasted what he was telling Timothy to do with what some people had actually done. Paul implied that Timothy should not be like the other people whom he was describing here. In some languages it may be necessary to use a connecting word to express this contrast.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which some have rejected:</strong> the Greek word <em>ēn</em>, <em>which</em>, is singular. This means that it probably refers to only a “good conscience.” The RSV has made this clear by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>By rejecting conscience</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>some:</strong> Paul was probably referring to the people whom he had mentioned in 1:3c, people who were teaching wrong doctrines. What he said about them here is similar to what he said about them in 1:6a. That is, he had said that they had “strayed” from a “clear conscience” and a “sincere faith.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>have rejected:</strong> When Paul said that some people <em>rejected</em> a “good conscience,” he meant that they were no longer paying attention to what their conscience was telling them. So they were no longer doing what they knew was right.</p><h4>1:19c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:19c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and thereby shipwrecked their faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Such people</span> destroy their ability to believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the same way that a shipwreck destroys a ship</span>.</p></li><li><p>As a result, they no longer believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>shipwrecked their faith:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>shipwrecked their faith</em> is a metaphor. When a ship is <em>shipwrecked</em>, it gets damaged so badly that people can no longer use it. The ship is destroyed and useless. In this part of the verse, Paul used the word <em>shipwrecked</em> to refer to a person’s faith that would be destroyed. He was not referring to a literal ship. It is a person’s faith that is ruined. See faith, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If, in your area, ships and shipwrecks are unknown, it may not be possible to use a metaphor here. So you could do two things:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Explain the metaphor in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>they destroy their ability to trust God, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the same way that a shipwreck destroys a ship</span></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Remove the metaphor and translate the meaning directly.

They were encouraging their followers to consider themselves as better than other people and as part of a small, elite group that excluded other people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Fee, pages 61 and 62, says, “…what might be the place of this first paragraph in the argument? The frequent answer is that the point lies in verse 2, that prayer be made for rulers so that the church may enjoy a peaceful existence. It has even been suggested that a correct Christian attitude toward the state is what is in view. Verses 4–7, then, are seen as nearly irrelevant to that point, but go back to elaborate on a secondary point made in verse 1 (prayer be made for <em>everyone</em>). However, it seems much more likely that precisely the opposite is the case. The one clear concern that runs through the whole paragraph has to do with the gospel as for <em>everyone</em> (‘all people,’ vv. 1, 4–6, and 7). In this view, the phrase <em>this is good</em> in verse 3 refers to prayer <em>for everyone</em> in verse 1, thus seeing verse 2 as something of a digression —albeit as before (1:12–17), a meaningful one. The best explanation for this emphasis lies with the false teachers, who either through the esoteric, highly speculative nature of their teaching (1:4–6) or through its ‘Jewishness’ (1:7) or ascetic character (4:3) are promoting an elitist or exclusivist mentality among their followers. The whole paragraph attacks that narrowness.”</span></span></p></div><h4>2:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>First of all, then, I urge</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Timothy,</span>, the most important thing that I am strongly encouraging <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you and the other believers to do</span> is</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>First of all:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>First of all</em> is the word that means “first.” In this context there are two possible meanings:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to something that is <u>first in importance</u>. So Paul was saying that prayer was more important than anything else he mentioned in this section.</p></li><li><p>It refers to something that is <u>first in order</u>. So the first thing that Paul urged people to do in this section was to pray.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and translate <em>First of all</em> as “most importantly.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> is <em>oun</em>, which literally means “therefore.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida (89.50) say that it is a “marker of result, often implying the conclusion of a process of reasoning - ‘so, therefore, consequently, accordingly, then, so then.’”</span></span> It connects this paragraph to what Paul said in chapter 1. Try to translate this connection in a general way. For example, use a word like “therefore” or “so,” or an expression like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so, this is what I want you to do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>urge:</strong> In the Greek text, this word is the same as the word that the BSB translates as <em>urged</em> in 1:3a. Paul was strongly encouraging something or making an important request.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to say whom Paul was addressing or urging. If this is true in your language, you could use a second person plural pronoun (like “you<sup>(plur)</sup>”). This will make it clear that Paul was not only writing to Timothy, but expected other believers to read the letter.</p><h4>2:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to make requests <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> for all people, to pray and intercede for them, and to thank <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God for what he has done</span> for them.</p></li><li><p>to pray earnestly to God for everyone and also to thank God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for all that he does</span> for them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving:</strong> Paul used four Greek words to describe prayer. The BSB translates them as <em>petitions</em>, <em>prayers</em>, <em>intercessions</em>, and <em>thanksgiving</em>. The first three words all refer to asking God to do something. The last word, <em>thanksgiving</em>, refers to thanking God for what he has done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>petitions, prayers, intercessions:</strong> These three words mean almost the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>petitions:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>petitions</em> refers to people asking God for particular things that they or other people need.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>prayers:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prayers</em> is a more general word. It refers to people asking God in a general way to bless and care for themselves and other people.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>intercessions:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>intercessions</em> refers to people asking God to supply other people’s needs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The reason that Paul used these three similar words was to emphasize that prayer is important and that believers should pray often. However, in some languages there may not be three different words for prayer. If this is true in your language, translate this part of the verse in a way that emphasizes how important prayer is. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pray earnestly</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pray in every way</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>thanksgiving:</strong> Although the first three words that Paul used (<em>petitions</em>, <em>prayers</em>, <em>intercessions</em>) have a similar meaning, the final word in the list, <em>thanksgiving</em>, is different. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>thanksgiving</em> refers to people thanking God for what he has done rather than asking him to do something.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be offered for everyone:</strong> Paul meant that we should pray for all kinds of people, no matter who they are. No one should be excluded.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, page 115, says, “The repetition of <em>ὑπέρ</em> [=‘for’] and further specification, as a subgroup, of civil rulers (v. 2) points in the direction of it meaning all <em>kinds</em> of people. This meaning would fit in the other occurrences of the phrase in 1 Timothy and Titus (especially Tit. 3:2) and would appear to be the understanding of the term when it was first presented to Paul as the perspective for his ministry (Acts 22:15). It is also the most natural understanding in a number of the Pauline passages where an absolute universalism is a virtual impossibility and a reference to all <em>kinds</em> of individuals is more likely (cf. Rom. 12:17, 18; 2 Cor. 3:2; Phil. 4:5; perhaps 1 Thes. 2:15; cf. also <em>εἰς</em> <em>πάντας</em> in Rom. 10:12…).”</span></span></p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to start a new sentence for the idea of thanksgiving. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So first of all, I urge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> to make petitions, prayers and intercessions for all people. And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I urge you all</span> to thank <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God for all that he does for us</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In other languages, it may be necessary to reorder the verse and place 2:1a after 2:1b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I urge <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span><sup>(plur)</sup> to make petitions, prayers and intercessions for all people. And <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I urge you all</span> to thank <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>. These are the most important things to do.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:1b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be necessary to state what believers should ask God for. Paul wanted believers to pray that God would help people to stop sinning and begin to trust Christ. In the following verses (2:3–7) Paul said that God wanted to save all people. If you can avoid specifying what the believers should pray about, you should do so. However if you need to say what the believers should pray for, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to pray that everyone <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be saved</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In other languages, it may be necessary to state what people should thank God for. Avoid being too specific. Instead, use a general phrase like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>thank God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for everything he has done</span> for people</p></blockquote></div>",

Here in 2:2 Paul became more specific and said that believers should especially pray for people in positions of authority. Paul probably wanted the believers to ask God to help government officials to govern justly. When the authorities govern well, it is much more likely that people can live “peaceful and quiet lives,” as Paul mentioned in 2:2b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>kings:</strong> Notice that Paul used the plural form of the word for “king.” So he was not referring only to the Roman emperor (who ruled over all the countries in the Roman empire), but also to other rulers under the Emperor’s authority. For example, people called Agrippa a king, even though he was under the authority of the Roman emperor (Acts 25:13).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all those in authority:</strong> Paul wanted believers to pray not only for kings, but also for everyone who had authority in the community. This refers to government rulers and includes people like district officials and village chiefs—anyone who has been appointed or elected as a leader of the community.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:2a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul uses the expression “kings and all those in authority” to include everyone who was involved in governing people in any way or who was responsible for making sure people acted peacefully. It is important that you also communicate that all rulers are included from the most important ones to the lower officials.</p></div><h4>2:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">In that way</span>, we<sup>(incl)</sup> will be able to live peacefully and safely.</p></li><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they will enable</span> us<sup>(incl)</sup> to live in peace and security.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> The Greek word <em>hina</em> that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> shows the result of 2:2a, that is, the result when people in authority govern justly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>tranquil and quiet:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>tranquil and quiet</em> are very similar in meaning. They both refer to a way of life that is calm and orderly. In this context, Paul meant that if believers prayed for those in authority, then no one would cause trouble for the believers. They would be free to tell other people about Christ, to meet with other believers, and to worship God.</p><h4>2:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in all godliness and dignity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Then we<sup>(incl)</sup> will be able to freely worship God and to do what he wants us<sup>(incl)</sup> to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">When government officials govern justly, it is much easier for believers to obey God’s laws. They are able to meet together to worship God. They can tell also others freely about Christ because they do not fear that they will be persecuted or imprisoned.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>godliness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godliness</em> refers to the way people behave when they respect God. See godliness, godly in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>dignity:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates here as <em>dignity</em> could also be translated as “proper conduct,” “respect for God,” and “honesty.” This word also occurs in 3:4b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It could be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to act in the right way</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to act as one ought</p></blockquote>",

It is not clear where the saying ends.</p><h4>2:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For there is one God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For there is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">only</span> one God</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believe that</span> there is one <span data-bnType=\"implied\">true</span> God</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> Paul used the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> to introduce verses 2:5–6. Paul could have used this Greek word <em>gar</em> in one of two ways in this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>To loosely connect two thoughts<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>BAGD says that <em>for</em> (<em>γάρ</em>) in this verse expresses “continuation or connection (in later Gk. writers, where more recent users of the texts, not finding the causal force they expect, would often prefer to see it replaced by <em>δέ</em>…) <em>yes, indeed; certainly</em>…” See also Zerwick, paragraph 473. Dibelius and Conzelmann on page 41 say, “These verses are not easy to connect with what precedes. The contrast is not “<em>one</em> God and not <em>many</em>” (as in 1 Cor 8:6), but rather, looking back to “all men” (<em>πάντες</em>), “since there is <em>one</em> God, <em>all</em> shall be saved” (related to this are Rom 3:30 and Eph 4:6). However this connection seems secondary and the phrase is perhaps best explained by the assumption that the author concludes the thought with a solemn formula.”</span></span></p></li><li><p>To introduce a reason for the previous verses. This is the more normal use of <em>gar</em> in Greek.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">However, 2:5 says that there is one God (2:5a) and one mediator (2:5b). It does not give the reason why God wants to save everybody. Therefore, it is best to translate the word <em>For</em> here in a way that shows that 2:5 is loosely connected with what Paul had said in 2:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there is one God:</strong> One of the most important beliefs of the Bible is that <em>there is</em> <u>only</u> <em>one God</em>. Even before New Testament times Jewish people repeated the words of Deuteronomy 6:4 every day to remind themselves of this truth. These words say, “Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This confession is called the Shema. M. R. Wilson in <em>International Standard Bible Encyclopedia</em> (volume 4, page 469) says, “The practice of reciting the Shema daily is firmly established in the Mishnah (<em>ca</em>. A.D. 200), which underscores the Shema’s importance in Jewish religious experience by its opening words: ‘From what time in the evening may the <em>Shema’</em> be recited?’ (<em>Berakoth</em> i.1). But there is also evidence of the Shema’s use during and even before the NT era…”</span></span></p><h4>2:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and there is one mediator between God and men,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there is only</span> one person who can make peace between God and people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>one mediator between God and men:</strong> At the time when Paul wrote this letter, some Jewish people thought that Moses was the mediator between God and humanity. Other people thought that angels were mediators. Paul was making it clear here that there is only <em>one</em> person who can mediate between God and people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>mediator:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mediator</em> refers to a person who helps two people or groups of people resolve a dispute.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In 2:6a Paul explained the way in which Christ was the mediator between God and people. After Jesus died on the cross, he began to mediate between God and sinful people, so that God could accept them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>men</em> here does not only refer to males. It includes all human beings: men, women, and children.</p><h4>2:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the man Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>That person <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> Christ Jesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the man Christ Jesus:</strong> Jesus was both God and human. That means that he is a good mediator because he can represent both God and people. When Paul said here that Christ, the mediator, was a <em>man</em>, he was emphasizing that Christ was not only God, but also fully human.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>man</em> does not emphasize that Christ was male instead of female. Instead, it emphasizes that he is a person, a human being.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Notice that Paul said the name of the mediator, <em>Christ Jesus</em>, only after he had talked about him. By waiting until after he had talked about him to say his name, Paul emphasized the identity of the mediator. In your language it may be necessary to show this emphasis in another way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul referred to <em>Jesus</em> as <em>Christ Jesus</em> instead of “Jesus Christ.” The names “Christ Jesus” and “Jesus Christ” refer to the same person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some people, however, think that when Paul used the word <em>Christ</em> before the word <em>Jesus</em>, as in <em>Christ Jesus</em>, he was emphasizing that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In most English versions “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated in the same order as they occur in the Greek manuscripts. It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that, in some languages, people may be confused to see the names in two different orders. They may even think that Paul was referring to two different people. If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used in two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p>",

In this verse Paul said that Jesus himself was the ransom. When he died, he paid the price to set people free (see Romans 3:23–24 and 1 Peter 1:18–19).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul did not say who received the payment of Jesus’ death.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Since the New Testament never actually states to whom the payment was made, different theories have developed. The theory that God paid himself is referred to by Millard Erickson in <em>Christian Theology</em>, page 796, as the commercial or satisfaction theory of the atonement. He says, “It emphasizes that Christ died to satisfy a principle in the very nature of God the Father. Not only was the atonement not primarily directed at man, but it also did not involve any sort of payment to Satan.”</span></span> So you should avoid making this explicit in your translation.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>R. W. Lyon, in the article entitled “Ransom” in <em>Evangelical Dictionary of Theology</em>, page 908, says, “In the NT the terms of ransom and purchase, which in other contexts suggest an economic or financial exchange, speak of the consequences or results (cf. 1 Cor. 7:23). The release is from judgment (Rom. 3:25–26), sin (Eph. 1:7), death (Rom. 8:2). There is no need, then, to ask the question posed so often in the past: to whom was the ransom paid?”</span></span> For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He gave himself as a payment to free all people.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">and the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it will not be possible to keep the figure of speech about paying a ransom. If this is true in your language, you could follow the REB which says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>who sacrificed himself to win freedom for all mankind</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">However if you translate that way, the verse will not explain the way that Jesus’ death sets people free from sin. So try to keep the figure of speech if you can.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A similar Greek word <em>lutron</em> occurs in Matthew 20:28 and Mark 10:45. In those verses, Jesus said that he came “to give his life as a ransom for many.” Try to translate <em>ransom</em> in the same way here as you did in these other passages.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for:</strong> The Greek word <em>huper</em> that the BSB translates as <em>for</em> means “on behalf of, in the place of” in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>all</em> here refers to all people. It includes all human beings: men, women, and children.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is debate as to whether Christ actually died for all people, meaning every single person (this is called universal atonement), or only for the elect (this is called limited atonement). John Stott’s statement at this point is worth mentioning: “As with the statement that God desires all people to be saved, so with the statement that Christ gave himself for all people, it is possible to argue that ‘all’ means ‘all kinds and classes’ and not ‘absolutely everybody’. Yet it is probably wiser to concede that Scripture appears to affirm both positions in an antinomy [a logical contradiction which cannot be resolved] which we are at present unable to resolve. Whatever we may decide about the scope of the atonement, we are absolutely forbidden to limit the scope of world mission. The gospel must be preached to all, and salvation must be offered to all” (page 71).</span></span></p><h4>2:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the testimony that was given at just the right time.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>At the right time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he became</span> evidence <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that God wanted to save everyone</span>.</p></li><li><p>At the time <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> chose, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> provided <span data-bnType=\"implied\">him</span> as proof that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he wanted to save everyone</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the testimony that was given at just the right time:</strong> The Greek text here literally says “the testimony in its own times.” In most languages it is necessary to supply a verb here. The BSB does so by using the verb <em>given</em>. Paul had mentioned Christ’s sacrifice in 2:5b–6a. Here he said it was the message that <u>has been told</u> to people (by God).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the testimony:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>testimony</em> refers to something that proves something else. In this verse Paul said that Jesus’ death was a <em>testimony</em>, or proof, that God wanted all people to be saved (2:4a) and to come to know the truth (2:4b). The GNT makes this clear by translating this verse part as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That was the proof at the right time that God wants everyone to be saved</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>at just the right time:</strong> The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>at just the right time</em> means that God announced his message to people at the exact time he had chosen. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is the message that God gave to the world at the proper time.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">(BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT, NJB, NASB, REB, NET, CEV, NCV, NLT)</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:5–6</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">As stated above, these verses possibly contain a saying that believers used to recite. Some English versions try to show this by using a poetry format. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5a</sup>There is only one God,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5b</sup>and Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>is the only one</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>who can bring us</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>5c</sup>Jesus was truly human,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>and he gave himself</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to rescue all of us.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6b</sup>God showed us this</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>at the right time.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Another way to indicate this is to use quotations marks for the saying. However, scholars do not agree about where the saying ends. It may end with 2:6b, or 2:6b may have been a comment made by Paul. If it was a comment, it was not part of the saying (See the NRSV). Therefore, it is recommended that you do not use any special formatting here.</p></div>",

For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and that is why <em>(GNT, NCV, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Verse 7 is the <u>purpose</u> for which 2:6 occurred.

If you cannot keep the ambiguity, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Because God sent Christ Jesus to save all people (2:3–6), he appointed Paul to announce the gospel.</p><h4>2:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I was chosen to be a herald <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the gospel</span> and an apostle.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> appointed me to announce <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the gospel</span> and be an apostle.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I was appointed:</strong> The Greek text uses a passive here and does not say who had <em>appointed</em> Paul. If it is necessary in your language to use an active verb here, you should say that God appointed him. Some other words for <em>appointed</em> are “assigned” or “chosen.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a preacher:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>a preacher</em> is more literally “a herald.” A herald is a person that a king or another ruler has appointed to announce a message publicly. Paul was emphasizing that he announced important news like a herald does.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an apostle:</strong> Paul was emphasizing that God had sent him to represent Christ. For more details, see the note on “apostle” at 1:1b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be helpful to translate this part of the verse as a direct quote.

For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the message of faith and truth <em>(GNT, NIV, REB, GW, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>how</u> Paul taught, that is, he taught faithfully and truthfully.

There is no reason to think that Paul suddenly changed his topic and said that he himself was teaching faithfully and truthfully. So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). That is, Paul was continuing to talk about the message that he proclaimed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek words meaning “faith and truth” that the BSB translates as <em>faithful and true</em> can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This is a hendiadys; that is, the two words “faith” and “truth” refer to one thing.

For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the message of faith and truth <em>(BSB, GNT, GW, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and translate this as one phrase, “the true faith.” “The true faith” refers to God’s message.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>teacher of the Gentiles:</strong> <em>Gentiles</em> are people who are not Jews.

The Editorial Committee of the United Bible Societies New Testament (4<sup>th</sup> edition) gives the reading without “in Christ” an {A} rating, indicating that the text is almost certain.</span></span> I am not lying:</strong> Paul had written in 2:7b, that he had been appointed as an apostle. Then he added that he was <em>telling the truth</em> and <em>not lying</em>. This could refer to three things:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the whole sentence (GNT, NLT, GW)</p></li><li><p>just the phrase that he was a teacher of the Gentiles (NJB)</p></li><li><p>just the phrase that he was an apostle</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Other English versions are ambiguous. It is recommended that you translate this to refer to the whole sentence. Probably some people were saying that Paul was not really an apostle. Others may have been saying that Christ had not really authorized Paul to teach the Gentiles.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:7b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was not saying that God had chosen him to do three different jobs (herald, apostle, and teacher). Instead, he was saying that he had one task that had three parts. These same three parts are also mentioned in 2 Timothy 1:11.</p><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:7a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Another way to translate this verse is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>7a</sup>That is why <sup>7b</sup>God sent me as an apostle to announce <sup>7c</sup>and teach his true message even to those who are not Jews. <sup>7d</sup>What I am saying is true.

Here in 2:8, he told him <u>how</u> the men should pray. They should pray, “lifting holy hands,” and “without anger or disputing.”</p></div><h4>2:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore I want the men everywhere</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ I am telling men that wherever <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they meet to worship God,</span></p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Therefore</span>, in every place <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where believers gather to worship God,</span> I command the men</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> This translates the Greek word <em>oun</em>. This Greek word connects this verse with 2:1–7. Some translations leave the connection implicit here. You should use the method in your language that most clearly conveys that 2:8 is the result of previous verses, that is, God wants Christians to pray for everyone. <u>Therefore</u>, men should pray, lifting holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I want:</strong> Because Paul was an apostle (as he mentioned in 2:7b), he had authority to tell believers what he wanted them to do. He could also expect them to obey him. Therefore, when Paul wrote <em>I want</em>, he meant “I command.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the men:</strong> The Greek word here that the BSB translates as <em>men</em> means males as opposed to females. It seems that Paul was speaking here about a problem that specifically affected the male believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>everywhere:</strong> At the time when Paul was writing this letter, believers often met in each others’ houses to pray and worship God. The words that the BSB translates as <em>everywhere</em> probably refer to all the different places where believers met.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Ferguson (1991).</span></span> For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>wherever you assemble</p></blockquote><h4>2:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to pray, lifting up holy hands,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they should make sure that</span> they are living in a holy way <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before</span> they lift their hands to pray <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>.</p></li><li><p>to pray, raising their hands in total dedication <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to pray, lifting up holy hands:</strong> At the time when Paul was writing, people normally prayed standing up. They also often lifted their hands while they prayed.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Stott, page 82, refers the reader to the following references about standing for prayer: Nehemiah 9:5; cf. Genesis 18:22; 1 Samuel 1:26; Mark 11:25; Luke 18:11, 18:13; Revelation 7:9. He refers to the following references about “lifting” or “spreading” hands in prayer: Psalm 28:2; Lamentations 3:41; cf. Exodus 9:29, 17:11–12; 1 Kings 8:22; Nehemiah 8:6; Psalms 63:4, 134:2, 143:6.</span></span> This was also a common way to pray in the Old Testament. See Psalm 134:2, Lamentations 2:19 for examples.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy hands:</strong> Before men pray they should be sure to give themselves totally to God. Paul was emphasizing this when he said that men’s <em>hands</em> should be <em>holy</em>.</p><h4>2:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>without anger or dissension.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They should</span> not be angry or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">still have</span> an unresolved argument <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with someone</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They should</span> stop being angry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with anyone</span> and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">if they have been arguing with someone,</span> they should resolve the argument <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before they pray</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without anger or dissension:</strong> Here Paul mentioned specifically in what sense the men should be holy when they prayed. They should not feel angry toward anyone and they should not be continually quarreling with anyone. Jesus said something similar in Matthew 5:23–24.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>anger:</strong> Paul was saying that a person should not pray while he is angry with someone else. He was probably thinking mainly that believers should not be angry at each other. He meant that people should stop being angry so that they can pray.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dissension:</strong> Paul meant that people should resolve their arguments and quarrels before they pray.</p>",

Paul had instructed the men in Ephesus about a problem that was typical for them (2:8). In this paragraph he instructed the women in Ephesus about a problem that was typical for the women.</p></div><h4>2:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when believers meet to worship,</span> women are to dress appropriately.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Concerning</span> women, I want them to dress in a way that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people consider to be</span> proper.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Likewise, I want:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Likewise</em> literally means “in the same way.” In 2:8, Paul told men what he wanted them to do. Here, he began to tell women what he wanted them to do. It may be helpful in some languages to supply “I want” (from 2:8a) as the BSB has done.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the women:</strong> This probably refers to any female who is considered old enough to be married, even if she is still unmarried. Your language may have a general word that refers to both married and unmarried adult women. If so, you should use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to adorn themselves with respectable apparel:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>to adorn themselves with respectable apparel</em> is literally “to adorn themselves with modest clothing.” It is important to dress and behave <em>modestly</em>. Paul was telling the woman that they should not dress or behave in a way that made everyone look at them. Some of them probably spent too much money on clothes. Others maybe dressed in ways that people thought inappropriate.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>respectable apparel:</strong> The Greek word <em>kosmios</em> that the BSB translates as <em>respectable apparel</em> refers to dressing in a way that people in the community think of as proper, acceptable, or appropriate.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Louw and Nida on <em>kosmios</em>; 88.48 and 66.10.</span></span></p><h4>2:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with modesty, and with self-control,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They should be careful to dress</span> respectably and properly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with modesty, and with self-control:</strong> This part of the verse further describes the way in which women should dress.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>modesty:</strong> The Greek word<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Liddell and Scott say this word (<em>aidōs</em>) is used “as a moral feeling, <em>reverence, awe, respect </em>for the feeling or opinion of others or for one’s own conscience, and so <em>shame, self-respect…sense of honour</em>.” Louw and Nida (88.49) define it as “the quality of modesty, with the implication of resulting respect—‘modesty.’”</span></span> <em>aidōs</em> that the BSB translates as <em>modesty</em> means that a woman should dress in a way that did not offend other people. The way she dresses should also not bring shame and dishonor upon her. If she did not dress with modesty, people might think that she was dressing to attract men. Every culture has different standards of modesty. So try to avoid using a word or expression that describes specifically what is considered “modest” in your culture.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>self-control:</strong> The Greek word<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, page 134, says, “This word was used of one of the four cardinal virtues in Platonic philosophy (Plato, <em>Republic </em>4.430e) and signified a command over bodily passions, a state of self-mastery in the area of the appetite.”</span></span> <em>sōfrosunē</em> that the BSB translates as <em>self-control</em> means almost the same thing as <em>aidōs</em> <em>modesty</em>. It means to act in a way that people consider correct, acceptable, or appropriate.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These two words translated <em>modesty</em> and <em>self-control</em> mean almost the same thing. In some languages there will not be two separate words for this idea. If this is true in your language, you may translate it with one emphasized word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with the utmost decency</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:9b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be necessary to explain in more detail what Paul meant here. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>They should always be sure that their clothing covers their body sufficiently, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">rather than dressing in order to cause men to desire them</span>.</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:9c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:9c–d, Paul gave instructions about things Christian women should avoid when they made themselves beautiful. He chose as examples some ways in which immoral women (such as prostitutes) in Ephesus dressed. He could also have been referring to the way wealthy women dressed.</p><h4>2:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not with braided hair</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They should not</span> braid their hair,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They should not</span> arrange their hair in fancy ways,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">2:9c begins with the implied command “Do not adorn yourselves [with…].” You may need to supply a suitable verb here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>braided hair:</strong> When women <em>braid</em> their hair, they twist several strands of it together in a special way. They may have one, two, or many braids. In many parts of the world, this is a normal and respectable way for a woman to dress her hair. However, in Paul’s time, women normally did not braid their hair. Instead, they parted it in the middle, pulled it back, and fastened it with a pin or scarf.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>S. M. Baugh in <em>Women in the Church</em>, pages 47–48.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In 2:9c, Paul was referring to the elaborate hairstyles that wealthy women in Ephesus considered fashionable.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Hurley, page 199.</span></span> Paul said that Christian women should not wear their hair in these ways. Instead, they should wear their hair in a more simple arrangement.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If in your culture women do not braid their hair, you may want to follow the GNT, which says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>fancy hair styles</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Respectable women in many cultures do braid their hair. If this is true in your region, try to use a more general expression.</p><h4>2:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or gold or pearls</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>nor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should they wear</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">jewelry made of material such as</span> gold or pearls,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gold:</strong> Gold was a very valuable metal. Here Paul was referring to jewelry made from <em>gold</em> that women wore to decorate either their hair or their body.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pearls:</strong> The word <em>pearls</em> refers to small, round, white objects that grow inside the shells of oysters. They also are expensive, sometimes even more valuable than gold. Here Paul was referring to jewelry which included <em>pearls</em>. If <em>pearls</em> are unknown in your region, you will need to use a phrase like “expensive jewelry.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:9d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul was not telling the women that they should never wear jewelry. Instead, he was explaining what it meant in Ephesus to dress modestly (2:9a), and with decency and propriety (2:9b).</p></div><h4>2:9e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:9e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or expensive clothes,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>nor <span data-bnType=\"implied\">should they wear</span> extravagant clothes.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>expensive clothes:</strong> Paul was saying that believers should not dress in clothing that cost a lot of money. If they did so, people might think they were doing so just to show how wealthy and beautiful they were. In English, words like “extravagant,” “ostentatious,” and “showy” convey this meaning. It is the opposite of “respectable” in 2:9a.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:9c–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Different cultures differ in what they consider as modest, decent and proper clothing, hair styles and jewelry. Therefore, the details of Paul’s instructions do not apply to all women in every place in the world for all time. The important thing is that in every culture female believers should dress in a way that their culture considers to be proper.</p></div>",

For a more detailed rebuttal, see Schreiner in <em>Women in the Church</em>, pages 121–123.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in quietness:</strong> Paul did not mean that women should be totally silent in church.

Some people think that with the use of <em>de</em> here Paul is making a contrast, saying that “a woman <em>can</em> learn, but she <em>cannot</em> publicly teach the Scriptures to men or have authority over them.” However, that is not the point Paul is making. Paul stresses in 2:11 not just that a woman learn, but that a woman learn <em>in quietness and full submission</em>. Learning in quietness does not contrast with not permitting a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. Instead, it reinforces it.Some think that verses 11 and 12 are chiastic. Schreiner in <em>Women in the Church</em>, in footnote 88 on page 124, says, “I question whether there is a chiasm here because then the idea of exercising authority should have preceded teaching. Instead, the two verses are closely related, with an inclusio binding them together. Another problem with seeing a chiasm is that the scholars cited above do not agree on the chiastic arrangement.”</span></span> The chart below shows how the two verses are similar:</p><table style=\"min-width: 50px\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Verse 11</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Verse 12</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>a woman</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>a woman</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>let her learn</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>I do not permit…to teach</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>with full submission</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>or to have authority over a man</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>in quietness</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>be silent</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>2:12a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:12a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I do not allow any woman to teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other believers</span> or to rule over the men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the Christian community</span>.</p></li><li><p>I do not allow women to teach men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about God</span> or rule over them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I do not permit:</strong> Paul was not merely expressing his personal opinion.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Here I disagree with Phillips’ translation, which says, “Personally, I don’t allow…”</span></span> All through this section, he had been speaking as an apostle. This meant that God had given him the authority to tell believers what to do (see 2:1a, 2:8a, 2:9a). In this verse he continued speaking the same way. The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>I do not permit</em> meant that Paul was emphasizing that others should obey him.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a woman:</strong> That is, every woman, all women.

They say that Paul does not say anything here about women not exercising authority over men. Instead, they say that the word <em>or</em> indicates that women should not teach men <em>in an authoritative way</em>. But other people (like Douglas Moo in “What Does It Mean Not to Teach or Have Authority Over Men? 1 Timothy 2:11–15,” in <em>Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood</em>, page 187) point out that the Greek word <em>or</em> is not usually used in hendiadys. They say that Paul is prohibiting women from <em>both</em> teaching <em>and</em> exercising authority, whether done together or separately.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to exercise authority:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>to exercise authority</em> means that a person controls, dominates, or begins to exert authority over another person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kroeger and Kroeger say that one of the senses of the word “have authority” is “to represent oneself as the author, originator, or source of something.” So, they say that certain women were teaching that they were the originator of men, and that what Paul was forbidding here was not that women “teach or have authority over men” but that women “teach that they are the originator of man.” They continue to say that pagan thought in the area had long held that woman was the source of man. They also say that certain types of gnosticism known to have been taught in the area of Ephesus about 100 to 200 years after this time may have already been taught in less well-developed forms during Paul’s time. These types of gnosticism also taught that woman was the source of man. So, Paul was combating that false teaching in this verse.However, see the exhaustive study of this word by Baldwin in <em>Women in the Church</em>, pages 65–80, and his exhaustive study of the full context of each occurrence of the word known in Koine Greek, pages 269–305. According to Baldwin, the Kroegers’ claims as to the meaning of the Greek word “to have authority” is based on a misinterpretation of one of the attested meanings “to be primarily responsible for or instigate something.” Furthermore, the Kroegers’ theory is speculative, assuming that specific forms of later Gnostic teachings were also taught during the time which Paul wrote. See also Schreiner’s survey and critique of various positions in <em>Women in the Church</em>, pages 130–134.</span></span><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>John Stott, pages 74–81, draws a distinction between what is culturally conditioned and what are timeless principles in verses 8 through 15. He says that the timeless principles are that men should pray without sin, anger, or fighting, that women should dress modestly, and that women should be submissive to men. He says that the culturally conditioned elements are the <em>way</em> men pray (with lifted hands), the particular <em>way</em> women should not dress (with gold or braided hair), and the <em>way</em> women should be submissive to men (by being silent and not teaching). Further, on page 81, he distinguishes between two kinds of teaching roles. One is where the teacher is seen as an authority figure, and the other where the teacher is seen as a servant, under the authority of Scripture. He indicates that it would <em>not</em> be appropriate for a woman to be in the first role, but that a woman <em>would</em> be able to be in the second role without violating the principle of remaining in submission to men.Whereas I like Stott’s distinction between what is cultural and what is timeless, I think it would be hard for a woman to fill a pastoral role where she is the principle teacher without her also exercising authority over men. Even though she remains under the authority of Scripture and relates to the congregation as servant, she would need to speak with the authority of Scripture to declare what the word of God says. How would she be able to do the things which Paul tells Timothy to do, such as “command certain men not to teach false doctrines” (1:3), “command and teach these things” (4:11), publicly rebuke those who have sinned (5:20) and “command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant” (6:17), without exercising authority over them? Stott admits that such a woman should be “a member of a pastoral team whose leader is a man.” But this essentially undercuts what he says, because then the <em>man</em> would be the principle authoritative teacher, not the woman.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">This expression is similar to 2:11, where Paul said that women should learn in “full submissiveness.” Paul meant that women should not have authority over men in the Christian community. They were to submit to the authority of the male teachers, not try to rule over them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>over a man:</strong> Paul was still talking about men and women in general, not husbands and wives.

He implied that it was often easier for the devil to deceive women than it was for him to deceive men.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The view that women tend to be more easily deceived than men has historically been the more popular view. Modern western ideas make this interpretation unpopular, but I have not seen any other convincing interpretation of what Paul says here. For example, some people understand verse 14 to imply that Eve’s problem was not that she was deceived, but that she ate the fruit without consulting Adam, and then, by offering the fruit for Adam to eat, was taking an improper role by, in a sense, “teaching” him. Stott, page 81, promotes this view and says, “the essence of Eve’s part in the fall was not that she was deceived, but that she took an improper initiative, usurped Adam’s authority and thus reversed their respective roles.” However, the focus in verse 14 is on deception, not teaching. Eve stands not as a type of Ephesian women who were teaching false doctrine, but as a type of Ephesian women who were being deceived by false doctrine. If it were Paul’s point in verse 14 that Eve should not have been teaching Adam, it is strange that he should leave teaching unmentioned and refer only to her deception!Kroeger and Kroeger’s interpretation that these statements are actually combating proto-Gnostic teachings is attractive, but speculative. They say that Paul was combating the proto-Gnostic teaching which said that Adam had been tricked into thinking that he was created before Eve, that the God who had made the material universe was the highest God of all, and that he should worship this God. For more details and interaction with other views see Schreiner in <em>Women in the Church</em>, pages 140–146.Keener, in <em>Dictionary of Paul and His Letters</em>, page 591, says that Paul’s argument from Eve’s deception is likely to be ad hoc: “It is far more likely that Paul instead uses Eve to illustrate the plight of the particular women he addresses in Ephesus, who are easily deceived because they are untrained. Paul elsewhere uses Eve for <em>anyone</em> who is deceived, not just women (2 Cor 11:3).” However, the point remains that Paul is specifically referring to women here. Furthermore, Paul sets the context by referring to all women, not just untaught women, in 2:11 and 2:12a. See the notes on 2:11.</span></span> He said that the behavior of Eve and Adam was proof of this. If a woman is deceived, she may not teach what is true.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This does not mean that woman should never teach. In Titus 2:3–5 Paul wrote that women could teach other women. In 2 Timothy 1:5 and 3:14–15 he wrote that women should teach their children. However here Paul was saying that women should not teach <u>men</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it was not Adam who was deceived:</strong> Paul was referring to Genesis 3:1–13. These verses explain that Satan appeared to Eve as a snake. He tempted her to eat the only fruit that God had forbidden Adam and her to eat. The snake did not speak to Adam or deceive him. Adam chose to eat the fruit when Eve offered it to him.</p><h4>2:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but the woman who was deceived</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>It was the woman <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Eve</span> whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan</span> deceived.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but the woman who was deceived:</strong> The snake tricked or <em>deceived</em> Eve by causing her to disbelieve what God had said about the fruit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul’s point here was that Satan was able to deceive Eve more easily than he could deceive Adam.</p><h4>2:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and fell into transgression.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The result was</span> that she became a sinner.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fell into transgression:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>fell into transgression</em> means “<span data-bnType=\"implied\">deliberately</span> broke God’s law.” Eve did not obey God’s command.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kroeger and Kroeger say that this combats Gnostic teaching which said that Eve actually did a good thing when she ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They presume that people taught this in the time when Paul and Timothy lived.</span></span> She became a person who had disobeyed God.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:11–14</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul’s conclusion is in 2:12 and his reasons are in 2:13–14. However, in some languages, it is more natural to state reasons <u>before</u> the conclusion. If this is true in your language, you may need to combine and reorder the verses. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">When men teach about God,</span> women should learn by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">listening</span> quietly and respectfully. <sup>12–14</sup>For God made Adam before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he made</span> Eve. Also, Adam was not the one whom <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan</span> deceived. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Satan</span> deceived Eve and she disobeyed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span>. Therefore, I do not allow women to teach or have authority over men.</p></blockquote><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:14a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be necessary to conclude 2:14 with a sentence to summarize what Paul was saying. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Those are the reasons why women should not teach or have authority over men.</p></blockquote></div>",

If this interpretation is correct, then verse 15 fits perfectly with the emphasis we have seen in this text throughout.

For example, the NASB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>women will be preserved through the bearing of children <em>(NASB, NET, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Other versions are ambiguous. Neither interpretation is completely satisfactory. If it is possible for you to translate this expression in a neutral way, you should do so. However, we know that interpretation (2) is not true because Christian women do suffer pain, or even die, when they bear children. So, if you must choose an interpretation, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>however:</strong> The Greek particle <em>de</em>, which the BSB translates as <em>however</em> shows contrast. Although Eve “became a sinner,” God is able to save women from the consequences of Eve’s sin and of their own sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>childbearing:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>childbearing</em> literally refers to “giving birth to children.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some modern commentators say that the text here probably represents all aspects of a woman’s normal role in Paul’s day, including raising children and all the things that women normally do to manage a household. However, the UBS <em>Translator’s Guide</em> objects to this, saying “this broader interpretation of the Greek noun, though more acceptable to modern thinking, does not seem warranted; the related verb in 5:14 means quite specifically ‘to bear children,’ not ‘to rear children.’” However, it is possible that Paul used the verb figuratively as metonymy for raising children.</span></span></p><h4>2:15b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Here Paul described the way the women in 2:15a should act.</p><h4>2:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>if they continue in faith, love,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as long as they continue to believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>, love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>if they continue in:</strong> God wants people to act as believers continually: he wants them to show “faith”, “love”, and “holiness.” He does not want them to behave this way only occasionally.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>We note that this verb, <em>continue</em>, is plural in the Greek, whereas the verb <em>will be saved</em> is singular. However, the verb <em>will be saved</em> in 2:15a refers to women generically. So, when Paul switches to the plural here, he is not making a significant change. Paul did a similar thing when he referred to <em>men</em> in 2:8a in the plural, then switched in 2:12a to the singular, making a generic reference.</span></span> They need to persevere. Paul said a similar thing in Romans 11:22 and Colossians 1:23.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>they:</strong> This refers to the women mentioned in 2:15a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>faith</em> as a verb. It may then be necessary to provide an object for the verb. If this is true in your language, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love:</strong> In this verse, Paul did not say whom the women should love. There are three possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>He meant that the women should love other people</p></li><li><p>He meant that the women should love God</p></li><li><p>He meant that the women should love both God and other people</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is difficult to know which of these interpretations is best, and most English translations are ambiguous. If it is possible for you to translate this in the same ambiguous way, you should do so. However, if you must supply an object, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><h4>2:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and holiness, with self-control.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and behave in a pure and appropriate way.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holiness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>holiness</em> means to behave in a way that pleases God. It is the way he wants believers to behave. See holiness in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>self-control:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>self-control</em> means to act in a way that people consider correct, acceptable, or appropriate. Paul used the same word in 2:9b to describe the way in which women should dress.</p>",

See 1 Timothy 1:15, 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 1:9, 3:8. You should try to use the same expression of introduction in all these places. Paul used this expression to introduce a <em>saying</em> that was well-known among believers at that time.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>trustworthy:</strong> Paul said that what he was about to say was <em>trustworthy</em>. That means that it was true and reliable. Other ways to say this could be: “This saying really is true,” or “people should believe this.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>saying:</strong> A saying is an expression that is well known to people. In some languages it may be possible to use a word like “proverb.”</p><h4>3:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If anyone aspires to be an overseer,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If someone longs to become an overseer,</p></li><li><p>Any person who really wants to be an overseer <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of other believers</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If anyone aspires to be an overseer:</strong> This was a saying that was often repeated among the believers at that time. Timothy probably knew it well.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>If:</strong> This saying begins with <em>If</em>, which often means that the speaker is not sure whether something will really happen or not. However, in Greek and English, it can also be used when the speaker knows that the event happens sometimes. Here Paul was not wondering whether someone was going to wish to become an overseer or not. He was telling Timothy what to do when it happened. In some languages it may be better to say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The person who sets his heart on being an overseer [desires a noble task].</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>anyone:</strong> The Greek pronoun that the BSB translates as <em>anyone</em> here can include men and women. But it is clear from the list of requirements to be an overseer (3:2–7) that only men were overseers. So it is acceptable to translate this as “any man.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>aspires to:</strong> This Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>aspires to</em> literally means “stretches toward.” It means that a person strongly desires something.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>be an overseer:</strong> The Greek word <em>episkopē</em> that the BSB translates as <em>be an overseer</em> refers to the position of being an overseer.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>overseer:</strong> In the New Testament, the Greek word <em>episkopos</em> was one of the names used for the leader of a group of believers. Another name that the New Testament used for this kind of leader is the Greek word translated as “elder.” Paul used the word translated “elder” in 4:14c, 5:17a, and 5:19a. If you can use two different words, it is recommended that you do so. However, in some languages, using two terms may cause readers to think Paul was talking about two different groups of people. If this is so in your area, use the same term for both Greek words.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">English versions sometimes translate <em>overseer</em> by the word “bishop,” but this may be confused with the role of a bishop in the modern church. You should consider carefully what is the most appropriate term in your language. If there is already a church in your area, it may be best to choose the term already used for a church leader who teaches.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the rest of this paragraph, Paul explained some of the responsibilities of an overseer. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>he was responsible for teaching the believers (3:2)</p></li><li><p>he was responsible for caring for them (3:5)</p></li><li><p>he was responsible for leading them (3:5)</p></li></ol><h4>3:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>he desires a noble task.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>what he wants to do is very good.</p></li><li><p>desires to do something that is excellent.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he desires:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>desires</em> is a different word than the one translated as “aspires to” earlier in the verse. However they both mean that the person wants something strongly. In some languages it may not be possible to say that someone <em>desires</em> a job or a “task.” In such languages, it may be necessary to say “he desires <u>to do</u> [a noble task].”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a noble task:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>noble</em> literally means “good,” “fine.” Paul meant that it was a worthwhile thing to lead and teach believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>task:</strong> That is, “job,” “work,” “activity.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:1a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be helpful to reorder this verse so that Paul’s comment about the truthfulness of the saying comes after the saying itself. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is a saying <span data-bnType=\"implied\">among believers</span>: “If anyone longs to become an overseer, he desires to do something noble.” This saying can be trusted.</p></blockquote></div>",

He was describing the qualities that <u>each</u> overseer needed to have. In some languages it may be better to use plural forms here and in the rest of the list. For example, it may be better to say “<u>overseers</u> must be above reproach” rather than to say “<u>the overseer</u> must be above reproach.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek word <em>oun</em> that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> normally means “therefore.” It is not a time word. Paul used this word to begin the list of the character qualities a person should have if he wanted to become an overseer. Since it was noble to want to be an overseer, such people needed to fulfill certain qualifications. Another way to translate this connection could be “because of that,”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>must be above reproach:</strong> Paul said that overseers should behave well so that no one would be able to accuse them of doing something wrong. They should be people whom other people respected as men who behaved in a godly way. This word is also used in 5:7b and 6:14b.</p><h4>3:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the husband of but one wife,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must be</span> a faithful husband,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must be</span> a man who does not have sex with anyone other than with his wife.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the husband of but one wife:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the husband of but one wife</em> literally says “a one-wife husband” or “a one-woman man.” Scholars interpret this in two main ways:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a third interpretation followed by the NRSV, that is, an overseer must only be married once.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>An overseer must not be married to more than one woman at the same time; that is, he must not be polygamous. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he must have only one wife <em>(BSB, GNT, NIV, RSV, GW, NCV, KJV, NASB, REB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>An overseer must not have sex with anyone other than his wife; that is, he must not commit adultery. Many commentaries follow this interpretation. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>faithful to his wife <em>(NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either of these interpretations is possible. If an elder was not faithful to his wife, people would criticize him or criticize the church. So Paul wanted each church leader to be faithful to his wife. However, interpretation (2) is followed by several English versions. You may wish to follow the same interpretation as the version most in use in your area. It is recommended that whichever interpretation you choose, you mention the other in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also important to notice that the same Greek expression is used in Titus 1:6. Make sure that you translate both passages the same way.</p><h4>3:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>temperate, self-controlled,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>restrained, self-disciplined,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must be</span> able to control how he behaves in all situations.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>temperate:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>temperate</em> means “behaving in a sober, restrained manner.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida (88.87) on <em>nēphalios</em></span></span> It often refers to not drinking too much alcohol. But most commentators agree that the meaning is more general here. It includes not getting drunk, but it also refers to not losing control of oneself in any other way. The same word is used in 3:11c and Titus 2:2.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>self-controlled:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>self-controlled</em> means “being sensible and moderate in one’s behavior.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida (88.94) on <em>sōphrōn</em></span></span> It describes a person who thinks and acts wisely. Because the overseer is in control of himself, he is able to act calmly and appropriately in every situation. This word is also used to describe an overseer in Titus 1:8. It also occurs in Titus 2:2, 2:5–6, 2:12.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These two words translated <em>temperate</em> and <em>self-controlled</em> mean almost the same thing. They both refer to a person who can control the way in which he reacts to things or situations. Both words also occur together in Titus 2:2. Paul probably used both words together to emphasize that an overseer should be in control of himself in every area of his life. So, if you do not have two words to use in your translation, you could combine them and say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he should be self-controlled in everything he does</p></blockquote><h4>3:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>respected, kind to strangers, a good teacher,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must be</span> a person whom people respect. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must be</span> ready to welcome guests into his home. <span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must be</span> able to teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s message well</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>respectable:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>respectable</em> means “orderly,” “well-behaved,” or “virtuous.” It means that other people value and admire a person who is <em>respectable</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>hospitable:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hospitable</em> literally means “loving strangers.” An overseer must be a person who welcomes guests into his home. He may also give guests food or a place to stay for the night. This word is also used in Titus 1:8.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>able to teach:</strong> An overseer must be a person who is able to teach believers what Scripture means. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>able to teach</em> is also used in 2 Timothy 2:24.</p>",

Your language might express this with a single word, like the English word “drunkard,” or you may use an expression such as “someone who is always getting drunk,” or “habitual drinker.” See also Titus 1:7 where the same Greek word is used.</p><h4>3:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not violent but gentle,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>not fighting <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a lot</span>, but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">remaining</span> calm,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He must</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like to</span> fight.

The KJV follows that text. However, most scholars agree that this phrase was not present in Paul’s original letter to Timothy. So you should omit the words as the BSB has done.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Metzger, pages 640 and 641, indicates that the words “not greedy of filthy lucre” are a gloss derived from Titus 1:7 and were probably not present in the original. The Editorial Committee of the UBS New Testament (4<sup>th</sup> edition) does not list this reading in its critical apparatus.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not violent:</strong> The Greek word <em>plēktēn</em> that the BSB translates as <em>violent</em> means “striker, brawler.” This means a person who often fights with other people or who is rough with others in language or actions. It refers mainly to fighting physically, but it can include yelling and arguing too. An overseer must not lead the believers by forcing them to do things in this way. The same word is used in Titus 1:7.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but gentle:</strong> The Greek word <em>epieikēs</em> that the BSB translates as <em>gentle</em> is the opposite of “violent.” If a person is <em>gentle</em>, he is kind, patient, calm, and respectful.

In the following verses, Paul described the sort of people who should be deacons. Many of these qualifications are similar to those for overseers.</p></div><h4>3:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the overseers</span>, deacons also must be men who deserve respect and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they must</span> be honest.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Deacons:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Deacons</em> normally means “servants.” But in this verse it refers to believers who had a special job within the community of believers. Deacons basically took care of special needs of believers. For example, one of their tasks was to care for the widows.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate the word as “deacons,” but the GNT says “church helpers.” You should choose a term that is suitable in your culture for such a leadership job.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>likewise:</strong> Paul had given a list of qualifications for overseers in 3:1–7. He was now going to list the qualifications for deacons.(3:8–13). In some languages it may be enough to use the word “also.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>dignified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>dignified</em> is a general word. It means that a deacon must behave in a way that deserves respect from other people. That is, other people will esteem and honor him because he has earned that respect by the way he behaves.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not double-tongued:</strong> The Greek term that the BSB literally translates as <em>not double-tongued</em> means “sincere.” Another way to express this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>not saying things they do not mean (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>3:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or given to much wine</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They must</span> not <span data-bnType=\"implied\">habitually</span> drink <span data-bnType=\"implied\">too</span> much wine <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and become drunk</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>or given to much wine:</strong> Just as an overseer should not be “dependent on wine” (3:3a), Paul said that deacons should not be “given to much wine.” This means the same thing—any leader among believers must not get drunk.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wine:</strong> The word <em>wine</em> refers to a drink made from grapes. It is fermented and therefore alcoholic. During the time when Paul wrote this letter, people normally drank wine with their meals. Paul said that deacons should not drink too much wine and therefore become drunk.</p><h4>3:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or greedy for money.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They must</span> not be <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so</span> eager to get money <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that they</span> cheat <span data-bnType=\"implied\">others</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>greedy for money:</strong> In 3:3d, Paul said that overseers should be “free of the love of money.” Here Paul makes a similar statement about deacons. The Greek word <em>aischrokerdē</em> that the BSB translates as <em>greedy for money</em> literally means “shamefully greedy.” Scholars interpret this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It refers to people who do wrong things in order to get money. <em>(NIV, CEV, NCV, GW)</em> <em>This is also the view of many commentaries.</em></p></li><li><p>It refers to people who are greedy for money and possessions, whether or not the person does anything wrong to get them. <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NJB, NLT, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The Greek word that Paul used here contains a part that means “shameful, disgraceful.” So it probably refers to someone who is willing to lie, cheat or take bribes in order to get the money he wants. This kind of person might use his position of authority in the church as a way to get money from other people. One possible way to translate this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He must not be a person who will do anything to get money.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The same term is used in Titus 1:7 and 1:11.</p>",

In the following verses, Paul described the sort of people who should be deacons. Many of these qualifications are similar to those for overseers.</p></div><h4>3:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>In the same way, the women must be dignified,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the deacons themselves</span>, their wives must behave so that other people respect them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>In the same way:</strong> This verse begins with a Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>In the same way</em>. Paul also used this word in 3:8a where he began to list the requirements for deacons. In that verse the BSB translates it as “likewise.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the women:</strong> There is a major interpretation question in this verse. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the women</em> means “women” in some contexts and “wives” in other contexts. There is no special word that only means “wife.” Therefore, there are two possible ways to interpret this word and therefore this verse:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <em>wives</em> and therefore refers to the wives of the deacons. <em>(NIV, GNT, KJV, NET, GW, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>It means “women” and therefore refers to female deacons (deaconesses). <em>(BSB, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions are ambiguous but most of those that do choose an interpretation follow interpretation (1). Therefore it is recommended that you also translate this word as <em>wives</em>. Here are some reasons why Paul was probably referring to wives of deacons:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul talked about male deacons in 3:8–10, then he continued talking about male deacons in 3:12–13. Paul probably did not interrupt himself here to talk about female deacons. It is more likely that he was talking about the wives of the deacons.</p></li><li><p>Paul followed 3:11 by saying that a deacon (like an overseer) needed to be a “husband of one wife” (3:12a). If he had been referring to female deacons in 3:11a, he would probably have said that female deacons should be faithful to their husbands.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is impossible to be absolutely certain which interpretation is correct.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Fee, page 88, says, “This sentence is one of the genuine puzzles in 1 Timothy.”</span></span> If possible, you should explain both possibilities in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>dignified:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>dignified</em> is a general word. It means that these women must behave in a way that deserves respect from other people. That is, other people will esteem and honor them because they had earned that respect by the way they behave.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is the same word that Paul used in 3:8a. You should use the same term here.</p><h4>3:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not slanderers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They must</span> not say bad things about other people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>slanderers:</strong> When Paul said that deacons’ wives must not be <em>slanderers</em>, he meant that they must not gossip or say hurtful things about other people. It does not matter whether or not the things are true. If they are meant to be hurtful, the women should not say them. Paul used the same word in Titus 2:3. You should try to use the same term in both verses.</p><h4>3:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but temperate and faithful in all things.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they must be</span> self-controlled. They must be people whom other people trust in all situations.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>temperate:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>temperate</em> means “behaving in a sober, restrained manner.” It often refers to not drinking too much alcohol. But most commentators agree that the meaning is more general here. It includes not getting drunk, but also includes not losing control of themselves in any other way. The same word is used in 3:2c and Titus 2:2.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faithful:</strong> If a person is <em>faithful</em>, people can trust him to fulfill his responsibilities and to do what he promises. He is trustworthy, dependable, and reliable. Two ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person whom others trust</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person who always does what he says he will do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in all things:</strong> Most scholars and English versions agree that <em>in all things</em> is grammatically attached to the word <em>faithful</em>. So the BSB expression <em>faithful in all things</em> could be translated “completely faithful.”</p>",

If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p>",

The Greek verb is active (“I delay”) rather than passive (<em>I am delayed</em>). So it should not be translated as meaning that he might be held back by force. Paul knew that he might himself decide to wait.</p><h4>3:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you will know how each one must conduct himself in God’s household,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I still want</span> you to know how people should behave with <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other members of</span> God’s family,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> The connector <em>so that</em> introduces the purpose for which Paul was writing to Timothy. Paul wanted Timothy to know the way to teach the believers even if Paul himself could not come to visit.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>how each one must conduct himself:</strong> Paul was referring to the way that God wanted believers to behave. He was including himself, Timothy, and all other believers. Paul was especially referring to the way that believers should treat each other.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God’s household:</strong> This is a metaphor that refers to the community of believers. Believers are related to each other like brothers and sisters in a family. They are related to God like children are related to their father. Paul used the same Greek word for <em>household</em> here as he did in 3:12b.</p><h4>3:15c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which is the church of the living God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which is the community which belongs to God, who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">truly</span> lives,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which is the church of the living God:</strong> Paul here used a different description of God’s household (3:15b). It refers to the people who belong to the living God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>church:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>church</em> does not refer to a church building, but to all true believers. Together they form the assembly or community of God’s people. Avoid using a term that might suggest that Paul was referring to a building. Some ways of translating the term <em>church</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the assembly of God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the community of God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s family</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the notes on 3:5b and 5:16c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the living God:</strong> That is, God is alive and active. He is not like idols that never lived. The same phrase occurs in 4:10b. The other NT references are Matthew 16:16, 26:63; Acts 14:15; Romans 9:26; 2 Corinthians 3:3, 6:16; Hebrews 3:12, 9:14, 10:31, 12:22; Revelation 7:2.</p><h4>3:15d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:15d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the pillar and foundation of the truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>the pillar and foundation that supports the truth and makes it strong.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The church supports God’s</span> true <span data-bnType=\"implied\">message like</span> a pillar <span data-bnType=\"implied\">supports a building and it strengthens</span> the message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a foundation <span data-bnType=\"implied\">makes a building strong</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the pillar and foundation of the truth:</strong> This is a metaphor that explains that the church supported and strengthened the truth. The truth (of the gospel) was like a building, and the community of believers was like a pillar and foundation. Just as a pillar and a foundation support and strengthen a building, the community of believers supports and strengthens the truth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pillar:</strong> A <em>pillar</em> is a tall post, usually made of stone, that supports the roof of a building. The same Greek word is used in Galatians 2:9 and Revelation 3:12, 10:1. The picture below shows the way that pillars support the roof of a building.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foundation:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>foundation</em> does not occur anywhere else in the NT. So scholars do not agree about its precise meaning here. There are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It could mean <em>foundation</em> or ground, that is, something that is the base on which a building is erected. <em>(BSB, NIV, GW, CEV, NCV, KJV)</em></p></li><li><p>It could mean support, bulwark, or prop, that is, something that helps to hold a building up or protects it. <em>(GNT, RSV, NJB, NASB, NLT, REB, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The church is like the <em>foundation</em> of a building. The foundation of a building causes the building to remain strong.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the truth:</strong> When Paul mentioned <em>the truth</em>, he was referring to the gospel. See the note on <em>the truth</em> in 2:4b.</p>",

See the note there. Paul was referring to the true message that God has revealed to people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the rest of this verse, Paul explained the aspects of this mystery, The mystery is that God himself came to earth as Jesus. Paul called it <em>the mystery of </em><u><em>godliness</em></u> because when people understand it they want to be <u>godly</u>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>godliness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godliness</em> the way people behave when they respect God. See godliness, godly in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>great:</strong> The word <em>great</em> in English can have more than one meaning. In this verse it means “wonderful” or “awesome.”</p><h4>3:16b–g</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Here, Paul stated in six short lines what “the mystery of godliness” is. These six lines are possibly a hymn that the believers sang in Paul’s time, or they may be a creed that believers recited. To show this, you may want to print them on separate lines as some English versions have done.</p><h4>3:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He appeared in the flesh,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> became a human.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>He</em> literally means “who.” This suggests that this hymn/creed was part of a longer composition. Both the literal “who” and the BSB’s <em>He</em> are ambiguous: they could refer to either God or Christ. If it is possible in your translation to retain the ambiguity you should do so. If you must chose, you should use “Christ” or “Christ Jesus.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is also a textual issue as some manuscripts begin with the word “God” rather than “who”. The KJV follows this reading. However, the oldest manuscripts use “who” to start the hymn. The Editorial Committee of the UBS New Testament (4<sup>th</sup> edition) gives the reading with “who” an {A} rating, indicating that the text is almost certain.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>appeared in the flesh:</strong> That is, he “became a human” or “came to earth as a human being.”</p><h4>3:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>was vindicated by the Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He</span> was proved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to be the Son of God</span> by the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit.</p></li><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit showed that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he</span> really was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the Son of God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was vindicated by the Spirit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>vindicate</em> means “to prove that something or someone is right.” Therefore, when Paul said that Christ <em>was vindicated by the Spirit</em>, he meant that the Holy Spirit showed that Christ was the Son of God, as he claimed to be. Paul did not specify here in what way the Spirit vindicated Christ, so you should not say so either.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Spirit</em> probably refers to the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to use the normal term for “Holy Spirit” instead of simply “the Spirit” to make it clear.</p><h4>3:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>was seen by angels,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He was seen by angels.</p></li><li><p>Angels saw him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>was seen by angels:</strong> This could refer to several different events in Jesus’ life.

The term <em>glory</em> is used because God, who is awesomely bright, glorious and splendid, is in heaven. Versions that follow this interpretation use the preposition “into” or “to” before the word <em>glory.</em> For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he was taken up to glory <em>(CEV, GNT, KJV, REB, NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It refers to the <u>manner</u> in which God took Christ to be with him—in an amazing, powerful, glorious way. Versions that follow this interpretation usually use the preposition <em>in</em> before the word <em>glory.</em> For example, the NIV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>was taken up in glory <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NJB, NASB, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1): that God took Christ up to heaven.

They were teaching that believers should not marry and that there were certain kinds of food that they should not eat. Paul told Timothy several things that he should do to oppose the errors of the false teachers. For example:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>He should teach correct doctrines (4:11).</p></li><li><p>He should be a good example to others (4:12b).</p></li><li><p>He should read aloud the Scriptures to encourage the believers to obey them (4:13b).</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul wanted Timothy to continue to do these things and not become discouraged.</p></div><h4>4:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Now the Spirit expressly states</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Holy</span> Spirit plainly says</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> the Spirit has <span data-bnType=\"implied\">often</span> spoken these very clear words:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Now:</strong> This word indicates the way that this paragraph connects with what Paul had just said. It indicates a contrast. The church was “the pillar and foundation of the truth” (3:15d), and this truth “was believed on in the world” (3:16f). <u>Even though</u> that was true, some people were going to abandon this truth and even teach against it. If you have a suitable way in your language to indicate this connection you should use it here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was not writing to warn Timothy that <u>someday</u> false teachers would come to Ephesus. They were already there, as Paul had written in 1:3–7.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Spirit:</strong> That is, the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>expressly states:</strong> What the Holy Spirit communicated was clear, precise, and easy to understand.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>states:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>states</em> is in the present tense. Paul probably used the present tense in order to indicate that the Holy Spirit <u>often</u><span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>This is an instance of the customary or habitual present, which refers to “repeated activity on a regular or habitual basis.” See Perschbacher, page 281.</span></span> said this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was probably referring to the way that the Holy Spirit communicated through the prophets within the Christian community.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The Holy Spirit also revealed this information through Jesus’ teaching (see Mark 13:22 and Matthew 24:10–11).</span></span> And Paul himself had prophesied this in his farewell to the Ephesian elders recorded in Acts 20:29–30.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is not clear in the Greek text how much of the following verses was spoken by the Holy Spirit. It is recommended that you not make explicit where the quotation ends. If you have to make it explicit, you should probably make the quotation end at the end of 4:2.</p><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that in later times</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>that in these end days</p></li><li><p>In the time before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> returns</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>later times:</strong> Scholars understand the phrase that the BSB translates as <em>later times</em> in two main ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase refers to the time between Christ’s resurrection and his return. This period is sometimes called the “last days” in the Bible. So the <em>later times</em> were not still in the future in Paul’s day. They had already begun. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>during the last times <em>(NJB, KJV, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase refers to time that was <em>later</em> than or after the time when the Holy Spirit spoke the message. For example, the REB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in time to come <em>(BSB, REB, NIV, GNT, RSV, NASB, NET, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul was saying that people were already abandoning the faith even at the time when he was writing.

By itself it does not indicate good or evil.

See also 1 Corinthians 7:3–5, where Paul implied that there were people who were teaching that even married couples should not have sex. There have been people throughout history who have taught that sex is bad. Among these are the Essenes, the Encratites (described by Irenaeus), and Tertullian. For more details, see Stott, page 113.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul implied that it is wrong to forbid people to marry.

It does not refer to drinks. The false teachers were saying that there were some kinds of food that believers should not eat. For example, they may have been saying that it was not good to eat meat.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Paul used the same Greek word that he used here, <em>brōma</em>, to refer specifically to meat in Romans 14. The evidence that he was doing this is that he interchanged the word in that chapter with the Greek word <em>krea</em>, which can only mean “meat.” For example, in Romans 14:20, he said that people should not destroy the work of God for the sake of <em>brōma</em>. He continued teaching this point in Romans 14:21 by saying that therefore people should abstain from eating <em>krea</em> if they would offend another believer and damage him spiritually by eating meat.Note also that in Romans 14:2 Paul was using as an example the Christian whose faith was weak and who therefore ate only vegetables. This indicates that in this chapter he was contrasting people like that with people whose faith was stronger, so that they could eat meat without feeling guilty. It also indicates that when he spoke about <em>brōma</em> in Romans 14:20, he was referring to meat.In 1 Corinthians 8:13, Paul interchanged <em>brōma</em> in a single verse with <em>krea</em>. It is likely that Paul used <em>brōma</em> to refer specifically to meat here in 1 Timothy 4:2 also. If that is how he used this word here, then he was saying that the false teachers were saying that it was always wrong to eat meat.The main difference between the people who had weak faith, whom Paul described in Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8, and the false teachers against whom he was writing here in 4:3 is that the weak people did not teach other people that meat was inherently evil and that it was always wrong to eat it, as the false teachers taught. This difference was the main reason why Paul condemned the teaching of the false teachers here in 4:3 (see also Colossians 2:16–17, 2:21–23), in contrast with the gentle and considerate way that Paul recommended for strong believers to treat weaker believers in Romans 14 and 1 Corinthians 8. See Knight, page 190.</span></span> It is possible that they considered certain foods unclean or impure, as the Old Testament law had said.</p><h4>4:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">But</span> God made <span data-bnType=\"implied\">every kind of</span> food so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> those who believe and know his true message would accept the food and thank him for it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that:</strong> That is, the kinds of food that the false teachers were telling the believers not to eat.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to be received:</strong> God created food for people to eat.

Greek, English, Spanish, and probably many other European languages use this (and other devices) for gentle suggestions. For instance, we all react to the sentence “If we confess our sins, he will cleanse us” as meaning “We should confess our sins, since he will cleanse us.” Notice the mismatching between the surface grammar and the meaning which it expresses. Grammatically, the sentence is made up of a dependent conditional clause attached to an independent clause. Semantically, however, the relationship is reversed; that is, the <em>central</em> appeal unit is expressed by the dependent clause, and the <em>supporting</em> motivational unit is expressed by the independent clause. This mismatching between the grammar and the meaning is a device for making the exhortation or command a gentle one.”</span></span> Other ways to express this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In pointing out these things (NASB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>when you point these things out (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>pointing out:</strong> In this context, Paul meant that Timothy should make the other believers aware of “these things.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>these things:</strong> It is not clear what <em>things</em> Paul was referring to here. It could be:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the things that Paul had mentioned immediately before this, that is, in the previous section (4:1–5). Paul was giving the reasons why it was acceptable to eat any kind of food.</p></li><li><p>all the instructions that Paul had given in the letter so far.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most translations do not make clear what <em>these things</em> refer to. It is recommended that you also leave this ambiguous if you can. However, Paul was probably emphasizing at this point what he had written about immediately before this in 4:1–5. So if it is necessary for you to make a choice here, it is recommended that you translate <em>these things</em> in a way that refers to the immediately preceding verses.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>brothers:</strong> The word <em>brothers</em> refers to believers, or other Christians. This term probably includes both men and women. In your translation, you can say “all the other believers” or “all the brothers and sisters.”</p><h4>4:6b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you will be serving Christ Jesus in an excellent way.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you do this,</span> you will be serving Christ Jesus well.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a good servant of Christ Jesus:</strong> There are several interpretations of what Paul meant when he said that he expected Timothy to be <em>a good servant of Christ Jesus</em>. The two most likely meanings are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>He expected Timothy to <u>do</u> <u>the work of</u> Christ by teaching others. In other words, he expected Timothy to do what Christ wanted and commanded.</p></li><li><p>He expected Timothy to be a person whom Christ <u>appointed</u> to teach and help others.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you use a general expression here rather than making one of these interpretations explicit. But if you must be specific, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul referred to <em>Jesus</em> as <em>Christ Jesus</em> instead of “Jesus Christ.” The names “Christ Jesus” and “Jesus Christ” refer to the same person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some people, however, think that when Paul used the word <em>Christ</em> before the word <em>Jesus</em>, as in <em>Christ Jesus</em>, he was emphasizing that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In most English versions “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated in the same order as they occur in the Greek manuscripts. It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that, in some languages, people may be confused to see the names in two different orders. They may even think that Paul was referring to two different people. If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><h4>4:6c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>nourished by the words of faith and sound instruction</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Also <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> will nurture/train you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">by means of</span> the faith and the good teaching</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nourished by:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>nourished by</em> is a word used when referring to rearing a child.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The word in Greek is <em>entrephō</em>. Some people, including Louw and Nida, BAG, and NEB understand this to refer primarily to being trained. Louw and Nida (33.242) translate the active form of this word as, “to provide instruction and training, with the implication of skill in some area of practical knowledge—‘to train, to teach.’” BAG gives as the definition, “<em>bring up</em>, <em>rear</em>, then <em>train in something</em>.” Newman gives the definition for the middle form as, “live on, feed oneself on.” Knight (page 194), referring to Robertson, mentions that this word “was used by Plato (<em>Leges</em> 7.798a) of those who are ‘nourished in the laws.’” Arichea and Hatton (page 97) say that it refers to both nourishing and training: “The word for <em>nourished</em> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; the metaphor very likely comes from child rearing and pertains to all the activities that have something to do with the nurturing of a child, such as feeding and training.”</span></span> In this context, it is a metaphor that means “being trained by.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was saying that when Timothy taught other believers, God would use those teachings to train not only the listeners but also Timothy himself.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the words:</strong> The expression <em>the words</em> is connected to both “the faith” and “the good teaching.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> Here, <em>faith</em> refers to Christianity. In other words, it refers to all that God revealed to people concerning what we should believe and do in order to follow Christ properly. See the note on <em>faith</em> at 3:9. See faith, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sound instruction:</strong> The <em>sound instruction</em> refers to the true teaching about God. It contrasts with the false teaching that Paul had been warning Timothy about.</p><h4>4:6d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:6d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that you have followed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which you have obeyed.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that you have followed:</strong> That is, that Timothy had chosen to listen to and obey.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:6a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may better to reorder this verse. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>6a</sup>Teach these things to the brothers, <sup>6c–d</sup>and the truths of the faith and the good teaching you follow will nourish/train you. <sup>6b</sup>In this way you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus.</p></blockquote></div>",

Paul told Timothy that he should study and obey the truths of the faith. He should <em>reject:</em> false teachings.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>irreverent, silly myths:</strong> Paul said that the false teachings were really only <em>myths</em>. A <em>myth</em> is a story that has been made up and passed down from one generation to another and taught to the people. It may be based on something that happened in the past or it may be something made up to explain why people follow certain customs. But it is not true like history. See the note on 1:4a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>irreverent:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>irreverent</em> means that these myths did not help people to respect God. See godless, Word 2, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>silly myths:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>silly myths</em> is literally “old wives’ tales.” That is a common idiom in English as well as Greek. It refer to foolish stories, or to stories that are not worth telling. However, the term did not imply that women or old people were foolish. Paul was simply using a common term for a story that was not worth believing or even telling. If you have an idiom that is used for similar stories, you may be able to use it here. Otherwise it is recommended that you use a general expression like “silly” as the BSB has done.</p><h4>4:7b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:7b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Instead, train yourself for godliness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">constantly</span> train yourself to behave as God wants you to.</p></li><li><p>Instead, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">constantly</span> learn to obey God in everything.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Instead:</strong> This is the way that the BSB translates the Greek word <em>de</em> that connects 4:7a with 4:7b. Many English versions leave the connection implicit. The connection between 4:7a and 4:7b is that <u>instead of</u> paying attention to worthless teachings (4:7a), Timothy should train himself to be godly (4:7b).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>train yourself:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>train</em> refers to doing regular and intense physical exercise to prepare for a sport or athletic contest. Paul used this figure of speech to describe the continual effort and discipline that is needed to behave in a way that pleases God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be possible to use a word that relates to sports in order to talk about a person’s spiritual life. Other languages may not even have the concept of training for a sport. If this figure of speech will not work in your language, you could say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead, constantly be forming good habits in order to behave like God wants you to.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>godliness:</strong> Paul had already used the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godliness</em> in 2:2c A person who practices <em>godliness</em> expresses his faith by what he does; he behaves in a way that shows that he respects God.

He was indicating that he was quoting a saying that was probably known to Timothy and other believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">However, in this chapter, scholars do not agree about the contents of the saying. There are two main views:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The saying is in 4:8. The CEV indicates that it is following this option by placing quotation marks in 4:8.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, page 198, says, “The following considerations have convinced me that v. 8 is the saying: V. 8 looks like a proverbial saying, a point acknowledged by those who opt for v. 10. It contains two unique words, <em>γυμνασία</em> [=‘exercise’] (a NT hapax) and <em>σωματικός</em> [=‘bodily’] (only here and Lk. 3:22 in the NT), whereas v. 10 contains none, and it is more stereotyped in form than v. 10. V. 9 urges a personal response to the saying with the words ‘worthy of full acceptance,’ words that are only added to the citation-commendation formula when the note of personal response is not contained in the saying itself (see the comments on 1:15; <em>Faithful Sayings</em>, 30, 143f.), which is the case with v. 8, but not with v. 10, with its first person plural (‘we’) verbs….V. 10 does seem to be a more lofty theological statement than v. 8 and does include the note of salvation found in other ‘faithful sayings’ (e.g., 1 Tim. 1:15), but certainly v. 8 is equally significant as a theological statement, and the concept of salvation is not present in all the ‘faithful sayings’ (e.g., 1 Tim. 3:1; cf. also 2 Tim. 2:11–13). And form is a surer guide than content. Finally, the foil statement in v. 8a, <em>γὰρ σωματικὴ γυμνασία πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐστὶν ὠφέλιμος</em> [=‘for bodily exercise for a little is profitable’] can be better explained as part of a ‘saying.’”</span></span> However, most other versions only indicate that they follow this interpretation by the way they word the verse or by the punctuation they use. <em>(BSB, CEV, GNT, NJB, RSV, KJV, NASB, NET, NCV, NLT, GW)</em> <em>Most commentators also support this view.</em></p></li><li><p>The saying is found in 4:10. <em>(NIV, REB)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as it is supported by the majority of scholars.</p><h4>4:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For physical exercise is of limited value,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For it is somewhat useful to exercise your body,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">You should do this</span> because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as you know,</span> it is quite good for a person to train himself so that his body becomes strong.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> connects 4:8 with 4:7. It explains the reason that it was important for Timothy to train himself to be godly (4:7b).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>physical exercise:</strong> This phrase refers to the way an athlete trains his body to become strong. Paul used the same word for <em>exercise</em> here as he used in the expression “train yourself” in 4:7b. However here he added the word that the BSB translates as <em>physical</em>, that is, “bodily.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is of limited value:</strong> When Paul said that physical training <em>is of limited value</em>, he meant that physical training did benefit people in some way. However, he made it clear in 4:8b that godliness benefited people more. Physical training helps people only while they are alive on earth. Godliness helps people now and also after they die.</p><h4>4:8b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but godliness is valuable in every way,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>but to be godly is useful for everything,</p></li><li><p>But it is better for a person to try hard to behave like God wants him to behave,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> indicates that there is a contrast between physical training (4:8a) and spiritual training (4:8b).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>godliness:</strong> Paul was still talking about training, but now the emphasis was on <u>spiritual</u> training. As the note on “godliness” in 4:7b said, the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godliness</em> refers to the way people behave when they respect God. See godliness, godly in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>is valuable in every way:</strong> This contrasts with the words that the BSB translates as “is of some value” in 4:8a.</p><h4>4:8c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>holding promise for the present life and for the one to come.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because this helps a person both while he is alive on this earth and also after he dies.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holding promise:</strong> This part of the verse explains the way in which “godliness has value for all things” (4:8b). It is because it <em>holds promise</em>. This means that when a person trains himself in godliness, he can be sure that there will be a reward (from God).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the present life and for the one to come:</strong> This verse does not state what the rewards might be. But it does say that there will be rewards both before and after a person dies. The CEV has one way to express this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It promises life now and forever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used a saying that was well known to the believers at that time. He had done the same thing in 1:15a and 3:1a.</p>",

When it occurs with an infinitive (Acts 26:16) or with a <em>hina</em> (John 18:37 x2; Acts 9:21; 1 John 3:8; Romans 14:9; 2 Corinthians 2:9; 1 Peter 3:9, 4:6), it points forward in the sentence. When it occurs with an indicative verb (Mark 1:38; 1 Thessalonians 3:3) it points back to a previous proposition. It occurs with <em>hoti</em> only here and in 1 Peter 2:21. In 1 Peter 2:21 it clearly points back. Consequently, it is likely that it points back here in 1 Timothy 4:10, also. BAG comments on the construction in its entry for <em>houtos</em>, page 596, saying, “1. b. In particular, the neut. is used <em>α</em>. w. ref. to what precedes:….Freq. w. prepositions…<em>dia</em> <em>touto</em>…<em>eis</em> <em>touto</em>…<em>ek</em> <em>toutou</em>….” Knight, page 202, says, “V. 10 begins with two transition terms, <em>εἰς</em> <em>τοῦτο</em> and <em>γὰρ</em>. <em>εἰς</em> <em>τοῦτο</em> …has reference to the promise and its content. <em>γὰρ</em> ‘shows that this verse is to serve as a reason or confirmation of the preceding thought that godliness is profitable for all things…’ (Huther). Both terms bridge over v. 9 to v. 8 and tie v. 10 very closely with v. 8.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>labor:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>labor</em> often refers to physical work like working in a field. However, in this context, Paul was not talking about literal working. See the next note on “strive.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>strive:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some translations, such as the KJV and NLT, follow a version of the Greek text that says “suffer reproach” instead of <em>strive</em>. The majority of the editorial committee for the UBS Greek New Testament (4<sup>th</sup> edition) chose the variant “struggle.” However, they gave it a {C} reading, which means that the Committee had difficulty in deciding which variant to place in the text. Metzger, page 642, says, “A majority of the Committee preferred the latter [‘struggle’] partly because it has slightly better attestation and partly because it seems better suited to the context.” Most English versions follow the UBS text here.</span></span> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>strive</em> often refers to competing in an athletic contest or to fighting as a soldier does.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>He also used the same verb in 1 Corinthians 9:25, where it clearly refers to competing as an athlete.</span></span> In this context, Paul probably meant the verb to mean “fight, struggle” rather than “compete as an athlete.” Paul used the same verb in 6:12a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">As with the verb that the BSB translates as <em>labor</em> Paul did not use this verb literally.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These two words translated <em>labor</em> and <em>strive</em> mean almost the same thing. Paul used both to emphasize the tremendous effort that he and Timothy exerted in order to be godly. In some languages it may be necessary to combine these two terms into one expression, For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>for this we work very hard</p></blockquote><h4>4:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because we have set our hope on the living God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because we<sup>(incl)</sup> trust in God, who truly lives,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> is <em>hoti</em>. This word can have many different meanings. Here, it means “because.” For example, see the RSV and the GNT. Paul used this word to introduce a detailed explanation of 4:10a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we have set our hope on:</strong> This means that Paul and Timothy trusted in God. They believed that God would save them and give them the eternal life that he had promised to give them. The form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>have set our hope on</em> implies that this was something that they were doing continually.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our:</strong> This again refers to Paul, Timothy, and the Ephesian believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the living God:</strong> Paul used this expression here in the same way that he used it in 3:15c. In both verses, he used the expression to emphasize that God is active. The next part of this verse, 4:10c, says that God is active in the sense that he “saves” us.</p><h4>4:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who is the Savior of everyone,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who is the Savior of all people,</p></li><li><p>He is the one who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is able to</span> save everyone,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Savior of everyone:</strong> Paul and Timothy put much effort into obeying God. He said here that that was because God was the <em>Savior of everyone</em>. This means that God is the only one who can save all people, and that he is able and willing to do so.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Savior:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>Savior</em> refers to a person who rescues someone from danger. In this context, Paul was talking about God, who rescues us from the consequences of our sin. See the note on “our Savior” in 1:1c and the note on “save” in 1:15c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>everyone:</strong> Paul wanted to emphasize that God wanted to save everyone, not just a certain kind or group of people.</p><h4>4:10d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:10d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and especially of those who believe.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and particularly of those who believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and who does save</span> those who trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in him</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>especially:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>especially</em> is <em>malista</em>. In this context, it means <em>especially,</em> that is, “particularly,” or “above all.”<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Another possible meaning for <em>malista</em> is “that is” or “in other words.” Several modern commentators follow this interpretation. Paul was stating more exactly who the people are whom God saves. They are the people who believe. Knight, page 203, says, “Skeat (‘Especially the Parchments’) argues persuasively that <em>μάλιστα</em> [=‘especially’] in some cases…should be understood as providing a further definition or identification of that which precedes it and thus renders it by such words as ‘that is.’ He cites several examples from papyrus letters that would seem to require this sense and that would in their particular cases rule out the otherwise legitimate alternate sense.” See Skeat, T. C., “ ‘Especially the Parchments’: A Note on 2 Timothy IV.13,” <em>Journal of Theological Studies</em> 30 (1979) 173–177.</span></span> This is the normal meaning of the Greek word. It is true that God is the Savior of all people (4:10c). That is, he is the only one who can save people and he is able and willing to do that. But God is <em>especially</em> the Savior of believers in the sense that he has actually saved them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>believe:</strong> To <em>believe</em> means to trust in Christ, which also implies to obey him.</p>",

Therefore, some people thought that he was too young to teach them so they didn’t want to obey him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The form of the Greek verb is a third-person command. It could better be expressed in English as “May no one look down on you.” Paul was telling Timothy that he should behave in ways that made him deserve respect. Then people would respect him and not look down on him. The next verses told Timothy how to do this. Use a form of the verb in your language that will best fit this context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>despise:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>despise</em> means “regard as worthless,” “show disrespect to,” or “regard as inferior.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>youth:</strong> Timothy was probably between thirty and forty years old when Paul wrote this letter. Try to use a word for <em>youth</em> that includes Timothy’s age group. In some cultures, people do not consider a man of this age group a <em>youth</em>. If this is true in your area, you may need to state that some people <u>thought</u> that Timothy was <u>too</u> young to teach them.</p><h4>4:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but set an example for the believers</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and be a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> model for the believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to follow</span>.</p></li><li><p>You must behave in a way that the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> believers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> can copy.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>set an example:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as example means a “model” or “pattern.” Paul wanted Timothy to behave in a way that other believers could copy. If he did that, people would respect him and would listen to what he taught them, even though they considered him young.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>an example:</strong> In some languages there is no noun that means <em>example</em>. In such languages it may be possible to use a verb like “demonstrate” or “show.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead, show the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> believers how to behave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as God wants them to</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>4:12c–d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul wanted Timothy to be an example to the other believers in the way he behaved. In the rest of this verse Paul listed five ways in which Timothy was to be an example.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some translations, such as the KJV, add a sixth way, the words “in spirit”, after “in faith” in 4:10d. However, the oldest and best Greek texts that Bible scholars know about do not have the words “in spirit” here. That is why most modern translations do not include this phrase.</span></span></p><h4>4:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in speech, in conduct,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Always speak what is right and behave correctly.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Show them by your example</span> how to speak and how to behave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as believers should</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in speech:</strong> This is the first way in which Timothy was to be an example. Paul meant that Timothy should be careful that everything he said was true, kind, and helpful to others. He should avoid lying or gossiping.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in conduct:</strong> This is the second way in which Timothy was to be an example to the other believers. Paul meant that Timothy should behave in a way that pleased God and that others could imitate. Other believers should not have any reason to criticize him for his behavior.</p><h4>4:12d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:12d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in love, in faith, in purity.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>. Trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span>. Do not sin.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Show them</span> how to love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span>, how to trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span>, and how to live without sinning.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in love:</strong> This is the third way in which Timothy was to be an example to the other believers. Paul meant that Timothy should be an example to other people by loving them. Here Paul was probably referring to loving people more than to loving God. So if you need to use a verb here with an object, you should say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in the way you love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in faith:</strong> This is the fourth way in which Timothy was to be an example to the other believers. Paul told Timothy to be an example to other people <em>in faith</em>. He meant that Timothy should be an example in the way he trusted in God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>There is a second possibility here. Rather than talking about faith in God, Paul meant that Timothy should be faithful to his calling. Knight, page 206, says “The previous and following usages of <em>πίστις</em> [=‘faith’] as a Christian virtue coupled with <em>ἀγάπη</em> [=‘love’] and other virtues in the PE [=Pastoral Epistles] (see above) incline one to understand <em>πίστις</em> here as “faith,” i.e., “trust,” as do the preponderance of cases elsewhere in Paul (e.g., 1 Tim. 2:15; 6:11; 2 Tim. 2:22; 3:10; Gal. 5:6, 22, but for a contrary view on Gal. 5:22 cf. the commentaries of Burton and Bruce).”</span></span> See faith, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in purity:</strong> This is the fifth and final way in which Timothy was to be an example to the other believers. Paul meant that Timothy was always to behave in a pure way. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>purity</em> often refers to avoiding sexual sin in particular. However in this context, it probably refers to avoiding any kind of sin, including sexual sin.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:12b–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder this verse. For example, you could begin with the list of the ways in which Timothy should be an example. Here is one way to do that:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>12c</sup>speak <span data-bnType=\"implied\">what is right</span>, behave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in a way that pleases God</span>, <sup>12d</sup>love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>, trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in God</span>, and behave in a blameless way. <sup>12b</sup>Then you will be an example to the other believers.</p></blockquote></div>",

He also told Timothy to use the gift that God had given him (4:14a). This gift was the ability that God had given him to teach and to lead other people. Paul also told Timothy to keep progressing spiritually (4:15c), and to persevere (4:16b).<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Adapted from Stott, pages 120–125.</span></span></p></div><h4>4:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not neglect the gift that is in you,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Remember <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do the task that God has given</span> you the special ability for.</p></li><li><p>Never stop doing the work <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which God made</span> you able to do</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not neglect:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>neglect</em> means “ignore, be unconcerned about.” Therefore, to <em>not neglect</em> something means to pay attention to it. Paul wanted Timothy to remember to use his gift. In some languages you may need to say this positively instead of negatively. For example, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Pay attention to [your gift]</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gift that is in you:</strong> This refers to some kind of special ability or talent that God gave to Timothy through the Holy Spirit. Paul did not make explicit what this gift was because, of course, Timothy already knew what it was. It probably included an ability to teach and preach.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, there is no noun that means “ability.” If this is true in your language, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the work that God made you able to do</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful to use a word for “work” that can include activities such as teaching and preaching.</p><h4>4:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which was given you through the prophecy spoken over you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This is the ability</span> that you received through a message from God</p></li><li><p>since you received <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> message about it</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:14b–c, Paul reminded Timothy about the way that he had received his gift from God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which was given you:</strong> If you need to supply a subject here, you should say that God gave Timothy the gift.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prophecy spoken over you:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>prophecy</em> refers to special messages that the Holy Spirit gives to people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was probably referring to a <em>prophecy</em> that one (or more) of the elders had received from God (4:14c). God probably told them to tell Timothy that God had given him the ability to preach and teach.

This ceremony was intended to show the other believers in Ephesus that God had given Timothy those abilities.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Scripture does not say where the elders placed their hands, but it was probably on Timothy’s head.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of the elders:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the elders</em> refers to a group or council of elders.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>elders:</strong> This term refers to leaders of a local group of believers.

He was not telling him to do something new. Paul was commanding Timothy to <u>continue</u> to pay careful attention to his behavior and what he taught.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your life:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>your life</em> is literally “yourself.” This refers to behavior. Paul was telling Timothy to pay attention to the way that he behaved as a believer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>your teaching:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>teaching</em> refers to the facts that Christians should believe about God and Christ.

At the time when Paul was writing this letter, widows usually had no goods or services to exchange for food or clothing. They had to receive care from close family. A widow with no husband or other close family had no way to feed or clothe herself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>who are truly widows:</strong> This refers to widows who did not have children or grandchildren who could care for them. The BSB’s literal translation could be confusing, because although a widow could have several wealthy children, she is, of course, still a widow. However she does not need support from the church because her family can care for her. So it is recommended that you do not translate the Greek literally here but follow the NIV (“widows who are really in need”) or the GNT (“widows who really are all alone.”)</p>",

This contrast is between two types of widows. The first type is a widow whom the church should not assist because she has a family (5:4). The second type is a widow whom the church should assist (5:5). The BSB leaves the particle untranslated.

If this is true in you language, you could begin:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>No widows should be enrolled who…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was now only talking about those widows who had no family to help them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>should be enrolled:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>should be enrolled</em> translates a Greek word that occurs only here in the New Testament. It means “enrolled, enlisted.” It seems that the believers kept a list of Christian widows. This was probably a list of the widows for whom the believers regularly provided.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The widows on this list probably <u>did</u> have a duty to spend their time serving people in special ways. Perhaps they did some of the things which Paul mentioned in 5:10a–f, such as raising children (perhaps orphans), showing hospitality, helping those in trouble, and doing other good deeds. Knight, pages 222 and 223, says, “So a church may have a list of elderly and godly widows who have no one else to care for them and who commit themselves to serving Christ. The church commits itself to assist these widows and in turn may ask them to perform certain tasks as need arises. Noting all the dimensions of this arrangement keeps one from drawing the false conclusion that the church does not help other widows who are either younger or who do not fully meet the requirements. But the passage does imply that the church enters into this permanent arrangement only with certain qualified widows and with mutually accepted commitments and possible responsibilities. Noting all the dimensions of the arrangement also guards against the erroneous conclusion that Paul is mandating a widows’ organization in the church. The teaching of the passage is, rather, that the church only provides for widows which families do not. Thus, where every widow is provided for by her family there is no need for such a list. If, however, there needs to be a list, these are the requirements.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>enrolled:</strong> In some languages, the concept of enrolling widows on a <u>list</u> may be difficult to translate. If this is true in your language, you could try translating using an expression like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>should be included in the group of widows <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom the believers regularly help</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>at least sixty years old:</strong> At the time when Paul wrote, people considered those who had reached sixty years of age to be old people. Women who were over sixty years old did not usually remarry.</p><h4>5:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the wife of one man,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">She must also</span> have been faithful to her husband.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the wife of one man:</strong> This is the second condition that a widow had to meet before being added to the list of widows. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the wife of one man</em> can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>She should have had sexual relations only with her husband (or husbands) and no one else. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>faithful in marriage <em>(CEV, NIV, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>She should have had only one husband her entire life, without ever remarrying. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she must have been married only once <em>(GNT, RSV, NET, REB, NJB, KJV, NASB, GW)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>See Kelly, page 116, for a defense of this second interpretation.</span></span></em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In 5:14a Paul recommended that younger widows remarry, so interpretation (2) is less likely. Also, Paul used the same Greek expression here that he used in 3:2b (except that here he said “woman” instead of “man”). It is therefore recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p>",

In John 13:1–17, Jesus showed that washing someone else’s feet was an act of humility and love and that it was something believers should do for one another. However, in this context, scholars disagree about whether this expression should be understood:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>literally <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NJB, KJV, NASB, REB, NET, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>figuratively. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>served other Christians humbly <em>(GNT, CEV, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and translate this literally. Paul was listing some specific good deeds and there is no reason to assume that he was speaking figuratively.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If your readers will not understand the reason that someone might wash someone else’s feet, you might need to add an explanation or a cross reference to John 13:1–17 in a footnote.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the saints:</strong> The Greek word for <em>saints</em> literally refers to “the holy ones” or “the sanctified ones.” The word <em>saints</em> refers to someone who believes in Christ.</p><h4>5:10e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>imparting relief to the afflicted,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and she helps people who have problems.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>imparting relief to the afflicted:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>the afflicted</em> refers to people who are in distress, who are suffering in some way, or who are experiencing hardship/difficulties.</p><h4>5:10f</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:10f\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and devoting herself to every good work.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>She must have done many different things to help people.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is,</span> she must be continually helping people in different ways.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>devoting herself to every good work:</strong> This is a general statement that summarizes what Paul had just been saying. The widow must have been faithfully and consistently showing all sorts of kindness to people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>devoting herself to:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>devoting herself to</em> means that she should occupy her time with doing good deeds or that she should work diligently to do good deeds.

This word only occurs here in the New Testament. It implies that Paul did not expect these young women to be able to discipline or restrain their physical (sexual) desires. He expected these desires to grow and to become stronger than the women’s desire to serve Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul refers to Jesus only using the name <em>Christ</em>. It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><h4>5:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>they will want to marry,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they want to marry <span data-bnType=\"implied\">again</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>they will want to marry:</strong> It seems that these younger widows promised in some way that they would serve Christ as widows for the rest of their lives without remarrying. However later on, they change their mind. Paul was saying that it was not realistic for young widows to promise this because most young widows would want to remarry.</p>",

But <em>(a)</em> his Corinthian ruling was given many years previously, and it is agreed that as he grew older his sense of the nearness of the Parousia became dimmer; and <em>(b)</em> that ruling was in any case a general one, whereas here he is dealing with the very special case of widows. It is clearly his view that it is ideally better for anyone, man or woman, whose partner has died to avoid a second marriage, but his good sense and realism make him encourage second marriages where the strain involved in remaining single would be too great. This, as a matter of fact, is exactly the position he adopts in I Corinthians, where we find him (vii. 9; 36) specifically recommending marriage for <em>(a)</em> unmarried people and widows, and <em>(b)</em> partners in spiritual celibacy, provided they find it impossible to control their passions.”</span></span> He did so because he especially did not want the young widows to face the temptations listed in 5:11–13.</p><h4>5:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>have children,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and have children,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>have children:</strong> That is, to give birth to children.

Use a natural way in your language to indicate that this is a summary. For example, you could start the verse with a phrase like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I say again…</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>If any believing woman has dependent widows,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ If any woman who believes <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> has widows in her family,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">So,</span> women who believe <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span> who have any widows in their family</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>If any believing woman has dependent widows:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some of the older translations, like the KJV, say “man or woman,” instead of only saying “woman.” The KJV says, “If any man or woman that believeth have widows….” However, “woman” is probably the correct text. The Editorial Committee of the UBS New Testament (4 <sup>th</sup> edition) gives the reading “believing woman” a {C} rating, indicating that the Committee had difficulty in deciding which variant to place in the text. Metzger, page 642, says, “…a majority of the Committee, observing that the shorter reading is somewhat better attested than the longer reading, regarded the latter as a natural expansion made by copyists who, in light of ver. 4, felt that a restriction of the principle of this verse to Christian women was unfair.”</span></span> Paul knew that some of the believing women in Ephesus had widows in their families. Therefore, in some languages, it will not be possible to use an “if” clause here. If that is true in your language, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believing women who have widows in their families should…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>believing woman:</strong> Paul only mentioned women believers here. However, 5:8 makes it clear that men also had this duty. See the note on 5:8a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dependent widows:</strong> Paul used <em>widows</em><sup>(plur)</sup> here because a woman might have more than one widow to care for. For example, she may need to care for her mother, her mother-in-law and her grandmother.</p><h4>5:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>she must assist them</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>she should <span data-bnType=\"implied\">be the one to</span> help them</p></li><li><p>should care for them.</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and not allow the church to be burdened,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and not expect the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> believers to take that responsibility.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They should</span> not leave it to the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> believers to provide for them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>not allow the church to be burdened:</strong> This phrase indicates that believers should not need to care for widows who had families of their own. A literal translation would be difficult in many languages. Some ways that may make the meaning clearer are, For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>it is not right for her to ask the church to take care of them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>she should not give the church the responsibility of providing for the widows in her family</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>church:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>church</em> does not refer to a church building, but to all true believers. Together they form the assembly or community of God’s people. Avoid using a term that might suggest that Paul was referring to a building. Some ways to translate the term <em>church</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the assembly of God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the community of God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s family</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See also the notes on 3:5b and 3:15c.</p><h4>5:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that it can help the widows who are truly in need.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is so that the community of believers can help the widows who really need it.</p></li><li><p>Then the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> believers will be able to provide for those widows who have no one else to help them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that it can help the widows who are truly in need:</strong> This part of the verse tells the purpose for which Paul gave his command in the rest of 5:16. He wanted to ensure that the believers had enough resources to help the widows who had no family.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it:</strong> Here, the pronoun <em>it</em> refers to the church.

But it is highly unlikely that double honor means “double pay” (as cash), implying either twice as much as others who do not teach or twice as much as the widows. Rather it means “twofold honor,” the honor and respect due those in such positions as well as remuneration.”</span></span> When Paul talked about <em>double honor,</em> he was talking about two different ways in which believers should honor the elders. He did not mean that believers should give the elders twice the material rewards they gave other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>honor:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>honor</em> is closely related to the Greek word that the BSB translates as “honor” in 5:3. In 5:3, Paul was talking primarily about honoring widows by ensuring that they had the material things that they needed. In 5:18, Paul also talked about material help. The GNT shows this by translating <em>honor</em> as “pay.”</p><h4>5:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>especially those who have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">been given</span> the task of preaching and teaching.</p></li><li><p>particularly those who teach and who preach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s message</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>especially:</strong> The Greek word <em>malista</em> that the BSB translates as <em>especially</em> means “particularly,” “above all.” It seems to suggest that there were different kinds of elders among the Ephesian elders.

Paul was saying that believers should <em>especially</em> honor the elders who preached and taught.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>preaching:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>preaching</em> refers to announcing an important message.

It may be helpful in some languages to make this explicit. For example, the GW says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Reprimand those <u>leaders</u> who sin.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>those who…sin</em> is in the present tense. Paul may have used the present tense for one of two reasons:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>He was telling Timothy what he should do if an elder became guilty of a particular sin and did not repent of it, even if he only did it once. For example, the NJB says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>If anyone is at fault <em>(NJB, NIV, GNT, KJV, NET, GW, NLT, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul was telling Timothy what he should do if an elder was continuing to sin in a specific manner.

NASB: ‘those who continue in sin’; RSV, ‘those who persist in sin’). One implication would be that a person who is found to have sinned but is not at the moment engaged in the sin should not be dealt with as this verse indicates. Although the note of persistence may be intended by Paul, the more probable understanding is that the accusation is found to be true and the present tense is used to designate present <em>guilt</em> (GNT and NEB: ‘those who commit sins’). It is the committing of sin that is at issue.”</span></span> It does not seem from the context that Paul was talking about whether or not elders persist in sinning. Rather, he was talking about what believers should do when several people accuse an elder of some sin.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>should be rebuked in front of everyone:</strong> Paul was telling Timothy that he should confront the leader about his sin in front of all the other believers and tell him that he has sinned.</p><h4>5:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that the others will stand in fear of sin.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that other <span data-bnType=\"implied\">elders</span> will be afraid to sin.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> This Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> indicates the purpose for which Timothy should rebuke the elder publicly.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the others:</strong> This can refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>only the other elders (GW)</p></li><li><p>all the other believers (CEV)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions do not specify who <em>the others</em> are. However the most natural understanding of the context suggests that Paul was referring to the other elders. Therefore, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>will stand in fear of sin:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>will stand in fear of sin</em> literally means “may have fear.” If an elder was rebuked in front of other believers, he would be ashamed. When the other elders saw how ashamed the elder was, they would be afraid to sin. They would want to avoid the same shame.</p>",

He was implying that God, Jesus and even the angels would witness whether Timothy obeyed Paul or not.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul referred to Jesus as <em>Christ Jesus</em> instead of “Jesus Christ.” The names “Christ Jesus” and “Jesus Christ” refer to the same person.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some people, however, think that when Paul used the word <em>Christ</em> before the word <em>Jesus</em>, as in <em>Christ Jesus</em>, he was emphasizing that Jesus was the Messiah.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"2\">In most English versions “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated in the same order as they occur in the Greek manuscripts. It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that, in some languages, people may be confused to see the names in two different orders. They may even think that Paul was referring to two different people. If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the elect angels:</strong> Paul referred to the <em>angels</em> here by a word that the BSB translates as <em>elect.</em> This word indicates here that God had chosen the angels.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>angels:</strong> In this context, the word that the BSB translates as <em>angels</em> refers to “a supernatural, spiritual being who is a messenger from God.” See the note on 3:16d.</p><h4>5:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to maintain these principles without bias,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to do what I have instructed you to do without discriminating</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>maintain these principles:</strong> That is, follow or obey these instructions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>these principles:</strong> The phrase <em>these principles</em> refers to what Paul told Timothy to do in 5:19–20, which was to rebuke elders who had sinned.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Arichea and Hatton, page 130, say, “…verse 21 is better interpreted as looking back than forward. For one thing, the instructions that follow verse 21 seem to be less serious than the subject matter of the preceding verses. For another thing, verses 17–20 deal with one subject matter, whereas verses 22–25 deal with a combination of topics without any apparent unity.”</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without bias:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>without bias</em> means to do something without being biased for or against a person.

Some slaves who had become Christians seem to have started to disrespect or disobey their masters. Perhaps they felt that they should only obey God and that they no longer had to obey their masters. Paul told Timothy that he should teach slaves to respect their masters.</p></div><h4>6:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>All who are under the yoke of slavery</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Every <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believer</span> who is forced to be a slave</p></li><li><p>¶ All <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span> who are slaves</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>All who are under the yoke of slavery:</strong> That is, all slaves. But Paul was instructing believers in this letter, so here he was only speaking about slaves who were believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>under the yoke of slavery:</strong> The phrase <em>under the yoke of slavery</em> is a figure of speech. A <em>yoke</em> is a wooden frame that is usually very heavy. Normally it is placed over the necks of two animals to join them together, so that together they can pull something. The animals cannot free themselves from the yoke. Therefore, a yoke became a symbol of slavery.</p><h4>6:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>should regard their masters as fully worthy of honor,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>should treat his master as if he deserved the greatest respect,</p></li><li><p>should honor their masters in every way,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>should regard their masters as fully worthy of honor:</strong> Paul meant that a slave should have a respectful attitude toward the person who owned him. He should be obedient and work hard. His owner might be cruel and not really deserve respect, but Paul said that the slave should still treat him as if he did deserve respect. In Colossians 3:22 and Ephesians 6:5 Paul spoke in more detail about the way that a slave should respect his master.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>masters:</strong> The <em>masters</em> were the people who owned the slaves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fully worthy of honor:</strong> That is, fully deserve. The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>fully worthy of honor</em> literally means “all honor.” Paul used the word “all” to add emphasis and intensity. Slaves would give this honor primarily by obeying their masters.</p><h4>6:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that God’s name and our teaching will not be discredited.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that God’s name and our<sup>(incl)</sup> teaching may not be insulted.</p></li><li><p>so that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span> will not insult God and say that what we<sup>(incl)</sup> teach is untrue.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>so that</em> indicates that 6:1c is an important reason why slaves should treat their masters with respect.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God’s name:</strong> The expression that the BSB translates as <em>God’s name</em> does not refer to the name by which God was called. It refers to his character, and the kind of being he is. Many languages do not speak of someone’s name to refer to the person himself. Therefore, in some languages it may be necessary to translate <em>God’s name</em> here simply as “God.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>our teaching:</strong> When Paul mentioned <em>our teaching</em>, he was referring to the gospel. In other words, he was talking about what he taught about God and Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our:</strong> Here Paul was referring to himself, Timothy, and other leaders among the believers.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>discredited:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>discredited</em> here is often translated as “blasphemed.” It means to speak evil about someone or something. If believing slaves did not respect or obey their masters, then unbelievers would insult the gospel and God himself.</p>",

Some slaves might try to take advantage of such kindness and therefore <em>show</em> them <em>disrespect</em>. Paul wanted to make sure that that did not happen.</p><h4>6:2b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because they are brothers,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because they are brothers <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in Christ</span>.</p></li><li><p>because their <span data-bnType=\"implied\">masters</span> are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually</span> their brothers.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because they are brothers:</strong> There are two ways to understand this clause:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The word that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> introduces the reason that slaves might not respect their masters as they should. If both the slave and the master were believers, they were equal before Christ (Galatians 3:28). Therefore some slaves may have thought that they could treat their masters with less respect because they were equal. For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The slaves whose masters are believers should not show their masters any less respect because they are believers. <em>(BSB, NCV, NIV, RSV, NJB, NASB, REB, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The word that the BSB translates as <em>because</em> introduces the reason that slaves should not disrespect masters who were believers. They should respect them because they were also believers. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Slaves belonging to Christian masters must not despise them, for they are believers, too. <em>(GNT, CEV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Later in this verse, Paul added the information in interpretation (2).</p><h4>6:2c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but should serve them all the more,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, they should work even better/harder for them,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> introduces the contrast Paul was making. Paul expected believing slaves to respect their unbelieving masters (6:1). Here he was contrasting that with the way he expected them to respect believing masters. He expected them to respect them more.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>should serve them all the more:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>serve</em> means “work for,” “obey,” or “do the work of a slave.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all the more:</strong> Paul assumed that believing slaves knew that they needed to serve their unbelieving masters well. Here he said that believing slaves should serve their believing master even better than they would serve an unbelieving master.</p><h4>6:2d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>since those receiving their good service</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">masters</span> for whom they are working</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>since:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>since</em> indicates that 6:2d–e gives a reason that slaves should especially work hard for Christian masters.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>those receiving their good service:</strong> This refers to the masters for whom the slaves worked.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>their good service:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>good service</em> literally means “act of kindness.” The slave was acting kindly toward his Christian master by working for him and helping him in practical ways.</p><h4>6:2e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:2e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>are beloved believers.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">also</span> believers, and they love them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as brothers in Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>are beloved believers:</strong> If somebody is dear to a person, it means that the person loves him. The Greek text does not say who loved the masters. There are two interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The slaves loved the masters. For example, the NIV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>dear <u>to them</u> <em>(NIV, GNT, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>God or Christ loved the masters. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>he loves them</u> <em>(CEV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions are ambiguous. It is true that God and Christ loved the masters. However, it is more likely in this context that Paul was talking about love between believers. So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul was saying that if Christian slaves had Christian masters, they should show that they loved them by serving them well.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:2c–e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is necessary to state the reason for something before the conclusion.

They thought that teaching about God was merely an effective way to become rich.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Paragraph 6:6–10</strong>: People think that they need to be rich in order to be happy.

However, in this context the clause it introduces is not really a conditional clause. Paul <u>knew</u> there were people among the Ephesian believers who taught <em>another doctrine</em>. In some languages this can be made clearer by saying “Anyone who…” or “Whoever…”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>teaches another doctrine:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>teaches another doctrine</em> literally means “teaches what is different” or “teaches what is untrue.” The same phrase is used in 1:3d. Paul was warning Timothy against people who taught something different from what Paul himself taught. For example, the CEV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Anyone who teaches something different…</p></blockquote><h4>6:3b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:3b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and disagrees with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and does not agree with the correct teaching that our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ gave</p></li><li><p>and that are not consistent with the accurate things that our<sup>(incl)</sup> Lord Jesus Christ taught.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>disagrees:</strong> The false teachers taught things about Christ and his message that were different from what Christ and his apostles taught.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Paul told Timothy that the <em>sound words</em> were <u><em>of</em></u> <em>our Lord Jesus Christ</em>. Scholars have understood this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means “from our Lord Jesus Christ” and refers to what Christ taught, both when he was alive on earth and through his apostles.</p></li><li><p>It means “about our Lord Jesus Christ” and refers to the things that the apostles taught about Christ.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions say “the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ,” which is ambiguous. However, this phrase is most naturally understood as the words spoken by Christ. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the sound words:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>sound</em> literally means “healthy.” See the note on 1:10d, where the same Greek word is used. Paul was saying that these <em>words</em> were correct and without error.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>our:</strong> This again refers to Paul, Timothy, and the Ephesian believers.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> is a general word that means “master.” It was used to address any respected person. Here it refers to Christ. You could translate it as “owner” or “chief.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Jesus Christ:</strong> Notice that in this verse Paul used the more usual order <em>Jesus Christ</em> to refer to Jesus. It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><h4>6:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and with godly teaching,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and with instruction that honors God,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">They also do not</span> teach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things which</span> help people to behave as God wants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>godly teaching:</strong> When he used the words <em>godly teaching</em>, Paul was talking about the kind of teaching that helps people to behave as God wants them to behave.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>godly:</strong> See godliness, godly in the Glossary.</p>",

This Greek word also occurs in 2 Timothy 3:4.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>understands nothing:</strong> This is the second accusation that Paul made against the false teachers in this passage. Paul did not literally mean that the false teachers understood nothing at all. This is an example of hyperbole or exaggeration.

This is similar to what Paul said about them in 1:7b and 1:7c.</p><h4>6:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Instead, he has an unhealthy interest in controversies and semantics,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Such a</span> person is addicted to arguing and quarreling about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unimportant</span> issues and words.</p></li><li><p>They take an unhealthy enjoyment in debating with each other and arguing about what words mean.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>he has an unhealthy interest:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>has an unhealthy interest</em> literally means “has a sick desire.” Paul was saying that the false teachers were interested in controversies and quarrels about words. He was also saying that this was harming them spiritually.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>controversies and semantics:</strong> The two Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>controversies</em> and <em>semantics</em> have almost the same meaning.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moore, page 55, says this is a “near-synonymous doublet (borderline) (coordinate, with ‘and’).”</span></span> The false teachers liked to argue, dispute, debate, and disagree with other people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>semantics:</strong> The false teachers were arguing with other people about <em>semantics</em>. They were possibly arguing about what certain words in the Old Testament meant. Paul warned Timothy again in 2 Timothy 2:14 about how such quarrels could be harmful.</p><h4>6:4c–5a</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In these verse parts, Paul described the results of such unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words. He listed five results:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>envy (6:4c)</p></li><li><p>strife (6:4c)</p></li><li><p>abusive talk (6:4d)</p></li><li><p>evil suspicions (6:4d)</p></li><li><p>constant friction (6:5a)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">These five things were characteristics of the false teachers.

It makes him resentful and discontented with what he has and who he is.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your language may have an idiomatic way to talk about <em>envy</em>. If so, you could use it here.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida (88.160) on <em>phthonos</em></span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>strife:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>strife</em> refers to what happens when people quarrel and disagree with one other. In the New Testament this word almost always occurs along with a word that means “envy” or “jealousy.” See Romans 1:29, 13:13; 1 Corinthians 1:11, 3:3; 2 Corinthians 12:20; Galatians 5:20; Philippians 1:15; Titus 3:9. When people are envious of each other, this causes them to quarrel and disagree with each other.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul said in 6:4b that the false teachers were interested in controversies and quarrels. Here in 6:4c he said that this resulted in <em>strife</em> among believers. Use a stronger word to translate <em>strife</em> than you did to translate “controversies and quarrels” in 6:4b.</p><h4>6:4d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>abusive talk, evil suspicions,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>abusive speech, suspicious thinking,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> insult <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each other</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> suspect <span data-bnType=\"implied\">each other of</span> doing evil,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>abusive talk:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>abusive talk</em> refers to verbal abuse and insults. The false teachers and those who followed them spoke harshly and said slanderous things about people.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>evil suspicions:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>suspicions</em> refers to thoughts that somebody has done something wrong. If a person has <em>evil suspicions</em>, he may accuse other people of wrong doing without any proof.</p>",

He also told him that it was dangerous to want a lot of money. He told him that the false teachers were sinning in many ways, but that they were especially sinning by trying to use religion to get more money. He told believers to be content with what they had.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The paragraphs in this section are:</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Paragraph 6:3–5</strong>: The false teachers taught things about Christ and his message that were incorrect. They discussed unimportant issues that caused arguments. They did not understand how to distinguish between what was true and what was false. They thought that teaching about God was merely an effective way to become rich.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Paragraph 6:6–10</strong>: People think that they need to be rich in order to be happy.

The term that the BSB translates as <em>constant friction</em> refers to the unpleasant relationship between people who continually quarrel with each other over unimportant things. Here are some possible ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>There is no end to their arguments with people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All the time they squabble with each other</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>men of depraved mind:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>men of depraved mind</em> refers to the false teachers themselves.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The reason that the false teachers behaved the way they did was because their minds were depraved<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, pages 250–251, says, “The ultimate reason for all that precedes (from <em>τετύφωται</em> [=‘has been puffed up’; NIV = ‘conceited’] on) is given in two participles (<em>διεφθαρμένων</em> [=‘having been corrupted’] and <em>ἀπεστερημένων</em> [=‘having been deprived’], genitive to agree with <em>ἀνθρώπων</em> [=‘men’]), each followed by a noun indicating where or in what way the participle applies.” See also Knight, page 252.</span></span> and they were “devoid of the truth” (6:5b).</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>depraved mind:</strong> The Greek words that the BSB translates as <em>of depraved mind</em> refer to people whose minds can no longer discern the difference between right and wrong.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, page 252, says that the devil is in view here as the one who causes the corruption. He says that the devil is also the subject in 6:5c. However, it would probably be a mistake to translate this explicitly with the devil as the agent/subject, here. It would highlight the role of the devil too much, perhaps making it seem that the false teachers were not to blame. Paul himself does not highlight the devil here. He keeps the focus on the actual state of the false teachers. That is why we suggest translating it as a simple fact that their minds are corrupt, without stating that the devil causes the corruption.</span></span> The Greek text does not say who made these people’s minds depraved, and you should avoid trying to make that explicit in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>mind:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>mind</em> refers to a person’s “way of thinking,” or “thoughts.” You should use an expression in your language for the part of a person that “thinks.”</p><h4>6:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who are devoid of the truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and they can no longer understand what is true.</p></li><li><p>It is as if someone has stolen from them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the ability to understand</span> the truth.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>devoid of the truth:</strong> Paul did not say who had made the false teachers <em>devoid of the truth</em>. You also should avoid trying to make that explicit in your translation. Rather, Paul was emphasizing that the false teachers could no longer understand what was true.</p><h4>6:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>These men regard godliness as a means of gain.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They think that <span data-bnType=\"implied\">teaching</span> about God is a way to make money.</p></li><li><p>They think that if they teach about God they can become rich.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>These men regard:</strong> Here Paul talked about one of the lies that the false teachers thought was true.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>godliness as a means of gain:</strong> <span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some translations include the words “from such withdraw thyself” (KJV) at the end of this verse. However, most people who study the Greek texts agree that these words were not present in Paul’s original letter to Timothy. The Editorial Committee of the UBS New Testament (4 <sup>th</sup> edition) gives the reading without “from such withdraw thyself” an {A} rating, indicating that the text is almost certain. Metzger, page 643, says, “Although the reading is ancient, as appears from patristic testimony, it must be rejected as a pious but banal gloss, because (a) the best manuscripts of both the Alexandrian and the Western types of text…support the shorter reading, and (b) if it were present originally, no good reason can be assigned for its omission.”</span></span> The false teachers hoped that when they behaved in a godly manner, they would make lots of money. One way to express this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>godliness is a <span data-bnType=\"implied\">good</span> way to make a lot of money.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>godliness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godliness</em> normally refers to the way people behave when they respect God. Paul used the word <em>godliness</em> in this way in 2:2c, 3:16a, 4:7b and 4:8b. However, here in 6:5c, the context is different.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is most likely that <em>godliness</em> here refers to teaching about God. The false teachers wanted to teach about God so that they could become rich by charging money for people to listen to them. In Paul’s time, people often gained money by going from town to town teaching different religions. That is what the false teachers in Ephesus were also trying to do. They were trying to become rich by teaching about God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Kelly, page 135, says, “It has been disputed whether the charge is that they used their show of piety as a lever for material advancement, or that they exacted fees for the esoteric religious instruction they gave to their adherents. The latter is almost certainly correct, for it coheres better with what follows, and also (if we are justified in regarding it as a parallel) with the picture of their strenuous propagandist methods given in Tit. i. ii. Further, it is inconceivable that the profession of Christianity was materially advantageous at any of the times which have been seriously proposed for the composition of the Pastorals. As we have seen (v. 17 f.: cf. 2 Tim. ii. 6), Paul has no objection to church officials, least of all teachers, receiving emoluments. His complaint against the sectaries seems to be that they make money their prime objective and set a specific price upon their wares.”</span></span></p>",

He also told him that it was dangerous to want a lot of money. He told him that the false teachers were sinning in many ways, but that they were especially sinning by trying to use religion to get more money. He told believers to be content with what they had.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">The paragraphs in this section are:</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Paragraph 6:3–5</strong>: The false teachers taught things about Christ and his message that were incorrect. They discussed unimportant issues that caused arguments. They did not understand how to distinguish between what was true and what was false. They thought that teaching about God was merely an effective way to become rich.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Paragraph 6:6–10</strong>: People think that they need to be rich in order to be happy. But the truth is that a person is happy only when he obeys God.</p></div><h4>6:9a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Those who want to be rich, however,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Some</span> people want to become rich <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so much that</span></p></li><li><p>People who <span data-bnType=\"implied\">really</span> want to have lots of money</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Those who want to be rich:</strong> When Paul referred to <em>Those who want to be rich</em>, he was referring to people, like the false teachers, who wanted to be rich more than they wanted to follow God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>however:</strong> The Greek particle <em>de</em> connects 6:8 and 6:9. In this context, this particle indicates that there is a contrast between these two verses. The contrast is between those who are content (6:8) and those who want to become rich (6:9). The BSB translates this with the word <em>however</em>. If in your language you have a way to show this contrast, you should use it to connect these verses.</p><h4>6:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>fall into temptation and become ensnared</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>they let themselves give in to whatever tempts them.

It means to give in to temptation, that is, when a person is tempted to do something wrong, they choose to do the wrong thing and so sin.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>become ensnared:</strong> This is another figure of speech. Paul had used the metaphor of a snare already, in 3:7c. He also used it in 2 Timothy 2:26. The desire to be rich is like a snare or trap that catches an animal. The person caught in such a trap cannot get free by himself.</p><h4>6:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>by many foolish and harmful desires</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>They want to do things which are unwise and dangerous for them <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and other people</span>.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">their own</span> silly and dangerous desires will conquer them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>many foolish and harmful desires:</strong> There are two ways to understand this phrase:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This is a third trap into which the people who want to become rich fall. <em>(NIV, RSV, KJV, NASB, REB, NET)</em></p></li><li><p>This is what the trap mentioned in 6:9b consists of. For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the trap of many foolish and harmful desires <em>(BSB, GNT, NJB, CEV, GW, NRSV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foolish…desires:</strong> People who want to become rich also have many <em>foolish…desires</em>, that is, they start to want things that are wrong, unwise, and sinful. This is what happens to people when they want to become rich more than they want to follow God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>harmful desires:</strong> The <em>desires</em> that these people have are not only <em>foolish</em>, but also <em>harmful</em>. They want to do things that could hurt or damage themselves or other people.</p><h4>6:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that plunge them into ruin and destruction.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>These desires will cause them to be ruined and destroyed.</p></li><li><p>As a result, they will suffer greatly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that plunge them into ruin and destruction:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>plunge</em> means to push someone or something under water. Paul was using a figure of speech here. He meant that the desires of 6:9c often cause overwhelming ruin and destruction. In some languages, it may be necessary to remove the figure of speech and translate only the meaning. One way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that cause people to be ruined and destroyed</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>ruin and destruction:</strong> Scholars interpret these two words in different ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They say that both words refer to suffering on this earth.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Moore, page 55, classifies this as a synonymous doublet.</span></span></p></li><li><p>They say that <em>ruin</em> refers to suffering before death and <em>destruction</em> refers to suffering after death, in hell.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, pages 256–257, says, “…because <em>ὄλεθρος</em> [=‘ruin’] is used in 1 Cor. 5:5 of ‘destruction of the flesh’ here and now, with the hope ‘that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,’ i.e., for eternity, it has been suggested that <em>ὄλεθρος</em> refers here also to bodily destruction and <em>ἀπώλεια</em> [=‘destruction’] to spiritual destruction (van Oosterzee, Kelly [possible], Spicq, Dornier), or that <em>ὄλεθρος</em> refers here to present destruction and <em>ἀπώλεια</em> to destruction (perdition) in eternity (so Vine, <em>Expository Dictionary</em>, I, 304; NEB: ‘ruin and perdition’; Robertson: ‘destruction and perdition’). Either or both of these suggestions that see a contrast between the two terms point to the most likely solution (which is not to say that <em>ὄλεθρος</em> cannot refer to eternity: it clearly does in 2 Thes. 1:9; cf. 1 Thes. 5:3).”</span></span></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Either interpretation is possible and it is recommended that you translate them in as general a way as possible.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">These two words translated <em>ruin</em> and <em>destruction</em> mean almost the same thing. In some languages it may be necessary to combine these two terms into one expression. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>absolute ruin</p></blockquote>",

He told him that the false teachers were sinning in many ways, but that they were especially sinning by trying to use religion to get more money.

In other words, it gives the reason that those who want to become rich incur the problems listed in 6:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here, Paul used a proverb to give the reason for 6:9.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, page 257, reports that a “widely attested” ancient Greek proverb says “The love of money is the mother-city of all evil.” Paul modifies the proverb, but still keeps it in proverb form.</span></span></p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the love of money:</strong> In some languages, it is not possible to <em>love</em> an object like <em>money</em>. If this is true in your language, it may be possible to say something like “wanting money,” or “wanting to become rich.” Or it may be possible to use a word like “greed.” See the note on 3:3d.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the root of all kinds of evil:</strong> To say that “the love of money” is the <u><em>root </em></u>of all kinds of evil is a figure of speech. It means that it <u>causes</u> much evil. For example, when people want to become rich, they may easily become selfish. They may cheat, lie, steal, envy, or quarrel. They may hate people, hurt them, and even kill them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is not clear from the Greek grammar here whether the word that the BSB translates as <em>the root</em> should be translated as:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u><em>a</em></u> <em>root</em>, that is, one source or cause of evil among many possible sources or causes. <em>(NIV, GNT, NASB, NRSV, CEV, NCV, NLT)</em></p></li><li><p>“<u>the</u> root,” that is, the only source or cause of evil. <em>(BSB, RSV, NJB, KJV, REB, NET, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The Greek text is ambiguous. However, Paul was probably implying that there were other causes of evil as well as the love of money. So it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>all kinds of evil:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>all kinds of evil</em> can be understood in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>all</u> <u>sorts</u> or <u>kinds</u> of evil. In other words, the love of money can result in different sorts of evil behavior. <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NRSV, NASB, GW, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>It means <u>all</u> evil. In other words, the love of money is the cause of every evil behavior. <em>(RSV, NJB, KJV, REB, NET)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><h4>6:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>By craving it, some have wandered away from the faith</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Some people have gradually stopped believing the teachings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span> because they wanted money <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so much</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>By craving it, some have wandered away from the faith:</strong> Paul knew that some people in Ephesus had <em>wandered from the faith</em> <u>because</u> they were <em>eager for money</em>. It is possible that he was referring to the false teachers. These teachers thought that godliness was a means to financial gain (6:5c). Paul may also have been referring to those who had been influenced by them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wandered away from the faith:</strong> The form of the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>wandered away from</em> literally means “have been led astray.” Here Paul used the Greek verb figuratively, It refers to a person who has allowed money to hinder him from following Christian teaching. See the note on 1:6a and 6:21b.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the faith:</strong> When Paul referred to <u><em>the</em></u> <em>faith</em>, he was referring to the true teachings about God and about Christ. See the note on “the faith” in 3:9. See faith, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>6:10c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:10c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and pierced themselves with many sorrows.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they</span> suffer in many ways, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like a person who has</span> stabbed himself.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">they have</span> caused themselves to suffer in many ways.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and:</strong> This part of the verse gives the second thing that happens when people are “crave” money.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pierced themselves with many sorrows:</strong> Paul was using a figure of speech here to help the believers understand his point. People suffer physically if they <em>pierce</em> or stab themselves. In the same way, people who are eager for money often suffer terribly. For example, some people work so hard to become rich that they lose friends.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to make the comparison explicit. For example, one way to do this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>[they have] <span data-bnType=\"implied\">caused themselves</span> to suffer as greatly <span data-bnType=\"implied\">as if they had</span> pierced themselves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with a weapon</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have no suitable figure of speech in your language, you can translate only the meaning. For example, the NCV says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>they have caused themselves much sorrow</p></blockquote>",

He gave him four main instructions:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>to “pursue…perseverance” (6:11c, 6:11e)</p></li><li><p>to “fight the good fight of the faith” (6:12a)</p></li><li><p>to “take hold of…eternal life” (6:12b)</p></li><li><p>to “keep this commandment…until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ” (6:14a, 6:14c)</p></li></ol></div><h4>6:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But you, O man of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Timothy</span>, since you belong to God,</p></li><li><p>¶ However, you have devoted yourself to God.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>But you:</strong> Paul began this verse with an emphatic pronoun <em>you</em><sup>(sing)</sup> along with the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>But</em>. He used these words to introduce a contrast. He had described those who wanted to become rich and therefore eventually wandered from the faith (6:3–10). Now he described the way that Timothy should behave (6:11–16).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>O man of God:</strong> Paul called Timothy <em>man of God</em>. There are two ways to understand this:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul meant that Timothy was a Christian and that he was someone who belonged to God and desired to behave as God wanted him to behave. For example, the NET says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a person dedicated to God <em>(NET, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul was using the words <em>man of God</em> in a special sense to say that Timothy was like a prophet. This is what the expression <em>man of God</em> meant in the Old Testament. For example, Moses (Deuteronomy 33:1), Samuel (1 Samuel 9), Elijah (1 Kings 17:18) and others were called by this title.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Most English versions translate this phrase literally. If you wish to follow one of the above interpretations in your translation, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). Paul called Timothy <em>man of God</em> to highlight that he was commanding Timothy to behave in a way that showed that he belonged to God. This expression is used in 2 Timothy 3:17 as a general term for a believer.</p><h4>6:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>flee from these things</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>you must avoid all that.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">That is why</span> you must stay away from all such behavior.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>flee:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>flee</em> literally means “to run away from.” But here Paul used it in a figurative way to mean “avoid” or “stay away from.” People “avoid” or <em>flee</em> from danger. In the same way, Paul wanted Timothy to avoid behaving in the ways mentioned in 6:3–10.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>these things:</strong> Paul was talking about the issues that he had discussed in the previous verses: all the ways in which people might sin when they want to become rich.</p><h4>6:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and pursue righteousness, godliness,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Make every effort to do only what is right. Behave as God wants you to behave.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>pursue righteousness, godliness:</strong> This is also a figure of speech. In some languages a verb like <em>pursue</em> can only be used with an animate object like a person or an animal. It is not possible to <em>pursue</em> something like <em>righteousness</em> or the other qualities in this list (6:11c–e). People use all their physical energy when they chase after someone or something. Paul meant that Timothy should use all his effort to behave in these ways.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> This is the first of six qualities that Paul told Timothy to pursue. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> refers to doing things that God considers right.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>godliness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>godliness</em> refers to the way people behave when they respect God. See godliness, godly in the Glossary.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Louw and Nida define <em>righteousness</em> (88.13) as “the act of doing what God requires” and define <em>godliness</em> (53.5) as “behavior reflecting correct religious beliefs and attitudes.” They recommend translating the word “godliness” in 1 Timothy 2:2 as “to live as God would have us live” or “to live as God has told us we should live.” So, you can see how similar the two words are.</span></span></p><h4>6:11d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>faith, love,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Trust <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span>. Love <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>faith:</strong> See faith, meaning 1, in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love:</strong> In this verse, Paul was probably talking about love for other people rather than love for God.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, page 262, says, “Where, however, Paul indicates or implies the object of love, it is most often human beings (e.g., Rom. 12:9; 13:10; 14:15; 2 Cor. 8:7; Gal. 5:13; Eph. 1:15; 4:2; Col. 1:4; 2:2; 1 Thes. 3:12; 5:13; 2 Thes. 1:3; Phm. 5, 7). Humans seem to be the object in 1 Corinthians 13, which is followed by words similar to those here, i.e., <em>διώκετε τὴν ἀγάπην</em> [=‘pursue love’] (1 Cor. 14:1). Thus if a specific object is intended here, and it need not be, it would probably be humans.”</span></span></p><h4>6:11e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>perseverance, and gentleness.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Never give up <span data-bnType=\"implied\">obeying God</span>. Do not become angry with people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>perseverance:</strong> When Paul said that Timothy should pursue <em>perseverance</em>, he meant that Timothy should persist in trusting God and in doing what pleased God, no matter what happened.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>gentleness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>gentleness</em> refers to not being harsh or rough with other people. In the New Testament it usually refers to the way in which a person talks to other people. It can also include the way that a person treats other people.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The actual word which Paul uses here, <em>praupathia</em>, does not occur anywhere else in the New Testament. However, its synonym <em>prautēs</em> occurs eight times, in 1 Corinthians 4:21; 2 Corinthians 10:1; Galatians 5:23, 6:1; Ephesians 4:2; Colossians 3:12; 2 Timothy 2:25; and Titus 3:2.</span></span></p>",

This is easiest if your verb “fight” includes different sorts of fighting.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>In John 18:36 the word is rendered “fight”; in 1 Thessalonians 2:2 it is rendered “strong opposition.”</span></span> <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, KJV, NASB, NJB, GW, NLT, CEV, NCV)</em></p></li><li><p>To use a verb that means “compete” as an athlete does in a sports competition.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>1 Corinthians 9:25; Hebrews 12:1</span></span> For example, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Run your best in the race of faith, and win eternal life for yourself… <em>(GNT, REB, NET)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as the majority of English versions have done.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used this figure of speech in 2 Timothy 4:7. You should use the same translation in both these passages.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the good fight of the faith:</strong> A believer who behaves in the way God wants will encounter difficulties and opposition. The Greek expression that the BSB translates as <em>the good fight of the faith</em> refers to the believer’s struggle against that opposition.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the faith:</strong> See faith, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>6:12b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Take hold of the eternal life</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Claim the life <span data-bnType=\"implied\">with God</span> that lasts forever,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Take hold of the eternal life:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Take hold of</em> literally means “catch” or “grasp firmly.” Paul used this verb figuratively here. He was telling Timothy to claim the eternal life that God had already given him and not to let go of it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal life:</strong> The expression that the BSB translates as <em>eternal life</em> means life that never ends. As the note on 1:16d said, a believer’s eternal life begins when he believes in Christ and continues after he dies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is likely that Paul was referring to the fact that Timothy’s eternal life had already begun. Therefore, Paul was exhorting Timothy to experience the benefits of eternal life now.</p><h4>6:12c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:12c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to which you were called</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> called you,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called:</strong> The verb that the BSB translates as <em>called</em> in this context means that Timothy was chosen [to receive eternal life (6:12b)].

However, be sure that you keep the main focus of the verses.</p><h4>6:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I charge you</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I command you</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">With these two as witnesses,</span> I order you</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I charge you:</strong> That is, Paul was ordering Timothy to do something.

Paul was stressing that what he would say next was extremely important. See also the note on “before God” in 5:21a.</p><h4>6:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who gives life to all things,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> who causes everything to live,</p></li><li><p>It is he who gives life to everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that lives</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who gives life to all things:</strong> This verse part gives a description of God.

It is recommended that you do the same thing.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">However, it is possible that, in some languages, people may be confused to see the names in two different orders. They may even think that Paul was referring to two different people. If this is true in your language, it may be necessary to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> as “Jesus Christ.” This is the more usual word order in the New Testament.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Christ:</strong> The word <em>Christ</em> is used two ways in the New Testament. In the Gospels, <em>Christ</em> is a title for Jesus. It means “the anointed one.” But later, by the time that Paul and others wrote letters to individuals and churches, the word <em>Christ</em> was used as another name for Jesus. It was no longer used as a title. So here and in other New Testament letters you should spell <em>Christ</em> according to the rules of your language.</p><h4>6:13e</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13e\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who made the good confession in His testimony before Pontius Pilate:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Jesus who spoke the truth when Pontius Pilate <span data-bnType=\"implied\">questioned him</span>;</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Remember that</span> Jesus told the truth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about himself</span> to Pontius Pilate.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>who made the good confession in His testimony before Pontius Pilate:</strong> This clause describes Jesus’ action when he testified before Pilate.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the good confession:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the good confession</em> probably refers to what Jesus told Pilate. Jesus told the truth about himself. For example, Jesus knew that his enemies would kill him if he said that he was the king of the Jews. Even though he knew that, he answered “yes” when Pilate asked him that question. See Matthew 27:11; Mark 15:2; Luke 23:3; John 18:33–37.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His testimony:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>testimony</em> refers here to giving evidence in a court.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>before Pontius Pilate:</strong> That is, Jesus testified while standing in front of <em>Pontius Pilate</em> to be judged.</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>Pontius Pilate:</strong> <em>Pontius Pilate</em> was the Roman governor of Judea at the time when Jesus was crucified.

Scholars suggest many different things to which Paul might have been referring. Three of the suggestions are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was referring to everything that God expected Timothy to do as a believer and as a minister of the gospel. For example, the NLT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>obey his [God’s] commands <em>(NLT, GNT, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Paul was referring to everything that he had commanded Timothy to do in this letter.</p></li><li><p>Paul was referring to what he had commanded Timothy to do immediately before this, in 6:11–12. Translations that supply the word <em>this</em> and use a singular “command” are probably following this interpretation. <em>(BSB, NIV, KJV, GW)</em></p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some English versions are ambiguous. The same Greek phrase occurs in a similar context in 2 Peter 2:21 and 3:2. Also Paul did not use a word meaning <em>this</em>. Therefore, interpretation (1) is probably correct, and it is recommended that you follow it.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Knight, pages 266–267 says, “Each option has a certain plausibility to it within this context alone. Hence consideration must be given to use of <em>ἐντολή</em> [=‘command’] elsewhere in contexts analogous to this one and to use of analogous terms in 1 Timothy. Paul does not use singular articular <em>ἡ ἐντολή</em> frequently; when he does, he refers to one of the Ten Commandments (Rom. 7:8–13), which seems unlikely here. In the non-Pauline NT letters <em>ἡ ἐντολή</em> is used in 2 Pet. 2:21; 3:2 (and in 1 John and 2 John of the love command, but that meaning has not been suggested here and nothing in 1 Timothy 6 would seem to warrant it). In 2 Peter <em>ἡ ἐντολή</em> is used ‘as a description of Christianity considered as a body of ethical teaching’ (Bauckham, <em>Jude, 2 Peter</em>, at 2:21; at 3:2 he indicates that the term is used ‘in the same way’). Such a meaning for <em>ἡ ἐντολή</em> in 1 Tim. 6:14 would seem to be supported by the significance of analogous terms in the PE [=Pastoral Epistles]: Paul has designated the Christian faith as ‘the command’ (<em>ἡ παραγγελία</em>, 1 Tim. 1:5), and in the conclusion of the letter (6:20) he charges Timothy to ‘guard the deposit,’ i.e., the Christian faith (<em>τὴν παραθήκην φύλαξον</em>). In 2 Tim. 4:7 he uses the same verb as he does here in saying that he himself has ‘kept the faith’ (<em>τὴν πίστιν τετήρηκα</em>). Paul speaks, therefore, about the Christian faith as a command and as that which must be guarded or kept. This formulation of the matter was already presented by Jesus in the Great Commission, which in its Greek form (Mt. 28:20) contains the same verb, <em>τηρέω</em>, as 1 Tim. 6:14 and the verb <em>ἐντέλλω</em>, which is the cognate of <em>ἐντολή</em>.” On pages 267–268, Knight continues, saying, “The other…alternatives…refer ‘the commandment’ to vv. 11–12 or to the whole letter and would seem to require that the text read ‘this,’ rather than ‘the,’ commandment. They also seem not to give adequate attention to the definiteness and absoluteness of the phrase ‘<em>the</em> commandment.’”</span></span></p><h4>6:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>without stain or reproach</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>without fault or failure</p></li><li><p>completely <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so that no one can</span> accuse <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you of doing wrong</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without stain:</strong> This is a figure of speech.

He gave him four main instructions:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>to “pursue…perseverance” (6:11c, 6:11e)</p></li><li><p>to “fight the good fight of the faith” (6:12a)</p></li><li><p>to “take hold of…eternal life” (6:12b)</p></li><li><p>to “keep this commandment…until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ” (6:14a, 6:14c)</p></li></ol></div><h4>6:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He alone is immortal</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he is the only one who lives forever</p></li><li><p>Only he will never die.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He alone is immortal:</strong> To say that only God is <em>immortal</em> is to say that he is the only one who lives forever and never dies.</p><h4>6:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and dwells in unapproachable light.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and who is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">surrounded</span> by light <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so bright</span> that no one can approach it.</p></li><li><p>He lives in light <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so bright</span> that no one can come near to it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and dwells in unapproachable light:</strong> In the Old Testament, God often demonstrated his presence by appearing as a bright light. This is part of the meaning of God’s “glory.” Paul was probably thinking about this aspect of God’s presence when he wrote that God <em>dwells in unapproachable light</em>. Even Moses was not able to approach the tabernacle when God’s glory (<em>light</em>) filled it (Exodus 40:34–35).</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>unapproachable:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>unapproachable</em> means that no one can approach or come near this “light.”</p><h4>6:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>No one has ever seen Him, nor can anyone see Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>No person <span data-bnType=\"implied\">while alive</span> has ever seen him, nor is anyone able to see him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Him:</strong> This refers to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>nor can anyone see Him:</strong> Not only has no person seen God, but it is not possible for a person to see God and remain alive (Exodus 33:20).</p><h4>6:16d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:16d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People</span> will honor God, and he will always be mighty. Amen.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To Him be honor and eternal dominion:</strong> Paul was not praying for God to receive honor and might. Instead, he was praising God because it is right to honor God, and God is mighty. The CEV expresses this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God will be honored, and his power will last forever.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>honor:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to use a verb rather than a noun like <em>honor</em>. To honor someone means to respect him and to treat him as an important person. See the note on 1:17d.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>eternal dominion:</strong> In Greek the expression that the BSB translates as <em>eternal</em> means that God will <u>always</u> deserve honor and might.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Amen:</strong> When people in the Bible prayed to God, they often ended by saying <em>Amen</em>. This means not only that they had finished, but that they fully agreed with what they had said. Because this word is well known even today, many translations just transliterate it. Another possibility is to translate it with an expression like “so let it be.” See the note on 1:17d.</p>",

However Paul told Timothy to remind them that they should not trust in money like this.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the uncertainty of wealth:</strong> Here Paul stated one reason that rich people should not trust in money to solve all their problems. The reason is that riches are <u>uncertain</u>. That is, people can lose their riches very suddenly—perhaps a thief may steal the money.</p><h4>6:17c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:17c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but in God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Tell them to depend instead upon God <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to provide for them</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but in God:</strong> Instead of depending on money, rich people (as well as everyone else) should depend on God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to say what people should hope in God for. If that is true in your language, you should say something general such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but they should depend on God for everything they need</p></blockquote><h4>6:17d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:17d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>who richly provides all things for us to enjoy.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He is the one</span> who generously gives us<sup>(incl)</sup> all things <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that we</span><sup>(incl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">have</span> so that we<sup>(incl)</sup> can enjoy them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>richly:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>richly</em> is related to the Greek word translated “wealth” in 6:17b. In this context this word means “generously” or “abundantly.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for us to enjoy:</strong> Here Paul stated the reason that God provides things for believers. He wants them to enjoy what he gives them, that is, he wants them to be happy with what he has given them and thank him for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>us:</strong> This again refers to Paul, Timothy, and the Ephesian believers.</p>",

Paul wanted the rich believers not only to do good (6:18a) but to do so “richly.” That is, he wanted them to do <u>many</u> good deeds.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>rich:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>rich</em> literally means “wealthy.” It was used in this literal way in 6:17a. Here the word is used figuratively (as in 6:17e) to mean “generous,” or “abundant.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In both Greek and English the word <em>rich</em> can have both this literal and figurative meaning.

This will happen for rich people if they will obey Paul’s command in 6:17–18.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>a firm foundation:</strong> Paul described this treasure as <em>a firm foundation</em>. A <em>foundation</em> is the base on which a house is built so that it will be stable. A foundation is the most stable part of a building. See the note on <em>foundation</em> in 3:15d. The stability of a foundation contrasts with what Paul said about riches on this earth, which easily disappear (6:17b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was saying here that when a rich person does good deeds, it is like that person is storing treasure. These good deeds act as a strong foundation upon which the person could build or base the future.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Jesus used a similar figure of speech in Matthew 6:20; Luke 12:33, 18:22.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the future:</strong> In this context, Paul was referring to the life that a believer would enjoy forever after death.

Living a life <em>which is truly life</em> means living life fully. This is something that a believer can only do in heaven with God. Life with God is true, real life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>take hold of:</strong> Paul was saying that when a person uses his possessions to help others, he can begin to experience eternal life. Paul was not saying that people earn their salvation by helping others. See the note on 6:12b.</p>",

In Greek and in English, it is natural to place this name at the beginning of the sentence. However, in other languages, it may be more natural to place it at the end or in the middle. You should place Timothy’s name where it is most natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>guard what has been entrusted to you:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>guard what has been entrusted to you</em> is a command to care for someone else’s possessions and make sure they are safe.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here, Paul was not talking about an object that Timothy was to guard. He was talking about a task that God had entrusted to Timothy. This was probably the task of teaching God’s message. God had given this responsibility to Timothy.

He was telling Timothy to avoid certain types of conversation. In other words, he was not to listen to such ideas and he was to make sure that they did not influence what he taught.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>irreverent:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>irreverent</em> here and in 4:7a was translated as “profane” in 1:9e.

Scholars understand this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Paul was referring to ideas that <u>opposed</u>, or contradicted, the true teaching about God.</p></li><li><p>Paul was referring to false teaching that contradicted itself and so was inconsistent and foolish.

It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so-called “knowledge”:</strong> Paul wanted Timothy to know the difference between true knowledge and what some people claimed to be <em>knowledge</em>. That is, the false teachers claimed that the false teaching was true. Paul made it clear here to Timothy that these <em>opposing arguments</em> were not real <em>knowledge</em>.</p>",

These people had been members of the Christian community but were no longer members.</p><h4>6:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and thus swerved away from the faith.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and by doing so, they no longer believe/follow the true teachings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and thus:</strong> That is, in accepting the false teaching.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>swerved away from the faith:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>swerved away from</em> originally meant “to miss the mark.” Later it came to mean “to miss, fail, deviate, and depart.” Here it is figurative language. It means that the believers who had accepted the false teaching had stopped following their faith. See the notes on 1:6a and 6:10b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the faith:</strong> See faith, meaning 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>6:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Grace be with you all.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ May God bless you<sup>(plur)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Grace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Grace</em> means “favor, good will, kindness.” Paul wanted God to show kindness and favor to Timothy. See Grace, meaning 1, in the Glossary. The same Greek word occurs in 1:2c with the same meaning. Try to use the same term here as you used in 1:2c.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you all:</strong> This is the one place in the letter where the word <em>you</em> in Greek is plural. Paul may have meant for more people than Timothy to read the letter, or he expected Timothy to pass on his greetings to the other believers.</p>",
