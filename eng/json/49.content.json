He gave his name first: “Paul.” Then he identified the people receiving the letter: “the saints in Ephesus.” Next, he gave a Christian greeting in 1:2.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings from Paul (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Greetings to the church at Ephesus</p></blockquote></div><h4>1:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Paul,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul,</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span>.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me,</span> Paul.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Paul:</strong> The BSB follows the Greek text by beginning this letter with the name of the person who wrote it. In some languages it will be clearer to use a sentence here. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This letter is from Paul (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be natural to use a word or form to indicate that Paul himself was addressing the believers. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I,</span> Paul, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">am writing this letter</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is from me</span> , Paul.</p></blockquote><h4>1:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">am</span> an apostle of Christ Jesus because of God’s will.</p></li><li><p>God chose me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am</span> a sent-one/messenger of Christ Jesus because that is what God wanted.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>an apostle of Christ Jesus:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>apostle</em> is literally “sent one.” It refers to a person whom someone sends with his authority to accomplish a mission or a particular purpose. Here, the word <em>apostle</em> refers to Paul whom Jesus chose and to whom he gave authority. After Jesus returned to heaven, his apostles were the leaders of those who believed in him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate <em>apostle</em> include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>representative <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>(special) messenger <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>sent-person <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Jesus Christ</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If you have already translated the Gospels, you can probably use the same term for apostle as you used there. In some languages you may need to change it slightly for this context. See apostle in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Christ Jesus:</strong> Notice that the word <em>Christ</em> comes before <em>Jesus</em>. The names Christ Jesus and Jesus Christ mean the same thing. In most English translations and other national language translations, “Jesus Christ” and “Christ Jesus” are translated literally, in the same order as they are in the Greek.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If the people who read your translation will be confused by the different order of the names, you may decide to translate <em>Christ Jesus</em> by the more familiar order: “Jesus Christ.” You should talk to many people about this matter and test it with many readers before you decide which order to use. In the Display the names “Christ Jesus,” “Jesus Christ,” and all other names, are translated literally and spelled according to normal English spelling. See Christ in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the will of God:</strong> The phrase <em>by the will of God</em> means that “God wanted Paul to be an apostle.” Paul himself did not decide to become an apostle.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate <em>by the will of God</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God chose Paul</p></blockquote><h4>1:1c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:1c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>To the saints in Ephesus,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I am writing to you</span><sup>(plur)</sup>, God’s people in Ephesus,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This letter is written</span> to the people belonging to God in Ephesus.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>To the saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> means “people set apart for God.” It does not refer to a special group of “holy people.” All Christians are <em>saints</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s holy people (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people belonging to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See Holy, Meaning 1, special use, in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Ephesus:</strong> There is an issue with the Greek text here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Some Greek manuscripts contain the words <em>in Ephesus</em>.

It means “to be united with Christ.” The BSB always translates it literally, but the GNT usually translates it as “in union with Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here it has the usual meaning of “in union with Christ Jesus” or “to be related to Christ by faith.” In many languages, it is difficult to translate this in a way that is clear and meaningful.

Here Paul used these words as a prayer to wish God’s blessing on the Ephesians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek, <em>Grace and peace to you</em> contains no verbs. In many languages, it may be more natural to add one or two verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ <u>give</u> you grace and peace. (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ <u>show</u> you grace and <u>give</u> you peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in your hearts</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In other languages, it may be better to translate <em>Grace</em> and <em>peace</em> as verbs, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray that</span> God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will <u>graciously help/bless</u> you and <u>help you to live well</u>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Grace:</strong> <em>Grace</em> here means that “God favors people” or that “he is kind to people even though they do not deserve it.” Paul used the word <em>Grace</em> to express his desire for God’s blessing on people and to wish them well. See grace, Meaning 1, in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s favor</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s gracious help</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s generous help</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>peace</em> refers to serenity and calm well-being. It often implies an absence of war or conflict. In the context of this Christian greeting, it probably implies the peace that comes from God for those who are in a relationship with him. Remember that the word <em>peace</em> has more than one meaning in the NT. You may need to translate it in different ways in different verses, according to the context.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tranquility</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>untroubled relationships</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>calm life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Since the pronoun <em>our</em> occurs with <em>Father</em>, consider whether it is more natural in your language to also say “our Lord” rather than “the Lord.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.

In such contexts, the word “bless” means “praise.” It indicates that people should praise God by telling others how wonderful and excellent he is.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In the Greek text there is no verb (be) after the word “blessed.” See the note on “blessed” in 1:3b below for more information.

Scholars have various views about the way in which this Greek word connects 1:3 and 1:4. Here are the three main interpretations:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The Greek word introduces some of the <u>specific</u> blessings that God has given us. In 1:3, Paul made the general statement that God has blessed us with every blessing. Beginning with 1:4, he tells specifically what some of these blessings are. An example of this interpretation is the NCV, which says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>3b</sup>God has given us every spiritual blessing…. <sup>4</sup><u>That is</u>, in Christ, he chose us before the world was made…. (NCV) <em>(NCV, NJB footnote)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek word indicates the <u>reason</u> that God blessed us. All the blessings in 1:3 come to us because God chose us before he made the world. So according to this interpretation, the Greek word should be translated as “for” or “because.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>For</u> he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world… (NET) <em>(BSB, NIV, NET, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The Greek word indicates that the <u>manner</u> in which God has blessed us is the same as the manner in which he chose us. God has blessed us in Christ just as he chose us in Christ. According to this interpretation, the Greek word should be translated as “just as” or “even as.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…<u>just as</u> He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world… (NASB) <em>(RSV, KJV, NASB, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate following interpretation (1):</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate the Greek word with a word or a phrase to explicitly show the connection between 1:3 and 1:4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>specifically</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that is (NCV)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Do not translate the Greek word and leave the connection implicit.</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">The Display gives an example of each.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He chose us in Him:</strong> The pronoun <em>He</em> refers to God.

He chose the Jews to be the first to believe in Christ, so that they should bring him praise.

This same expression occurs in 1:7a. You may be able to translate it in the same way.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we were also chosen:</strong> Here Paul used the pronoun <em>we</em> to refer to himself and other Jewish believers. Since the Ephesians were Gentiles, the pronoun <em>we</em> does not refer to the Ephesians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>also:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>also</em> is used to emphasize God’s action of choosing Paul and his fellow Jews through Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>chosen:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>chosen</em> occurs only here in the New Testament. It is a passive verb. This verb includes the idea of casting lots either:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>to determine who is appointed to a certain role,</p></li><li><p>to determine who obtains a portion of something such as an inheritance. There are several ways to interpret this verb:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means that the Jews were <u>appointed to be God’s inheritance</u>. As such, the verb basically means “chosen.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God chose us to be his own people (GNT) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, GW, CEV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means that the Jews were <u>chosen to obtain/receive an inheritance</u>, i.e. salvation.

In some languages it may be necessary to make it an active verb by stating who did the predestinating. God predestined us long before.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this verb:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> determined long ago <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to do this for us</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This was <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s</span> decision <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for us</span> from ages past</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In many English versions, the relationship is ambiguous between the clause “we were chosen” in 1:11a and the clause “having been predestined” in 1:11b.

Just as the Jews became Christ’s people, the Gentiles also became Christ’s people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You as well</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And you also (NIV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And in Him:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>And in Him</em> is literally “in whom.” This is the first phrase in the verse and is repeated later in it. Scholars have different views about how these two occurrences of “in whom” are related to the other words in the context. See how you have translated the phrase “in him” or “in Christ” in other verses in this chapter (1:4a, 1:7a, 1:9b, 1:11a, 1:12a). Scholars have different views about how this phrase is connected to the rest of the sentence. The main views are:<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>Some scholars have suggested other verbs that may be implied here, for example, “were chosen,” obtained an inheritance,” or “were made an inheritance.” See the <em>Exegetical Summary of Ephesians</em>.</span></span></p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The phrase <em>in Him</em> is connected to the main verb (literally “sealed”) in 1:13c. It is repeated twice in Greek because other clauses come between the subject “you” and the main verb. (Notice that the GW does not repeat “in him.”.) For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>you were sealed in Him (NASB) <em>(BSB, RSV, NASB, REB, ESV, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>in Him</em> is connected to an implied form of the verb “to be,” that is, “you also (are) in him.” English versions that follow this interpretation express it in different ways. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were included in Christ (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>became God’s people (GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>in Him</em> is connected to the verb “believed/trusted” in 1:13a. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In whom ye also [trusted] (KJV) <em>(KJV, JBP, NET, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The phrase <em>in Him</em> is connected to the verb “heard.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Now you too, in him, have heard the message (NJB) <em>(NJB, probably CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This fits the structure of the Greek text and does not require a translator to supply another verb. However, it may be more natural in many languages to translate the phrase “in him” only once.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If this is true in your language, you may be able to follow an example like the GW as you translate this verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>13a–e</sup>You heard and believed the message of truth, the Good News that he has saved you. In him you were sealed with the Holy Spirit whom he promised. (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>having heard and believed:</strong> In some languages it may be necessary to specify what the Gentiles had hear and believed. In this context there are two possibilities:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>They heard and believed in the true message, the gospel of their salvation.</p></li><li><p>They heard and believed in Christ.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of (a) and (b) are almost the same, because the gospel is about Christ. Both options have good support. If you must make one of these options explicit, you may use whichever is more natural in your language in this context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the word of truth:</strong> The phrase that the BSB translates as <em>the word of truth</em> is literally “message of truth.” It is the first part of a parallelism with “the gospel of your salvation in 1:13b. It means “the word that is true” or “the true message <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span>” and refers to the gospel or Good News. See the note below in 1:13b on “the gospel of your salvation” for examples of how <em>the word of truth</em> has been translated.</p><h4>1:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the gospel of your salvation—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>which is the gospel about <span data-bnType=\"implied\">how God</span> saves you,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This true message</span> is the good news that can save you.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the gospel of your salvation:</strong> The phrase <em>the gospel of your salvation</em> means “the good news that saved you.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase along with “word of truth” in 1:13a:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the true message, the Good News that brought you salvation (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the truth, the Good News that God saves you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the truth, which is the good news about how you can be saved (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">For more information, see gospel and save, Word 2, in the Glossary.</p><h4>1:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>you were sealed</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and in Christ, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> put his seal/mark on you.</p></li><li><p>and by <span data-bnType=\"implied\">means of your</span> union with Christ, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God gave you</span> the Holy Spirit which he had promised/agreed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to give to his people</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you were sealed:</strong> The phrase <em>you were sealed</em> is the translation of one Greek verb. This verb is passive. In some languages it may be necessary to make it active and supply the agent “God.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> marked you with a seal</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In NT times a person used a special symbol to mark something that belonged to him. That was called his “seal.” Here Paul uses “seal” as a metaphor to describe the Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit that God gives his people is the seal to show they belong to him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this word:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Use a verb or noun in your language that means seal. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tribal mark</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>mark (put on animals) to show ownership</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile. If a metaphor is not clear (“God sealed you with the Holy Spirit”), you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>When in Christ God gave you the Holy Spirit, it was like he put his seal/mark on you.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>If this figure of speech is confusing, you may have to translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In Christ God gave you the Holy Spirit to show that you belong to him.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you:</strong> Here, the pronoun <em>you</em> refers to the Gentiles. To make clear the contrast with the Jews in 1:12, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you non-Jews</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you foreigners</p></blockquote><h4>1:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with the promised Holy Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This seal/mark is</span> the Holy Spirit which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he gave to you as</span> he promised.</p></li><li><p>The Spirit is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a mark <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which shows that you belong to God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the promised Holy Spirit:</strong> The phrase <em>the promised Holy Spirit</em> means “the Holy Spirit that God had promised to give to his people.” See Holy, Meaning 3 in the Glossary for more information.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 1:13e</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">There is implied information here. The purpose of the believers being marked with the seal (the promised Holy Spirit) was to show themselves and/or other people that they belonged to God. If this purpose is not clear, you may want to make it explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>were given the promised Holy Spirit to show that you belong to God (CEV)</p></blockquote></div>",

Inheritance literally refers to the money or property that someone receives when a relative dies. In its figurative sense, <em>inheritance</em> in this context refers to all the good things that God will give his people.

(NET) <em>(BSB, RSV, NASB, NET, KJV, GW, NCV, NJB, NLT, NCV, REB, JBP, ESV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>the <u>Holy Spirit</u>.

The Spirit will make you wise and let you understand… (CEV) <em>(NIV, GNT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of English translations. In some languages, it will be more natural to translate <em>spirit of wisdom</em> as “spiritually wise.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and revelation:</strong> The word <em>revelation</em> generally refers to something that has been made known. In this context it refers to God making himself known to people. In some languages, it will be more natural to translate the noun <em>revelation</em> as the verb “reveal.” Paul prayed that God would reveal himself to the Ephesian Christians.

In Jewish culture, the heart of a person represented his ability to think and understand. It also represented the person himself.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>that you may be enabled to understand</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><em>that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened</em> is a passive clause.

Consider how you can connect 1:18a and 1:18b in a natural way in your language. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>That <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> would help you understand the hope…</p></blockquote><h4>1:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"1:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you may know the hope of His calling,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in order that you may understand the hope which <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he promised to you when</span> he called you.</p></li><li><p>so that you will know the good things he has for you.

It was so that they would understand “the hope to which he had called them.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the hope of His calling:</strong> The phrase <em>the hope of His calling</em> refers to the blessings that God promised to give to us. We can hope to receive these blessings, which He promised to give us when he called us to be his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hope:</strong> The Greek word which the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> means “to confidently expect and wait for something that we know will happen.” Christian hope includes the ideas that God is actively working in the lives of all believers and that they will live forever with him in heaven. The Greek meaning of <em>hope</em> is different from the modern English meaning. In modern English, <em>hope</em> means little more than “wish.” This is not the Greek meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>confidence (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>confidently expect</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>calling:</strong> The word <em>calling</em> here means that “God called (invited, summoned) us to be his people.” In some languages, it is clearer to make this explicit.

Paul stressed that God has done many things for them because he is kind, so they should not be proud.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Made alive in Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>From Death to life (GNT, CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God Saved Us Because of His Great Love for Us (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Because God is loving and kind he saved us<sup>(incl)</sup></p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050002001\" data-endVerseId=\"1050002003\"><h3>Paragraph 2:1–3</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul described the condition of the Ephesians before they became Christians. They were spiritually “dead” because of their sins, Satan controlled them, and God was angry with them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">To begin this paragraph, a good model to follow is the GNT. The GNT starts this paragraph with the phrase “in the past” to show that Paul was talking about the former condition of the Ephesians. The CEV and NCV also begin this paragraph in the same way. Some other ways you can make this implied information clear are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">formerly</span> you were dead</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As for you, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">before you believed</span> you were dead</p></blockquote></div><h4>2:1–2</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The BSB and some other English versions translate 2:1–2 as one long sentence.

It refers to the Ephesian Christians. Try to show this emphasis in your language in a way that is natural. This sentence means “you<sup>(plur)</sup> were dead <u>because of</u> your transgressions and sins.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>dead:</strong> Here the word <em>dead</em> refers to spiritual death, not physical death. Because of their sins, they were like dead people as far as the things of God were concerned. They could not respond to God at all. In many languages, it is better to translate this as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you were like dead people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it was as if you were dead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to make the point of comparison explicit.

The clause <em>God raised us up with Christ</em> means the same thing as “made us<sup>(incl)</sup> alive with Christ” in 2:5a. When we trusted in Christ, God raised us up in a spiritual sense. He raised us up from spiritual death and gave us spiritual life.

It normally refers to a king or leader sitting on his throne to rule with power and authority.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In this verse, Paul again used a metaphor to compare us with Christ. When Christ ascended to heaven, he sat at the right hand of God to rule (a position of authority). When people trust in Christ, they receive the Holy Spirit, who gives them the power to rule in a spiritual sense. It is in this sense that believers are seated with Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has given us a place beside Christ (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>has given us a position in heaven with him (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the heavenly realms:</strong> The phrase <em>in the heavenly realms</em> means “in the spiritual places” or “the supernatural world.” It is a general term that describes the invisible spirit world. This includes heaven, but it also includes the areas where all types of spirits use their power. In this context it refers to heaven.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase occurs only five times in the New Testament, and all of them are in Ephesians (see also 1:3b, 1:20b, 3:10a–b, 6:12b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the spiritual realm/world</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the world of unseen beings/spirits</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the unseen world of spiritual beings</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> means God “united believers with Christ Jesus.” The phrase repeats how God raised up us believers with Christ and made us sit with him in heaven.

Previously Jews and Gentiles were enemies. But Christ, by his death on the cross, has made peace between both groups of people and God. Because of this, there is peace between the two groups also. So the Gentile Christians now belong to the family of God just like Jewish Christians do.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ has united all people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>All people are one in Christ</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050002011\" data-endVerseId=\"1050002013\"><h3>Paragraph 2:11–13</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Paul again describes the former condition of the Ephesians: they did not share in any of the privileges of the Jews. They were far from God and had no hope. But now they have been brought close to God because Christ died in their place for their sins.</p></div><h4>2:11–12</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">Verses 2:11–12 are one complex sentence in Greek and in the BSB. The main verb of this sentence is “remember,” which occurs at the beginning of 2:11. However, the main things that Paul wants the Ephesians to remember are listed in 2:12. To show this relationship, some good translation models to follow are the NCV and GNT. The NCV places “remember” in 2:12. The GNT places “remember” at the end of 2:11.</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11</sup>You were not born Jewish. You are the people the Jews call “uncircumcised.” Those who call you “uncircumcised” call themselves “circumcised.” (Their circumcision is only something they themselves do on their bodies.) <sup>12a</sup><u>Remember</u> that in the past you were without Christ… (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>11</sup>You Gentiles by birth—called “the uncircumcised” by the Jews, who call themselves the circumcised (which refers to what men do to their bodies)—<u>remember</u> what you were in the past. (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Although the BSB does not break this into shorter sentences, it does repeat the verb “remember” in 2:12a.</p><h4>2:11</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">This verse refers to a particular Jewish custom called “circumcision.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Circumcision is the cutting off of a band of skin, called the foreskin, from around the end of the penis.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">You may want to use a euphemism to describe this event. Some examples are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>mark</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>receive the mark</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">Circumcision was the special mark or sign God gave to the Jews which showed they were his chosen people. Since the Gentiles did not practice circumcision, this showed that they did not belong to God’s chosen people.</p><h4>2:11a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Therefore remember that formerly you who are Gentiles in the flesh</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore, you who were born Gentiles, remember how you were in the past.</p></li><li><p>¶ Do not forget that you were not born Jewish.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Therefore:</strong> The conjunction <em>Therefore</em> refers back to 2:1–10. Paul is reminding the Ephesians again of what they were like before they became Christians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So then (NRSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>remember that formerly you who are Gentiles in the flesh:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>remember</em> is a command. It means “keep in mind” or “think of.” Most English versions translate it positively, <em>remember</em>. A few versions translate it using a negative, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>do not forget (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>formerly:</strong> The word <em>formerly</em> means “in the past” or “previously.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>before <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you believed in Christ</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>prior <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to becoming a Christian</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>Gentiles:</strong> This word <em>Gentiles</em> refers to all people who are not Jews. See Gentiles, Meaning 1 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>non-Jews</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who are not Jews</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the flesh:</strong> The Greek phrase which the BSB literally translates as <em>in the flesh</em> refers to the fact that the Ephesians were not circumcised physically (in the flesh) like the Jews were. They were born Gentiles. See flesh, Meaning 5, in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Don’t forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Remember that once you were not Jewish physically. (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>2:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and called uncircumcised by the so-called circumcision</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>You were called “uncircumcised” by the Jews, who call themselves “the circumcised.”</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">The Jews</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">insultingly</span> say to you, “you are uncircumcised people.” <span data-bnType=\"implied\">They say this because they proudly consider themselves to be the people of God because</span> they are circumcised.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>called uncircumcised:</strong> When a Jew called someone <em>uncircumcised</em>, he was insulting him. To a Jew, anyone who was uncircumcised was a pagan, which is an unbeliever. If the verb for <em>called</em> in your language has only a positive meaning, you may need to choose another verb or add a word such as “insult” to give the proper meaning of this clause.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>uncircumcised heathen</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">despicable</span> people without the mark of God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the so-called circumcision:</strong> The phrase <em>by the so-called circumcision</em> refers to the Jewish people. They called themselves the <em>circumcision</em> because their men were circumcised. You may need to make the meaning more explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the Jews, who call themselves the circumcised (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Jewish people who say, “we are circumcised people.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This context implies that the Jews were proud of this sign that they were God’s chosen people. In some languages it may be helpful to make this explicit. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Jews, who were proud of their circumcision (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>marked as God’s chosen people</p></blockquote><h4>2:11c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:11c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>(that done in the body by human hands)—</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>(which refers to what men do to their bodies.) (GNT)</p></li><li><p>But circumcision is only <span data-bnType=\"implied\">a ceremony</span> which men do to their bodies.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In 2:11c, Paul says two things about circumcision. These are discussed in the following two notes.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that done in the body:</strong> The first thing that Paul said about circumcision is that it is <em>done in the body</em>. This means it is a ritual that someone does to a man’s body. Paul implied that circumcision affects a man’s outward appearance, but does not change his heart or change his behavior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>body:</strong> This is literally “flesh.” See flesh, Meaning 1 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by human hands:</strong> The second thing that Paul said about circumcision is that it is done <em>by human hands</em>. This means it is something people do, not something God does.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In other words, circumcision is only an outward, physical ceremony. A person may be circumcised following the Jewish religion, but that does not mean that the person has allowed God to change his inner being. (See Romans 2:28–29 and Colossians 2:11.)</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 2:11c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">2:11c is background information Paul gives explaining about circumcision. The BSB has used parentheses to indicate this. Try to indicate it in a natural way in your language.</p></div>",

In this context it refers to the message of salvation. Christ came into the world and preached that there is now peace between man and God. Some English versions make this association with the message of salvation explicit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the phrase “preached peace”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>So Christ came and preached the Good News of peace to all (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He brought this Good News of peace to you (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He announced that his death would do away with that hostility/hatred between the two</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you who were far away:</strong> The pronoun <em>you</em> refers to the Ephesians who were Gentiles. This is stating their condition before they believed in Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>far away:</strong> As in 2:13a–b, the phrase <em>far away</em> is a figure of speech that means that they were “far away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from God</span>.” They did not have a close relationship with God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If this figure of speech is not clear in your language, you may want to use different words, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you who had no relationship with God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you who were spiritually separated from God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated <em>far away</em> in 2:13a–b.</p><h4>2:17b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:17b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and peace to those who were near.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us</span><sup>(excl)</sup> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> who were near <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span>.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He also preached</span> to us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> who had a close <span data-bnType=\"implied\">relationship to God</span>, saying that there is now peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">between man and God</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>peace:</strong> The Greek text repeats the word <em>peace</em> in 2:17a and 2:17b. If it is not natural to repeat this word in your language, here is a way you can translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ came and preached peace to you who were far away from God, and to those who were near to God. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to those who were near:</strong> The phrase <em>those who were near</em> refers to the Jews. Since Paul was also a Jew, it is possible to translate this clause using a first person plural pronoun (us). For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> who were near</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>near:</strong> The word <em>near</em> (like the expression “far away” in 2:17a) is a figure of speech here. The Jews were near to God because they had a special relationship with him. He had chosen them to be his special people. It does not mean that they were physically near or close to God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If this figure of speech is not clear in your language, you may want to use different words, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those people who had a close relationship with him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jews</span> who are his chosen/special people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate 2:17:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To you non-Jews who are far and to you Jews who are near, he came and said this, “Live in peace <span data-bnType=\"implied\">together</span>.”</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>outsiders</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages translate <em>foreigners</em> as a phrase, such as “not part of God’s people.” So to say, “no longer strangers and foreigners” makes a complicated sentence with two negatives, such as “You are no longer not a part of God’s people.” To avoid this you can make two sentences, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the past it was like you were on the outside, you were not part of God’s people.

Most English versions translate the Greek literally, and it is not possible to tell which interpretation they follow. In some languages, a literal translation would mean that the apostles and prophets owned the foundations, so be careful to avoid such a meaning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>foundation:</strong> In New Testament times the houses were built on rocks to make them solid. These rocks were called the <em>foundation</em>. If your language has no word for foundation, you may need to say something like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>rocks that they build the house on</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>apostles:</strong> The <em>apostles</em> are the twelve disciples plus Paul and perhaps a few other men. See how you translated “apostle” in 1:1b. See apostle in the Glossary if you want more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>prophets:</strong> In this context, <em>prophets</em> were people in the church to whom God gave a spiritual gift. This gift enabled the person to speak a message from God. Most commentators think that the <em>prophets</em> Paul was talking about were New Testament prophets rather than Old Testament prophets. (See Acts 13:1, Ephesians 3:5, Ephesians 4:11.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>spokesmen for God</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>men who speak God’s words</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s message-speakers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See prophet in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>2:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone.</p></li><li><p>And Christ Jesus himself is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the main stone support for the house.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>cornerstone:</strong> The Greek word the BSB translates as <em>cornerstone</em> was the largest and most important stone in the building.

It first occurred in 1:7a. It means that Christ is doing the work of joining and building the building.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>whole building:</strong> The phrase <em>whole building</em> is part of the apostle Paul’s metaphor comparing the church to a building or house. See the above note on 2:20–22 for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fitted together:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>fitted together</em> is a technical building term. It refers to cutting or shaping stones so that they fit exactly together in the building, then fastening together the cut stones with metal pegs. (This verb occurs only here and in 4:16.) This metaphor refers to the Jews and Gentiles being joined or united together in the church.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He is the one who holds the whole building together (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In him all the parts of the building fit together (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>2:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"2:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and grows into a holy temple in the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">because of him, the house</span> becomes bigger, so that it becomes a holy temple for the Lord.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he causes/makes the house</span> to become larger, so in that way it becomes a house dedicated to the Lord.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>grows into a holy temple in the Lord:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>grows</em> means “to get larger.” In some languages the word “grow” may not be appropriate to describe a building becoming larger.

If this is true in your language you may indicate that Christ is the one who causes the temple to get larger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>makes it grow into a holy temple for the Lord (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span> builds it into a holy temple for the Lord</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy temple:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB here translates as <em>temple</em> specifically refers to the Holy of Holies. It was the room in the temple where God’s presence lived. The word <em>holy</em> means that this temple is dedicated/set apart for God. In some languages, there is no special word for temple or sanctuary. Instead a phrase like “worship place” or “God’s house” is used. See holy, Meaning 1 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a place set apart <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">where God resides</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a temple, wholly dedicated <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and filled with his presence</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s big holy house</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the Lord:</strong> By using the word <em>Lord</em>, Paul probably meant the Lord Jesus, but some commentators think Paul means Lord God. If possible, leave this ambiguous in your translation. If this is impossible then choose “the Lord Jesus” as the majority of the commentaries consulted favor this view.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>in the Lord</em> means that the temple is “for the Lord” (see the NLT) or “dedicated to the Lord” (see GNT).</p>",

Both Gentiles and Jews equally share all that God promises and gives to his children. The word <em>promise</em> is singular, and it sums up all that God has promised his people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>promise of blessings (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> means “through Christ Jesus” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the promise that God made through Christ Jesus (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Through our union with Christ, God’s plan has been fulfilled.

The Greek text begins 3:8a with an emphatic “To me,” as in the RSV. Try to find a natural way in the language to show this emphasis. Some other versions do this by adding “but” or “yet” at the beginning of 3:8b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am the least of all God’s people. Yet, God showed me his kindness… (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I am the least important of all God’s people. But God was kind… (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>I am less than the least:</strong> The phrase <em>less than the least</em> is a strong statement that means “the very least” or “the most unimportant.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul humbly said that he was not important. Try to find a strong expression in your language. Be careful that your translation does not mean that Paul was physically smaller or weaker than other believers. In some languages the correct idea can be expressed by an idiom, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am behind all God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am lower than all God’s people</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If your language makes comparisons by contrasting one phrase with another, you may need to translate this phrase in a different way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All of God’s people might have a name, but I have no name, I am underneath everyone.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>all the saints:</strong> A literal English translation of the Greek is “holy ones.” It means “people set apart for God.” This Greek word refers to every believer.

Some other ways that English versions translate this conjunction are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s purpose in all this was… (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He did this so that now… (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the church:</strong> The phrase <em>through the church</em> refers to the church as the means by which the rulers and authorities would come to know God’s wisdom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s purpose in all this was to use the church to display his wisdom in its rich variety to all the unseen rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>church:</strong> The word <em>church</em> refers to all believers in Christ throughout the world. In the New Testament, the word church never refers to a building. See how you translated <em>church</em> in 1:22b. See church in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>3:10b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:10b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to make known his many kinds of wisdom to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all</span> the <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spirit beings</span> who rule and have authority in the unseen world.</p></li><li><p>how wise he is in everything. God uses the church as an example of this,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the manifold wisdom of God:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>manifold</em> literally means “many-sided,” or “very varied.” So the phrase <em>manifold wisdom</em> means that God is “wise in all ways.” He is not just wise in one area.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his infinite wisdom (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he has many different kinds of wisdom (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God’s wisdom, which has so many forms (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God is very wise in everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he does</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>should be made known:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>should be made known</em> is a passive. If it would be more natural in your language to make this active, you can:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>supply God as the agent. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God/he should make known</p></blockquote></li><li><p>supply God as the agent and translate the verb as “show.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s purpose was to <u>show</u> his wisdom (NLT96)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>make rulers and authorities the subject. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the rulers and powers in the heavenly world will now know God’s wisdom (NCV)</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the rulers and authorities:</strong> The words <em>rulers</em> and <em>authorities</em> can refer to either:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>human beings who rule on earth or</p></li><li><p>spirit beings who rule in the heavens</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In this context with the phrase “in the heavenly realms” that follows, these words refer to spirit beings. These beings are good angels and evil spirits. These are probably the same spiritual powers Paul talked about in 1:21a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate these words:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>angelic rulers and powers (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>unseen rulers and authorities (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the heavenly realms:</strong> The phrase <em>the heavenly realms</em> refers to the area above the earth where the spirits were thought to live. This does not refer to heaven where God is.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the heavenly world (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the heavenly places (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the spiritual world (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:10a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages it may be more natural to put the phrase “through the church” in 3:10a at the end of 3:10b.

It means that we have the ability and right to enter God’s presence. As in 2:18, it is best in many languages to translate this phrase as a verb.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bold confidence (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>boldness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>boldness</em> is literally “boldness.” It means that believers do not have to be afraid when they pray to God or worship him.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>confidence:</strong> The word <em>confidence</em> means to have “complete trust; belief in one’s own or another’s ability.” In this context, it is similar in meaning to “boldness” and strengthens it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without fear (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>trust</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:12a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it will be more natural to reverse the order of 3:12a and 3:12b.

They bowed down on their knees instead of standing up. So in this context, <em>bow my knees</em> represents the act of praying. You may need to complete the thought.

(See the discussion on “whole family” below.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>every family:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>every</em> generally means “all.” So there is an interpretation issue here. This phrase can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>each</u> or <u>every</u> family. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…from whom every family in heaven and on the earth is named.

The phrase <em>in heaven</em> refers to angels (beings who are spiritual or in heaven). The phrase <em>on earth</em> refers to humans (beings who are on earth).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The angels and humans are referred to as belonging to families. Here the word <em>family</em> refers to extended families like “clans” or “races,” or even “nations” of people. (It does <u>not</u> refer to the more common meaning of family consisting of a father, mother and their children.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Since angels are not normally considered to be in families, the word <em>family</em> may cause some problems. For examples of ways to translate the phrase <em>family in heaven and on earth</em>, see below.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>derives its name:</strong> The phrase <em>derives its name</em> is a figurative way to say that God gives every heavenly being and every human being its life and character. He is the Creator of everything in heaven and earth. He causes every group to exist.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Be careful to avoid a translation that gives the impression that God has given every family its surname.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>All beings in heaven and on earth receive their life from him.

The BSB (and many other English versions) has added them here, and in 3:17c, to make the translation clearer.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>out of the riches of His glory:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>out of the riches of His glory</em> is literally “according to the wealth of the glory of him.” Both “wealth” and “glory” refer here to God’s unlimited resources, to everything he has and is. He is infinite in his goodness, power, and love. See glory, Meaning 4 in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from his glorious, unlimited resources (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>from the wealth of his glory (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Because this is Paul’s prayer to God, it may be more natural to use direct speech here.

He asked God to strengthen them by the Holy Spirit so that Christ could live in them.

Generally, people cannot know something that surpasses knowledge. People cannot know something that is beyond knowing. But that is Paul’s prayer here. Paul used this statement to emphasize that human beings can never <u>completely</u> know or understand how much Christ loves them but they can experience that love.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>know this love:</strong> The phrase <em>know this love</em> refers to <u>experiencing</u> Christ’s love. It is more than simply knowing about Christ’s love. It means that believers have experienced or seen how much Christ loves them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>surpasses knowledge:</strong> The phrase <em>surpasses knowledge</em> means “beyond knowing.” Christ’s love is so great that people cannot completely know or understand it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May you experience the love of Christ, though it is so great you will never fully understand it. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I want you to know all about Christ’s love, although it is too wonderful to be measured. (CEV)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:18b-19a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In the BSB, the phrase “of the love of Christ” is placed at the beginning of verse 19. However, in some other English translations, such as the NIV, this phrase is placed at the end of verse 18b. In some languages, it may be helpful to combine or reorder 3:18b-19a to create simplier sentences. See the meaning lines in 3:18b-19a for different ideas of how to translate these verse parts.</p><h5><strong>General Comment on 3:19a</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions have a “—” at the end of 3:19a. This is to show the reader that what follows, 3:19b, is a comment inserted here by Paul. Other English versions, like the BSB, do not do this, so it is recommended that you do not use a “—” at the end of this verse part.</p></div><h4>3:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that God may fill you with his nature/character.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray this</span> so that your character may become like God’s character.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray this,</span> so that you will become complete/mature in every way, just as God is.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>that you may be filled with all the fullness of God:</strong> 3:19b is the purpose of Paul’s prayer in 3:17 and 18. Here is a summary of these verses:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(3:17a) I pray that Christ will live in your hearts…and</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(3:18–19a) I pray that you will know Christ’s love</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(3:19b) <u>so that</u> you may be completely filled with God’s character</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>filled with all the fullness of God:</strong> The clause <em>filled with all the fullness of God</em> means:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>completely filled with the very nature of God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>filled</em> and <em>fullness</em> are figures of speech. To be full of God’s fullness means to have character qualities that are completely like his. Paul prayed that the Ephesians would be the kind of people God wants them to be. He prayed that they would be mature, loving and wise, with strong faith, peace, joy and all the other characteristics God wants to give them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it is not natural to use the verb “fill” when referring to “character.” If that is the case in your language, you can leave out the figure of being <em>filled</em> and translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I pray this so</span> that you may become completely like God in your character.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and so be completely filled with the very nature of God (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God (NLT)</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>That God’s name be big</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>May he be honored through Christ</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Using the form of a command.

When Paul said, “to him [be] glory” he meant “God should be praised because of his greatness.” Some ways to translate this are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God be praised for his greatness</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Praise God because of his greatness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which is seen</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May people speak very highly about God’s goodness/majesty/bigness</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">He did not mean that God must be given some glory because he does not have any.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See glory, Meaning 2 in the Glossary for more information.<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>To “give God glory” is a common Hebrew expression for praising God. See, for example Isaiah 24:15, Psalm 96:7–8, 115:1, and also Luke 2:12. We do not actually <u>give</u> God glory in the sense that we give him something he did not have. He already has glory. To give him glory means to say that he has glory, to praise him because of his glory. The expression “glorify God” means the same thing: to praise him. See, for example, Psalm 34:3, Daniel 4:34, Luke 2:20, Romans 1:21, 15:6.</span></span></p><h4>3:21b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>in the church and in Christ Jesus</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>in his people and in Christ Jesus.</p></li><li><p>through those who believe in Christ and through/Christ Jesus himself</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in the church:</strong> The word <em>church</em> here means “God’s people” or “the people who believe in Christ.” It does not refer to a building.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">So the phrase “To God be glory <em>in the church</em>” means that God’s people should glorify God through what they do. People should see God’s glory in his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 3:21a–b:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Praise God because of his greatness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which is seen/shown</span> in his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>God deserves/merits praise because of his power <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which others can see</span> in his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Let us praise God for his greatness <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which</span> his people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">display/show</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Also, see how you translated <em>church</em> in 3:10a. And see church in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in Christ Jesus:</strong> The phrase <em>in Christ Jesus</em> is parallel grammatically to the phrase “in the church.” We should also praise God because of his greatness that is seen in the church and in Christ Jesus. It may be helpful to translate 3:21a–b as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>To him be praise <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for his glory which is seen</span> both in the church and in Christ Jesus</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to translate these two phrases <em>in Christ Jesus</em> and “in the church” as two different clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>May God’s name be truly high among God’s people, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and</span> through the work of Christ Jesus, may God’s name always be high with no end.</p></blockquote><h4>3:21c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"3:21c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>throughout all generations, forever and ever.

So be it.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>throughout all generations, forever and ever:</strong> The phrase <em>throughout all generations</em> and the phrase <em>forever and ever</em> both refer to very long periods of time. Paul used both statements to emphasize that people should never stop praising God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When you translate these phrases, you will need to decide:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>whether it is more natural to combine these two phrases into one.

In this section, Paul showed how those truths should affect the way we live. He urged the Ephesian Christians to behave in the way that would keep their unity. He explained in detail the basis of this unity. He also explained that Christ gives believers power to do different tasks so that the church may become strong and mature. Mature believers should no longer be influenced by false teaching. Instead, they will proclaim the truth, and the church, with Christ as its head, will grow as it should and become strong.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Unity of the body of Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ’s gifts to the church</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live in unity, using God’s gifting to strengthen believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul urges the Ephesians to live a life of unity in Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers in Christ should live in unity, strengthening each other</p></blockquote></div><h4>4:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>As a prisoner in the Lord, then,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because of all this,</span> therefore, I, who am a prisoner for <span data-bnType=\"implied\">serving</span> the Lord,</p></li><li><p>¶ Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of all that God has done for you</span>, now I, who am in prison because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I serve</span> the Lord <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span>,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>prisoner in the Lord:</strong> The phrase <em>prisoner in the Lord</em> means that Paul was in prison for serving the Lord.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase is the same as the phrase “prisoner of Christ Jesus” in 3:1b, though the Greek is not exactly the same. Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am imprisoned because I serve the Lord</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">People</span> put me in prison for serving my Master <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Jesus</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Lord:</strong> Here the phrase <em>the Lord</em> refers to Jesus. The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>Lord</em> means “master” or “one who has authority over others.” People used this word as a polite title when they spoke to an elder or someone in authority. However, the Jews also used this same title to refer to God. Paul here recognizes Jesus as his sovereign Master who had authority from God and is the Son of God. Use a term in your language that could also be used in this way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Master</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Chief</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Owner</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sovereign God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages it may be necessary to add a word like “my” before such a term of address. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>my Chief/Sovereign</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> connects all that Paul had taught in chapters 1–3 to the advice that he gave in chapters 4–6. This is not a time word. Paul began his advice by urging the Ephesians to behave like Christians should because of all that God had done for them.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the main idea here:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Because of all this</span> therefore…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Because <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of all that God has done for you</span>, I urge you…</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The BSB has placed the conjunction <em>then</em> after the phrase “prisoner for the Lord” because it is good English style. In Greek, this conjunction occurs before the phrase “prisoner for the Lord.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord… (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may not be necessary to explicitly show a connection here. In such cases, you may leave this conjunction untranslated.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:1a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The Greek text of 4:1a–b is literally “I encourage therefore you, I, the prisoner of the Lord…” Paul repeats the pronoun “I” when he adds that he is a prisoner in the Lord. He does this to emphasize that he is in prison for the Lord, and this gives added authority to the advice he is going to give to the Ephesians in the following sections. As you translate 4:1a–c, try to include this emphasis in your translation in a natural way.</p></div><h4>4:1b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:1b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>I urge you to walk in a manner worthy</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I encourage you to live/behave <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in a way that is</span> worthy</p></li><li><p>I beg you to live in a way that is fitting for believers.

In your language, it may not be possible to use “one” with things like “faith” and “baptism.” This is especially true if you translate these words as verbs instead of nouns. Think of a natural way to translate these verses so that Paul’s emphasis on unity is clear. For example, you could translate “one Spirit” as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we all have received the same Spirit</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:4, Paul uses the pronoun “you.” But the things he says in 4:4–6 are true not only for the Ephesians, but also for Paul and all believers. Because of this, some translators use “we<sup>(incl)</sup>” in these verses.</p><h4>4:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>There is one body and one Spirit,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>We are all part of one body and we have <span data-bnType=\"implied\">received</span> the same Spirit.</p></li><li><p>We are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like parts of</span> the same body, and we have the same Holy Spirit dwelling in us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>There is one body:</strong> The phrase <em>one body</em> refers to the group of believers called the church. This group of Christians is the body of Christ (1:23). All of us believers are like <span data-bnType=\"implied\">parts of</span> the same body. So, another way to translate this phrase is a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We are like one body</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>one Spirit:</strong> The phrase <em>one Spirit</em> refers to the Holy Spirit. All believers have the same Holy Spirit living/dwelling in them.</p><h4>4:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as you were called to one hope when you were called;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>In the same way, God called/chose you to hope/expect the same good things/blessings.</p></li><li><p>In the same manner, we are all hoping for the same things/blessings <span data-bnType=\"implied\">which God promised us</span> when he called/chose us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>just as you were called to one hope:</strong> The clause <em>just as you were called to one hope</em> is a comparison. There is one body and one Spirit just as there is one hope. (See General Comment below for ways to translate this.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>you were called:</strong> The phrase <em>you were called</em> is passive. If it would be more natural in your language to use an active clause here, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>just as <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God</span> called you to one hope</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>called:</strong> As in 4:1c, here are some other ways to translate the verb <em>called</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>invited</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"4\"><p>chosen</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated “calling” in 4:1c and <em>called</em> in 1:18b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one hope:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>hope</em> means “to confidently expect and wait for something that we know will happen.” The meaning of the Greek word that is translated as <em>hope</em> is different from the modern English meaning. In modern English, <em>hope</em> is closer to a “wish.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages <em>hope</em> is easier to understand if translated as a verb rather than a noun. So you may need to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>you are hoping for/expecting the same good things/blessings</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated <em>hope</em> in 1:18b and 2:12d.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>when you were called:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>when you were called</em> is literally “of your calling” (as in the NRSV). This phrase repeats the phrase “you were called” that is found earlier in 4:4b. So some translations combine these two phrases. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>just as there is one hope to which God has called you (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 4:4b:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the same way you were called to share one hope.

(NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>In the same way, when God called/chose you, he chose you to hope/expect the same good things/blessings.</p></blockquote>",

Paul also meant that we all were baptized as a symbol that we are Christians. In the first century, when Paul wrote this letter, baptism had not yet become an issue that Christians argued about.

Baptism was something that all Christians had in common.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Some people think Paul was talking about being baptized by the Holy Spirit here (see 1 Corinthians 12:13), but most people think he was talking about water baptism.

In a parade to celebrate his victory, he went up the hill to Mount Zion in Jerusalem. During the parade, he forced some of the enemy soldiers he had captured to follow along behind him and implied in this passage is that from the plunder he gave gifts to his followers/soldiers.</p><h4>4:8a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:8a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>This is why it says:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>This is why the Scriptures say:</p></li><li><p>It is as they/someone wrote in the Book of God:</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>This is why:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translated <em>This is why</em> indicates that Paul used the quote in 4:8b–c to support what he has just said in 4:7.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is supported by</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Therefore (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>it says:</strong> The pronoun <em>it</em> here refers to the Scriptures.

Paul saw this as a picture of Christ ascending to heaven. Just as the king won a victory and then went up to a high place, so also Christ won a victory (over sin and death) and then went up to a high place (God’s right side in heaven).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Since this is a quotation from the Psalms, you should translate <em>on high</em> in 4:8b in a general way. In the Psalm, <em>on high</em> refers to Mount Zion, so do not translate it “to heaven” here.

So the pronoun <em>He</em> refers to Christ, and you can translate it that way if necessary. To make it clear that Christ descended before he ascended, the GNT says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>first came down (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the word <em>descended</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>came down (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>had gone down (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the lower parts of the earth:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB literally translates as <em>to the lower parts of the earth</em> may refer to:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>the <u>earth</u> below in contrast to the highest heaven. This refers to where Christ was when he became a human. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This clearly means that Christ also descended to our lowly world (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, REB, JBP, NLT, ESV, NET, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>Hades</u>. This refers to where Christ was after he died. According to some interpretations of 1 Peter 3:18 and 1 Peter 4:6, Christ descended into Hades after his death.

He explained in detail the basis of this unity. He also explained that Christ gives believers power to do different tasks so that the church may become strong and mature. Mature believers should no longer be influenced by false teaching. Instead, they will proclaim the truth, and the church, with Christ as its head, will grow as it should and become strong.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Unity of the body of Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ’s gifts to the church</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live in unity, using God’s gifting to strengthen believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul urges the Ephesians to live a life of unity in Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers in Christ should live in unity, strengthening each other</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050004007\" data-endVerseId=\"1050004016\"><h3>Paragraph 4:7–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:4–6 Paul talked about the things that unite Christians. These are things that we have in common. But in 4:7 he talked about special abilities that some Christians have and that others do not have. We <u>all</u> have the <u>same</u> Spirit, we <u>all</u> worship the <u>same</u> Lord, and so on. <u>But</u> to <u>each</u> of us, Christ has given different special abilities.</p></div><h4>4:13a-d</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In the Greek text, 4:13 contains three phrases each of which start with the same preposition <em>eis</em>, “to”:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>to become unified…</p></li><li><p>to become mature…</p></li><li><p>to become perfect like Christ…</p></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\">Commentators connect these phrases in many ways. The two main interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>all three phrases are separate goals. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>This is to continue</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13b</sup> <u>until</u> all of us are united in our faith and in our knowledge about God’s Son,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13c</sup> <u>until</u> we become mature,</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13d</sup> <u>until</u> we measure up to Christ, who is the standard. (GW) <em>(RSV, NASB, CEV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>the first two phrases are separate goals, and the third phrase further describes the second. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13a</sup>This work must continue</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13b</sup>until we are all joined together in the same faith and in the same knowledge of the Son of God.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>13c</sup>We must become like a mature person, <sup>13d</sup>growing until we become like Christ and have his perfection. (NCV) <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NJB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). The three goals for the church are that they shall:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>be united in their faith and knowledge of Christ (4:13b),</p></li><li><p>become mature believers (4:13c) and</p></li><li><p>become completely like Christ (4:13d).</p></li></ol><h4>4:13a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>until we all</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The goal is for all of us</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This will continue</span> so that we all</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>until:</strong> The word <em>until</em> here means that this is the goal of what Paul said in 4:11–12. Christ gave special abilities to some believers (4:11) in order to prepare all believers to work for him (4:12a) and to make us all united (4:12b). This will continue <u>until</u> we all become united (4:13b), mature (4:13c) and like Christ (4:13d).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>we all:</strong> The words <em>we all</em> refer to all of us who are believers.</p><h4>4:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to become united/one by means of the faith <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span> and in our knowledge of the Son of God,</p></li><li><p>become joined as one in the faith/teaching <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span> and by knowing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Christ</span>, the Son of God</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God:</strong> Here, <em>faith</em> and <em>knowledge</em> are the <u>means</u> of our coming to <em>unity</em>. We become united because we believe in the Son of God and know him. In some languages, it will be clearer to translate these three abstract nouns (<em>unity</em>, <em>faith</em>, <em>knowledge</em>) as verbs. These are discussed below.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>reach unity in the faith:</strong> Here, <em>reach unity</em> means “to come together like one,” “to become joined together as one” or “to become united.”</p><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>the faith:</strong> Here <em>the faith</em> refers to a general belief or trust in something or someone. There are two main interpretations.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>This refers to belief in the <u>true Christian teachings</u>. If you follow this interpretation, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by believing in the truth/teaching <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about Christ</span> and knowing the Son of God</p></blockquote></li><li><p>This refers to belief in the <u>Son of God</u>. Some commentators say that “Son of God” is the object of both “knowledge” and <em>faith</em>. If you follow this interpretation, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by believing in the Son of God and knowing him</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">In 4:5a, Paul listed “one faith” and its meaning was “belief in the true Christian teachings.” The context suggested that <em>the faith</em> has the same meaning here. So, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See faith, Meaning 1 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are united by our faith and by our understanding of the Son of God. (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>are all joined together in the same faith and in the same knowledge of the Son of God. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the Son of God:</strong> The phrase <em>the Son of God</em> is a title for Jesus. This title was often used to refer to a savior who would be a descendant of King David. God would send this savior to rescue his people. This person was often referred to as the “Messiah” or “Christ.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The title <em>the Son of God</em> also indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. The relationship between God the Father and Jesus, his Son, is similar in some way to the relationship between human fathers and sons. God the Father does not have a physical body. He did not have a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. The Son of God existed eternally as the Son with his Father.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In areas where people do not understand the title <em>the Son of God</em> in this way, you may want to include a footnote that explains the correct meaning. Here is a suggested footnote:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This title refers to Jesus. It indicates that Jesus has the same nature and character as God. It does not mean that God the Father had a sexual relationship with Mary that resulted in her becoming pregnant and giving birth to Jesus. Mary became pregnant with Jesus in a miraculous way by the Holy Spirit of God.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it is natural to speak of a son as a “child,” without specifying male or female. If that is true in your language, you may use a more general term, such as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the Child of God<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>A translation of the title “the Son of God” must include a familial term such as “son” or “child.” Translations such as “the man who is God,” “the divine man,” or “the God man” are not acceptable, since they do not retain familial language. Examples of acceptable translation options include “the Son who comes from God,” and “the divine/unique/eternal Son of God.”</span></span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Other verses will usually make clear that Jesus was a male child. If you use a phrase such as “the male child of God,” be sure that it does not imply that God had another child who was female.</p><h4>4:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as we mature</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to become mature <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span>,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">until</span> we become fully grown/developed <span data-bnType=\"implied\">believers</span></p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as we mature:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>as we mature</em> is literally “to a mature man.” The second goal of the church is to <em>mature</em>. Here, this refers to becoming fully grown, fully developed, like adults in our faith (in contrast to children in 4:14). The meaning is “mature as Christians.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>mature in the Lord (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>4:13d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:13d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to the full measure of the stature of Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and to become completely like Christ, who is perfect.</p></li><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">until</span> we become completely mature/perfect, just like Christ is.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to the full measure of the stature of Christ:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>to the full measure of the stature of Christ</em> is literally “at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.” It means “to become exactly like Christ, who is perfect.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul is using a metaphor here, comparing the physical maturity of children to the spiritual maturity of Christians. Just as a child grows up until he becomes an adult like his parents, so we Christians are to grow up in our faith until we are like Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages people may not understand the meaning of the metaphor. If that is true in your language, consider translating the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and become completely mature, just as Christ is</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>until we measure up to Christ, who is the standard (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grow up and be strong the way Christ is strong</p></blockquote>",

It is a continuation of the figure of speech that Paul used in 4:13. It means “immature,” which is the opposite of “mature” in 4:13b. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>we will no longer be immature like children (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another way to translate this is as a simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>we will no longer be <u>like</u> children</p></blockquote><h4>4:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>tossed about by the waves</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We will no longer be</span> tossed around by the waves.</p></li><li><p>The waves <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will no longer</span> toss us back and forth.</p></li><li><p>who are easily led astray, like a small boat</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and carried around by every wind of teaching</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We will no longer be</span> blown around by every wind of doctrine.</p></li><li><p>The <span data-bnType=\"implied\">new/false</span> teachings/ideas <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> wind <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will no longer</span> blow us here and there.</p></li><li><p>that is sent in different directions by the waves and wind.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:14b–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching:</strong> There are at least two issues you must consider as you translate 4:14b–c.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1—passives:</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">There are several passives in 4:14b–c. If it would be more natural in your language to use active clauses here, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The waves will no longer toss us about, and every wind of teaching will no longer carry us around.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2—metaphor:</u></p><p data-indent=\"2\">4:14b–c contains another metaphor. Here Paul compared Christians to boats in the water. The NCV makes this explicit when it says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>We will not be tossed about <u>like a ship</u> that the waves carry one way and then another. (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The waves and wind easily push boats off course. In the same way, cunning men easily deceive weak Christians and “push” them away from true doctrine.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In translating this metaphor, you have several possibilities:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>You may want to translate this as a simile:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">We will no longer be like boats</span> that the waves toss back and forth and the wind blows here and there.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>You may want to translate the direct meaning of the metaphor. If you live in a place where boats and travelling on the water are unknown, people who read your translation may be confused by this figure of speech. If that is true, you may need to translate the meaning with no figure of speech:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14c</sup>Cunning men will no longer easily deceive us <sup>14b</sup>to believe false teaching.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Or you may need to use another figure of speech, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>We will no longer be like dry leaves that the wind blows around.</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by every wind of teaching:</strong> The phrase <em>by every wind of teaching</em> means we will no longer be easily deceived “by every type of false teaching.” The word <em>wind</em> is part of the figure of speech that Paul used. The word <em>teaching</em> helps explain the meaning of this figure of speech. Wind easily blows a boat in different directions. In the same way, false teaching easily “blows off course” a weak Christian. That is, it easily causes a weak Christian to leave the truth and follow false teaching.</p><h4>4:14d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:14d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">This means,</span> cunning and tricky people will no longer deceive us with their false teaching.</p></li><li><p>We will no longer be influenced by people who use cunning and clever strategies to lead us astray. (GW)</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming:</strong> The phrase <em>by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming</em> is also a passive. If it would be more natural in your language to translate this as an active clause, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Cunning and crafty men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will no longer</span> deceive us with their scheming.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>clever cunning of men:</strong> The two words <em>clever</em> and <em>cunning</em> may be treated as a doublet. Together they add emphasis. Both words indicate men who “deceive” or who “trick” people. Some versions translate this phrase like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>deceitful people (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>deceitful scheming:</strong> The phrase <em>deceitful scheming</em> refers to working in an underhanded, lying way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>tricks (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul used these words to emphasize his point. The meaning is similar to “clever” and “cunning.”</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:14b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The clever and cunning men in 4:14d are the ones who do the false teaching mentioned in 4:14c, so in some languages, it will be more natural to put 4:14d before 4:14b–c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>14d</sup>Clever and cunning men <span data-bnType=\"implied\">will no longer be able to</span> deceive us with their false teaching. <sup>14b–c</sup>This teaching tries to toss us back and forth <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like boats</span> on the waves or <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like boats</span> blown here and there by the wind.</p></blockquote></div>",

In this section, Paul showed how those truths should affect the way we live. He urged the Ephesian Christians to behave in the way that would keep their unity. He explained in detail the basis of this unity. He also explained that Christ gives believers power to do different tasks so that the church may become strong and mature. Mature believers should no longer be influenced by false teaching. Instead, they will proclaim the truth, and the church, with Christ as its head, will grow as it should and become strong.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Unity of the body of Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ’s gifts to the church</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live in unity, using God’s gifting to strengthen believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul urges the Ephesians to live a life of unity in Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Believers in Christ should live in unity, strengthening each other</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050004007\" data-endVerseId=\"1050004016\"><h3>Paragraph 4:7–16</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In 4:4–6 Paul talked about the things that unite Christians. These are things that we have in common. But in 4:7 he talked about special abilities that some Christians have and that others do not have. We <u>all</u> have the <u>same</u> Spirit, we <u>all</u> worship the <u>same</u> Lord, and so on. <u>But</u> to <u>each</u> of us, Christ has given different special abilities.</p></div><h4>4:16a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>From Him the whole body,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He/Christ joins together all his people;</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">and all of us who believe</span> in him <span data-bnType=\"implied\">are like his body</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>From Him:</strong> The pronoun <em>Him</em> refers to Christ in 4:15b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the whole body:</strong> Paul again used the picture of a <em>body</em> to describe the church. Just as the ligaments/muscles hold together the different parts of the body, so it is Christ who holds together his body, which is the church (all believers).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He makes the whole body (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The whole body depends on Christ (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Like the whole body depends <span data-bnType=\"implied\">on the head</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">so all we believers depend</span> on Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated <em>body</em> in 4:4a and 4:12b.</p><h4>4:16b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>fitted and held together by every supporting ligament,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that we are like the ligaments that join together all the parts of the body of a person.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Just as</span> a person’s body is joined together by all its ligaments,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>fitted and held together:</strong> The phrase <em>fitted and held together</em> refers to the different parts of the body of Christ (members of the church) that work together just as the different parts of a body are held together by its ligaments/muscles. See the note below on “ligament” for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by every supporting ligament:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>by every supporting ligament</em> is literally “through every joint of the supply.” A <em>ligament</em> refers to one of the strong bands of tough fibrous tissue that joins bones or holds some part of the body in position. In this context, the word <em>ligament</em> includes all those things that connect the different parts of the body together, that is, joints, tendons and muscles.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 4:16a:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He makes the whole body fit together and unites it through the support of every joint (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If the people will not understand that this is a metaphor about the group of believers then you may want to translate the meaning directly. Here is an example of how to translate the meaning directly:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>He causes all the believers to work together harmoniously as they support each other.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Another option is to put in a footnote. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Paul is continuing to use a metaphor here. He compares the ligaments of a person’s body that holds the body together to the individual believers helping and supporting each other by Christ’s power. The following is an example of the metaphor with its meaning. “As God causes the whole body to be held together by its ligaments so Christ causes all his believers to work together harmoniously by their support of each other.”</p></blockquote><h4>4:16c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:16c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>grows and builds itself up in love through the work of each individual part.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>If each part <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the body</span> does its work, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">then the whole body</span> grows and becomes strong and loves the other parts.</p></li><li><p>and, when every part <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the body</span> works properly, it grows and becomes strong; <span data-bnType=\"implied\">in the same way, if each of us does the work Christ has given us, we will grow strong and mature</span> and love each other more.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>grows and builds itself up:</strong> The phrase <em>grows and builds itself up</em> means “cause to grow large and strong” or “make complete and mature.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>grows and becomes strong (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in love:</strong> The phrase <em>in love</em> means that the members of the body will grow in their love for each other. This phrase also occurred in 4:15a.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the work of each individual part:</strong> This is a continuation of Paul’s comparison between a human body and the church. If all the parts of a person’s body function as they should, the body will be healthy and grow. So it is with the church: if all believers use the special gifts God has given them, then the church will become strong. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>As each and every part does its job (GW)</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:16c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In your translation it may be better to reorder this clause. You could first explain the figure of speech (“If each part of a body does its work…”) and then explain how believers are compared to the body (“In the same way…”). This has been done in the second meaning line of the Display for 4:16c.</p><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:16a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is another way to translate this verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He would be like our head, and we would be each of his arms, legs and sinews/ligaments.

Some English versions repeat the verb “You were taught…” (from 4:21a) at the beginning of 4:22. The BSB does not do this, but continues the sentence on from 4:21b. If, in your translation, you follow the example of those English versions that begin a new sentence here (like the NIV), you may also want to repeat “You were taught…” at the beginning of 4:23.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is another way to translate 4:22–24 is as a direct command:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(4:22a) Stop behaving like you used to…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>(4:24a) Let God make you a new person</p></blockquote><h4>4:22a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>to put off your former way of life,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">Your teachers</span> taught you</p></li><li><p>This is what you were taught:</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:22b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>your old self,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>to leave/abandon the way you used to behave.</p></li><li><p>Stop behaving as you previously did.</p></li></ul></div><h4>4:22a–b</h4><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to put off your former way of life, your old self:</strong> The phrase <em>your former way of life</em> means “the way you used to live” or “the way you previously behaved <span data-bnType=\"implied\">when you did not yet know Christ</span>.” The clause <em>your old self</em> is a figure of speech. It means “your former character” or “the behavior you used to do.” This is contrasted with “your new self” in 4:24.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The words <em>put off</em> in 4:22a and “put on” in 4:24 are words usually used to mean take off and put on clothes. A person can take off old, dirty clothes and put on new, clean clothes. In the same way, the Ephesian Christians should “take off” (stop doing) the dirty behavior they used to do, and “put on” (start doing) clean, Christian behavior.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>your old self:</strong> The phrase <em>your old self</em> refers to “your former/previous character” or “the way you used to behave.” Paul was telling the Ephesians to no longer live the way they did before they became Christians. When a person becomes a Christian, it is as if he becomes a new person (see 2 Corinthians 5:17).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In translating this clause, it may be necessary to translate this figure of speech directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>change the way you were living (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>give up your old way of life (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>4:22c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:22c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Your evil desires deceived you and spoiled/ruined your lives.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">At that time,</span> you desired to do <span data-bnType=\"implied\">all kinds of</span> evil things. Those things were leading you astray and were destroying your life.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which is being corrupted:</strong> The word <em>which</em> refers back to “old self” in 4:22b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>is being corrupted:</strong> The word <em>corrupted</em> can mean to “rot away,” “decay,” “ruin” or “destroy.” To say that a person is <em>being corrupted</em> means he is becoming controlled by evil, until finally he is destroyed. He is like a tree that gets more and more rotten on the inside until it dies and is destroyed.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being destroyed (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>being ruined</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>by its deceitful desires:</strong> The phrase <em>deceitful desires</em> refers to evil things the Ephesians wanted to do that led them away from the truth/Christ. In many languages it will probably be clearer to translate <em>deceitful</em> and <em>desires</em> as verbs, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You <u>desired</u> to do evil things, and these things <u>deceived</u> you.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul meant that the evil desires in people’s hearts caused them to believe the wrong things and follow their own way instead of following God’s way. 4:22c can be translated:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The things you wanted to do were wrong and deceived you, and so they ruined/spoiled your hearts.</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 4:22a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">You may want to translate 4:22c as a new sentence.

It means to “start behaving like the new person God made you to be (when you became a Christian).” Just like a person puts on new, clean clothes, so we are to start living a new, clean life.

The SSA considers this phrase to state the ways in which the new man is to be like God. He is to be truly righteous and truly holy. A good model to follow is the NCV which says:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><sup>24a</sup>That new person is made to be like God—<sup>24b</sup>made to be truly good and holy (NCV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The second issue to decide is how the word <em>true</em> is connected to righteousness and holiness. A literal English translation of the Greek text is “in righteousness and holiness of the truth.” Scholars differ about how to connect “truth” to <em>righteousness and holiness</em>. Some of the main alternatives are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Truth goes with both righteousness and holiness. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>truly righteous and holy (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NLT, GW, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Truth goes with only holiness. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in righteousness and true holiness (KJV) <em>(CEV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Truth is the source of righteousness and holiness. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>in righteousness and holiness that comes from truth (NET) <em>(NET, UBS)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the majority of English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In many languages it will not be clear to translate the phrase <em>in true righteousness and holiness</em> literally. It may be best to begin a new sentence instead. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Your behavior should be truly righteous and holy.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness and holiness:</strong> The words <em>righteousness</em> and <em>holiness</em> are very similar in meaning.

Use the form here that you use for other Old Testament quotations in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">You may also want to add a footnote stating that this is a quotation from Psalm 4:4. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In this verse Paul quotes Psalm 4:4.

But we need to be careful, because it is easy to sin when we are angry.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>yet do not sin:</strong> The word <em>sin</em> refers to an offense against God. Sin includes an act, thought, and attitude that is not what God wants or approves of. A person can also offend God by not doing what God wants him to do.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is helpful to translate <em>sin</em> with a general term that can include any offense against God. Here are some problems to avoid:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The term should not imply that only serious crimes like murder or stealing are sins. Other offenses like gossip and greed are also sins.</p></li><li><p>The term should not include accidents or mistakes that are not against God’s will.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Some ways to translate <em>sin</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>wrong act</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>offense <span data-bnType=\"implied\">against God</span></p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>evil deed</p></blockquote><h4>4:26b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:26b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Do not let the sun set upon your anger,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Before the end of the day you must stop being angry.</p></li><li><p>Do not stay angry after sunset.</p></li><li><p>Do not be angry for more than a day,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Do not let the sun set upon your anger:</strong> Paul is using figurative language here.

Instead they must be kind, tender and forgiving.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Live as God’s people (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The old life and the new life (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Don’t live as pagans but as God’s people</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050004029\" data-endVerseId=\"1050004032\"><h3>Paragraph 4:29–32</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul gave additional commands about proper Christian behavior for the Ephesians.

This metaphor is about the Holy Spirit. In both passages, Paul said that God sealed us with the Holy Spirit. This shows that we belong to God.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In 1:14a Paul also added that the Holy Spirit is like a deposit or guarantee that one day God will redeem us. The idea of a guarantee is not explicit in 4:30, but some translations make it explicit to make the verse more clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>a guarantee that the Day will come when God will set you free (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">See below under 4:30c for other examples of this.</p><h4>4:30a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"4:30a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not cause the Holy Spirit of God to be sad.</p></li><li><p>Take care that you do not cause the Holy Spirit sorrow.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>And do not grieve:</strong> The word <em>grieve</em> means “to sadden,” “to cause sorrow” or “to cause grief or emotional pain.” Some other ways <em>grieve</em> has been translated include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>make sad (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>bring sorrow to (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the Holy Spirit of God:</strong> See how you translated <em>Holy Spirit</em> 1:13e.

If it would be more natural in your language to make it active, you can say: “God sealed you in/with his Holy Spirit.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sealed:</strong> In NT times, a seal was the personal sign of an owner showing that something marked with a person’s seal belonged to him.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>tribal mark/sign</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>mark (put on animals) to show ownership</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use a simile.

So it is not necessary to start a new section here. One reason to start a new section here is to help the reader, as the previous section is already long. Some English versions begin a new section at 5:1 (BSB, GNT, NLT, NET, GW, NCV, ESV, NASB, NKJV), and some do not (NIV, RSV, NRSV, NJB, CEV, REB, KJV). You may want to consult your national translation and follow their example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul exhorted the Christians to imitate God and avoid the sins of the pagan people surrounding them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Living in the light (GNT, NLT, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Imitate God (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:1a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:1a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Be imitators of God, therefore,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Therefore, imitate God,</p></li><li><p>¶ So in conclusion behave like God,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Be imitators of God:</strong> The word “imitate” means “to copy the behavior, appearance, or speech, of another person.” People who are <em>imitators of God</em> are those who “behave in the same way as God.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>try to be like God (GNT, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do as God does (CEV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>therefore:</strong> The conjunction <em>therefore</em> links 4:32 to 5:1 as an expanded conclusion.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>he loves us</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>gave Himself up for us:</strong> The phrase <em>gave Himself up for us</em> refers to Christ willingly dying on the cross for us.

Priests burned sacrifices to God, and the smell of the smoke was fragrant/sweet and pleased God. In the same way, Christ gave himself as a sacrifice to die to redeem mankind, and what he did pleased God.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It may be clearer for your translation to translate this metaphor as a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it was like a fragrant offering to God which pleased him</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fragrant:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>fragrant</em> is literally “sweet-smelling.” It also implies that Christ’s sacrifice on the cross was pleasing to God. One model to follow here is the GNT that has translated <em>fragrant</em> with both meanings:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice that pleases God (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>sacrificial offering:</strong> The words <em>offering</em> and <em>sacrificial</em> are similar in meaning and in this verse can be treated as a doublet. This means that you can translate both words by one term in your language.

It can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>There should not even be a reason for <u>rumors</u> or gossip that the Ephesians committed these sins. In other words, Christians should have such pure behavior that it will never cause non-Christians to even talk about Christians doing these kinds of sins. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>don’t let it be said that any of you are immoral (CEV) <em>(BSB, NIV, CEV, UBS, SSA)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>These sins should not be <u>mentioned</u> by the Ephesians. This means that Christians themselves should not even talk about such sins in their conversation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>don’t even talk about such things (JBP) <em>(GNT, NRSV, REB, GW, ESV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>These sins should not <u>occur</u> among Christians. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Such sins have no place among God’s people. (NLT) <em>(NET, NLT, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul is urging the Ephesians to keep themselves far away from this sort of sinful behavior. Since Paul is himself, discussing and warning the Ephesians against these sins, (2) seems unlikely. It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), but (3) is also acceptable.</p><h4>5:3a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:3a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>But among you, as is proper among the saints,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>But, because these <span data-bnType=\"implied\">things</span> are not proper for God’s holy people,</p></li><li><p>Now, because it is not right/appropriate for God’s holy people to do these things,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as is proper:</strong> The word <em>proper</em> means “suitable.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>right (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>it should be</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>among the saints:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>saints</em> is literally “holy ones.” It means “people set apart for God.” This Greek word refers to every believer. It can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>people who belong to God</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Many English versions translate this word as <em>saints</em>. All Christians are <em>saints</em>. This word does not refer only to special people that the modern church regards as “saints.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">See how you translated the similar phrase “saints” in 4:12a.

It includes adultery and all sexual relations outside of marriage. Another way this phrase has been translated is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>sexual sin (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:3c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:3c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>or of any kind of impurity, or of greed.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>or perverted, or greedy,</p></li><li><p>Do not do anything shameful/perverted.

In the New Testament, this word is often used together with “sexual immorality.” (See Galatians 5:19 and Colossians 3:5.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your language, there may not be two different words that mean exactly the same things as “sexual immorality” and <em>impurity</em>. But you can probably find ways to talk about the same things. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>adultery and other kinds of sleeping around</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>taking a woman who is not your wife or other unacceptable actions like that</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Try to make your translation clear, but do not use coarse words that are not appropriate to read in public.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>greed:</strong> The word <em>greed</em> refers to a never-ending desire to get more than you have or deserve. While it is usually associated with material gain, in this context, it could also refer to a strong desire for sexual pleasure.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Your translation of <em>greed</em> should allow for a general understanding of the word.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:3a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it will be more natural to reorder parts of 5:3.

Other versions, such as the NIV, use dashes. The dashes or parentheses show that this clause comes in the middle of the main thought.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it is not natural to have a clause like this in the middle of the main sentence. If this is the case in your language, see the General Comment below after 5:5d for other places to put this clause.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>(that is, an idolater):</strong> There are two main ways to connect the word <em>idolater</em> to the preceding part of the verse.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It is connected only to the word <u>greedy</u>. The GNT clearly shows this interpretation by saying:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for greed is a form of idolatry (GNT) <em>(BSB, GNT, REB, GW, NLT, JBP, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It is connected to all three words <u>immoral</u>, <u>impure</u> and <u>greedy</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Being greedy, indecent, or immoral is just another way of worshiping idols. (CEV) <em>(NET, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as it has the most support among commentators and English versions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>idolater:</strong> An <em>idolater</em> is someone who worships idols. A greedy person is like an <em>idolater</em> because riches have become his god. It is as if he worships riches or possessions.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If it is difficult in your language to talk about idols or idolaters together with greed, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People who desire to get many possessions—we can say that they worship those possessions <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead of God</span>.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People who desire to get many possessions have made possessions their lord/boss <span data-bnType=\"implied\">instead of God</span>.</p></blockquote><h4>5:5d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:5d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>will inherit/obtain the good things of the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p></li><li><p>will have a share in the things that Christ and God give to those they rule.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>has any inheritance in:</strong> Here Paul used the Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>inheritance</em> in a figurative sense. Inheritance literally refers to the money or property that someone receives when a relative dies. In its figurative sense, <em>inheritance</em> refers to all the good things that God has promised to give his people. It includes salvation and a future life in heaven. (This word also occurs in 1:14a.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">When Paul said that none of these people “has any inheritance in the kingdom…of God,” he meant that none of them will receive the blessings that God will give his people in his kingdom. These people will have no share in God’s kingdom. They will not be members of it or have a part in it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will never be part of (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>will ever receive a share in (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the kingdom of Christ and of God:</strong> The phrase <em>kingdom of Christ and of God</em> refers to Christ and God’s activity of ruling and caring for his people as their king. It does not refer to a land or country that they rule over. In the Gospels, it is normally referred to as the “kingdom of God.” It refers to the relationship that he has with his people. He leads, protects, and cares for them. They obey, trust, and submit to him as their king.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the people whom Christ and God rule</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You will probably want to translate <em>kingdom of…God</em> here in the same way you translated it in the Gospels, for example in Mark 10:25. (For a discussion of the meaning of <em>kingdom of…God</em>, see kingdom in the Glossary.)<span data-bnType=\"footnote\"><span>The phrase “kingdom of God” is used many times in the NT. But Ephesians 5:5 is the only place in the Bible where the phrase “kingdom of Christ and of God” is used. (But Revelation 11:15 has a similar phrase: “the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.”) If you translate “kingdom” as a noun, make sure it is clear in your translation that there are not two kingdoms: (the kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of God) but only one kingdom. You can translate it “the kingdom where Christ and God rule,” or “when God and Christ rule.”</span></span></p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:5a–d</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder the parts of 5:5.

In this context it refers to excusing the sinful behavior listed by Paul in 5:3–5.

So it is not necessary to start a new section here. One reason to start a new section here is to help the reader, as the previous section is already long. Some English versions begin a new section at 5:1 (BSB, GNT, NLT, NET, GW, NCV, ESV, NASB, NKJV), and some do not (NIV, RSV, NRSV, NJB, CEV, REB, KJV). You may want to consult your national translation and follow their example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul exhorted the Christians to imitate God and avoid the sins of the pagan people surrounding them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Living in the light (GNT, NLT, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Imitate God (GW)</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050005006\" data-endVerseId=\"1050005014\"><h3>Paragraph 5:6–14</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions begin a new paragraph at 5:6. Others begin a new paragraph at 5:8.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul used the words “darkness” and “light” in a metaphorical sense. These words will be discussed further below.</p></div><h4>5:9</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:9\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Because light produces/makes everything that is good and right and true.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say this because</span> if people have the light <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the truth</span>, the result is that they behave in good, upright and honest ways.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\">In some English versions, verse 5:9 is marked by parentheses; that is, it is an extra thought added in between “walk as children of light” (5:8b) and “test and prove what pleases the Lord” (5:10). You could show this by starting the verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>I say this because….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">If you rearranged 5:5c you may want to rearrange this verse in the same way. If not, consider following the example of the BSB and set this verse apart with a comma. Or, you could use parentheses, as some English versions do (see the NIV).</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for the fruit of the light:</strong> The phrase <em>the fruit of the light</em> contains two metaphors. Paul continues to use the metaphor of “light” introduced in 5:8b–c. Here in 5:9 he is introducing the metaphor of <em>fruit of the light</em>. Light is compared to a plant or a field that produces a harvest (fruit). Just as a plant produces fruit, so also spiritual light produces spiritual fruit: goodness, righteousness and truth.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be necessary to drop the metaphor of fruit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">So here are some ways to translate this without using the metaphor of fruit:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true. (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>-or-If people live in the light, the result is that they behave in good, upright and honest ways.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>The light <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of the truth</span> causes people to do good and upright and true things.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth:</strong> These are the qualities or kinds of behavior that people who are in the light (that is, Christians) should have.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>goodness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>goodness</em> means being good, kind and generous. In some languages it may not be natural to use nouns for qualities such as <em>goodness</em>. In that case it may be more natural to use a verb to express this idea. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>to do good things</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be good</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To act kindly</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>righteousness</em> means being upright, moral, doing things that please God (see 4:24b).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways <em>righteousness</em> may be translated here include:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>honest (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>(everything) that has God’s approval (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>live a straight life</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See righteous in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>truth:</strong> The word <em>truth</em> in this verse means “to behave in an honest, sincere manner.” It is not referring to something that is true and not false.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:9</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to translate all three of these nouns (“goodness,” “righteousness,” and “truth”) in a form that is not a noun. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The people who walk in the light will bear fruit. They will do good behavior, walk the straight path, and speak the truth.</p></blockquote></div>",

The things they do have no value.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Have no fellowship with:</strong> The clause <em>Have no fellowship with</em> means “Do not participate in…” or “Take no part in….”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">It is also similar in meaning to Paul’s words in 5:7 “do not be partners with” people who do evil. In 5:7, Paul said that the Ephesians should not be included in the group of those who do evil. Here in 5:11, he said that they should not be involved in their deeds.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not participate in (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Take no part in (RSV, NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the fruitless deeds of darkness:</strong> This clause contains two metaphors and is parallel to “fruit of the light” in 5:9.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fruitless deeds:</strong> This refers to worthless, sinful acts. If you dropped the figure of fruit in 5:9, you will probably also have to drop the figure of <em>fruitless</em> here. However, if possible, try to keep the metaphor of darkness in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If in your translation you want to make explicit the people who do the deeds, you could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not join in doing the deeds of people who are in the darkness.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>darkness:</strong> The word <em>darkness</em> is a metaphor. It refers to being disobedient and separated from the will and purposes of God. See how you translated it in 5:8a and translate it the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it may be natural to change the order of these two clauses. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>People who don’t walk in the light don’t bear fruit, stay far away <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from them</span></p></blockquote><h4>5:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but rather expose them.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, bring these sinful deeds into the open/light.</p></li><li><p>Instead, show people that these things/deeds are evil.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but rather:</strong> The phrase <em>but rather</em> introduces a contrast between 5:11a and 5:11b. This is the type of negative-positive contrast, “Don’t do…but instead do…” In 5:11a Paul encouraged the Ephesians to not participate in “the fruitless deeds of darkness.” Now he is exhorting them to show others that the “fruitless deeds of darkness” are evil.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But instead (RSV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>But, on the contrary (NJB)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Instead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>expose them:</strong> Here and in 5:13 (where the context is “light”) the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>expose</em> means, “bring into the open,” or “bring into the light.” When a person says to someone “What you are doing is evil, it is against God’s teaching,” it is like shining a light on his or her evil deeds, thus “exposing” the fruitless deeds.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bring them out to the light (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>show that they are wrong (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>make it clear <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to people</span> that this kind of behavior <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is wrong</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>them:</strong> The pronoun <em>them</em> refers to “the fruitless deeds of darkness.”</p>",

Paul is also further explaining what he meant by “expose them” in 5:11b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The meaning of the figure of speech can be explained like this: “When we shine light on something, people can clearly see what it looks like.

Many other English versions include this verse part at the beginning of verse 14 (see NIV, CEV, ESV, GNT, GW, NABRE, NET, NRSV). It may be best to follow the numbering system that is used in the major version in your area.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself:</strong> Scholars have different views on the meaning of this clause. The meaning depends on whether the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>illuminated</em> has a passive or active meaning:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>The verb has a <u>passive</u> meaning. The clause means that anything that has <u>been revealed</u> (by the light) is light or becomes light. Another way of saying it is: the darkness in things is replaced by the light so the things are transformed into light. The REB has perhaps the clearest translation of this interpretation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>whatever is exposed to the light itself becomes light (REB) <em>(BSB, RSV, GNT, NASB, NJB, REB, NCV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>The verb has an <u>active</u> meaning. The clause means that light <u>reveals/shows</u> what the dark things are really like. This is what light always does. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Light shows up everything (CEV) <em>(NIV, NLT, NET, GW, CEV, ESV, KJV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was thinking of the Ephesian Christians who were in darkness, but were now living in God’s light (5:8). When God’s light shines on the hearts of unbelievers, they stop doing their evil deeds. They come to the light and they become “children of light,” too. Here is one way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>For when the light shines on anything that is dark, that thing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">does not stay dark but</span> becomes light/bright also.</p></blockquote>",

Others begin a new paragraph at 5:8.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul used the words “darkness” and “light” in a metaphorical sense. These words will be discussed further below.</p></div><h4>5:14a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>So it is said:</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And for this reason it says: (NET)</p></li><li><p>That is why people say:</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:14b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>“Wake up, O sleeper, rise up from the dead,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>“You<sup>(sing)</sup> sleeper, wake up, rise up from death,</p></li><li><p>“You<sup>(sing)</sup> who are asleep, wake up! Do not remain dead from your sins, become alive!</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:14c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:14c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and Christ will shine on you.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the light of</span> Christ will shine on you<sup>(sing)</sup>.”</p></li><li><p>Then Christ will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">make his light of truth and goodness/righteousness</span> shine in your heart.”</p></li></ul></div><h4>5:14a–c</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">The words in 5:14b–c are probably from an early Christian hymn. It is not a direct quotation from the OT. Paul quoted these words because they speak about the same things he has just said: we must expose the evil deeds of people so they will come to the light.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>So it is said:</strong> This is a passive clause. If you need to translate this with an active verb, you can translate it as “people say.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is why <span data-bnType=\"implied\">people</span> say:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>This is the reason <span data-bnType=\"implied\">there is a song/poem</span> with these words:</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>And so there is a saying which sounds like this:</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">In the words that Paul quotes, there are three metaphors for turning to God:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>waking from sleep,</p></li><li><p>being raised from death,</p></li><li><p>going from darkness into light.</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">You should try to translate all three of these metaphors as literally as possible. Add only as much of the implicit meaning as is necessary.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Wake up, O sleeper:</strong> The clause <em>Wake up, O sleeper</em> is a metaphor. The meaning of this metaphor is: “You are like a person who is asleep, because you are not aware of your sins. Become aware of your sins!”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>O sleeper:</strong> The word <em>O</em> is not in the Greek text, but the BSB and some other English versions have included it. It is sometimes used in English poetry to add emphasis to what follows it.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">He is speaking about someone who isn’t aware of his sin and needs to be forgiven. He is not speaking about someone who is actually asleep.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some other ways to translate this phrase are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Get up you sleeping ones!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You who are asleep, wake up!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If people would think that this is speaking of a person who is actually asleep then you may want to add some of the meaning in the text to make the meaning clear. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You who are asleep <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spiritually</span>, wake up!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You who are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> a sleeping person, Get up!</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>You who are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">unaware of your sins are like a person who is</span> asleep. Wake up!</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>rise up from the dead:</strong> The clause <em>rise up from the dead</em> is also a metaphor. The meaning of this metaphor is: “You are like a person who is dead, because you are separated from God and do not have the new life that God gives. Come to God and get this new life!” (In 2:1 Paul also used the word “dead” as a metaphor.) He is not speaking to people who are literally dead.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages a literal translation of this metaphor may be difficult to understand.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You who are <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> dead people, rise up!</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Change the metaphor to a simile and make explicit the meaning. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You who are separated from God like dead people, rise up and be saved</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Translate the meaning without the figure of speech. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You who are separated from God, be saved</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You who do not know God, accept Him!</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and Christ will shine on you:</strong> The Greek clause that the BSB translates as <em>Christ will shine on you</em> is yet another metaphor. Christ is like the sun. The idea is that Christ’s goodness and truth will be given to them (shine on them) giving them new life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ will <span data-bnType=\"implied\">make his light</span> shine in your heart.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…<span data-bnType=\"implied\">the light of</span> Christ will shine on you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ will give his light <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of truth and goodness</span> to you <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and change you</span>.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>and:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>and</em> here introduces a result of doing what 14b says.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">If you do these things,</span> <u>then as a result</u> Christ will shine on you.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>As a result <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of doing this</span> Christ will give you his light <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of truth and goodness</span></p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:14b–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">The person being spoken to in 5:14b–c (“Wake up, O sleeper…”) is an unbeliever. In the Greek, the commands in 5:14b and the “you” in 5:14c are singular, as if one person is being spoken to. But these words are good for all people who are still “in the darkness.” If it is more natural in your language, you can translate these words as plural:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wake up, O sleepers…Christ will shine on you<sup>(plur)</sup>.</p></blockquote></div>",

Paul is giving a warning to his audience about how they should live their lives.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>then:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>then</em> is a logical connector that introduces an appeal based on what he has said in the earlier part of chapter 5. This word is not a time word. It can be translated as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>therefore (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>so then (GW)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>walk:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB literally translates as <em>walk</em> means “to behave or live.” See the notes on “walk” in 2:2a, 2:10c, 4:1b and 5:8c.</p><h4>5:15b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:15b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>not as unwise but as wise,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not behave like foolish people; instead, behave wisely.</p></li><li><p>Behave wisely rather than foolishly.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>unwise…wise:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>wise</em> refers to the ability to understand what happens and decide on the right action.

His main point is not whether it is wine or beer or something else that we drink that causes us to get drunk. (Note also that Paul did not forbid his readers to drink any wine at all. Wine was a common drink in Paul’s time.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, it might be better to say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not drink intoxicating drinks to get drunk</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>don’t give your heart to getting drunk</p></blockquote><h4>5:18b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:18b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>which leads to reckless indiscretion.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because getting drunk</span> causes people to behave in a wild, uncontrolled way.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">because</span> then you will indulge in shameless immorality.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>which leads to reckless indiscretion:</strong> Paul is explaining here why believers should not get drunk.

You may want to consult your national translation and follow their example.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">In this section, Paul exhorted the Christians to imitate God and avoid the sins of the pagan people surrounding them.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Living in the light (GNT, NLT, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Imitate God (GW)</p></blockquote></div><h4>5:19–21</h4><p data-indent=\"1\">In 5:18 Paul gave the command “be filled with the Spirit.” In the Greek text, this sentence does not end at 5:18, but continues until 5:21. The BSB and some other versions begin a new sentence here. You must decide whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here or to translate 5:19a as a continuation of 5:18c. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making music to the Lord in your hearts (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\">In 5:19–21, Paul lists four kinds of good behavior that we should do when we are “filled” (controlled) by the Holy Spirit. We should:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>encourage one another with songs,</p></li><li><p>sing to praise the Lord,</p></li><li><p>give thanks and</p></li><li><p>submit to one another.</p></li></ol><h4>5:19a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Sing<sup>(plur)</sup> psalms, hymns and other spiritual songs to one another.</p></li><li><p>Sing<sup>(plur)</sup> to one another songs that David wrote and other songs of praise.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Speak to one another:</strong> People normally “sing” psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. They generally do not <em>Speak</em> them. So when Paul said <em>Speak to one another</em>, he could have meant:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>sing</u> songs to one another. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves <em>(NRSV, NLT, CEV, NJB, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>speak or <u>recite</u> the words of these songs to one another. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>by reciting psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for your own good <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NET, NASB, REB, KJV, NCV, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1), as this seems to fit the context better and has more commentary support. See also Colossians 3:16 where Paul used the verb “sing” in a similar context.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs:</strong> Paul here mentioned three types of songs. (Compare this phrase with Colossians 3:16.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>psalms:</strong> The word <em>psalms</em> refers to the psalms in the Old Testament. King David wrote most of these songs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>hymns:</strong> These <em>hymns</em> were in honor of God and Jesus. The early Christians wrote these songs.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>spiritual songs:</strong> Scholars are not certain of the meaning of <em>spiritual songs</em>. These songs may have been spontaneous singing inspired by the Holy Spirit.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If you do not have three different terms, use short, descriptive phrases to translate these terms. You could combine two of the terms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>songs of David and other songs praising God</p></blockquote><h4>5:19b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:19b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Sing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">songs</span> and make <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> music to the Lord with all your<sup>(plur)</sup> heart.</p></li><li><p>Praise the Lord by singing and making music heartily/enthusiastically.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Sing and make music:</strong> The verb <em>Sing</em> obviously means with the voice. So the clause <em>make music</em> may indicate other types of music, for example, playing instruments. However, this clause should remain generic in the translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Sing <span data-bnType=\"implied\">songs</span> and make <span data-bnType=\"implied\">other</span> music</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Singing and making melody (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in your hearts:</strong> There are at least two ways to understand the phrase <em>in your hearts</em>:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means sing <u>with all your hearts</u>, in other words, sing with enthusiasm. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…as you praise the Lord with all your heart. <em>(RSV, NASB, ESV, GW, REB, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means literally sing <u>in your heart</u>. This would mean singing privately in your own heart without making any sound. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…making music in your hearts for the ears of the Lord! <em>(BSB, NIV, GNT, NRSV, NET, NLT, JBP, NJB, KJV, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This fits the prior clause well, since Paul was writing about public singing.</p>",

For the next three sections, Paul taught about how Christians should behave in their relationships in their families and at work. In this first section, he dealt with the duties of wives and husbands. He described the marriage relationship as a picture of the relationship between Christ and the church.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s advise to wives and husbands (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How a wife and a husband should live together</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050005021\" data-endVerseId=\"1050005024\"><h3>Paragraph 5:21–24</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">Some English versions make verse 5:21 part of the previous section, and begin this section with 5:22. However, since Paul began to talk about a new topic—submitting—in 5:21, other versions make 5:21 the beginning of a new section.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">You may want to consult your national version and use it as a model to follow.</p></div><h4>5:23a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>For the husband is the head of the wife</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>For the husband is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the head of his wife,</p></li><li><p>Because the husband is the chief/leader of his wife,</p></li><li><p>For the husband has authority over his wife,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>For:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>For</em> introduces the reason that wives are to submit to their husbands (5:22). In some languages, it may be more natural to reorder 5:22 and 5:23. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><sup>23a</sup>The husband is the head of the wife…. That is the reason why <sup>22</sup>wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the husband is the head of the wife:</strong> The word <em>head</em> is a metaphor here, as in other places in Ephesians. This means that the husband is the “leader” or “chief” of the wife, or he has authority over the wife. Some languages use the word <em>head</em> in this sense. For example, the village chief may be called the “head of the village.” But in many languages, it is confusing or means little to say, <em>the husband is the head of the wife</em>. If it will make the meaning clearer in your language, you could translate it:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>A husband is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the head, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">for he has authority</span> over his wife.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>It is the husband who has authority over the wife.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">The full meaning of the metaphor can be explained like this: “In a human body, the part on top that rules the body is the head. In the same way, the husband is like the head, because he has authority over his wife.” But you will probably not want to make all of this explicit in your translation.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, you cannot say “<u>the</u> husband” or “<u>the</u> wife,” these words must take a possessive form:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>her</u> husband</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><u>his</u> wife</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>a woman’s husband</p></blockquote><h4>5:23b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>as Christ is the head of the church, His body,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as Christ is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> the head of the church, and the church is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> his body.</p></li><li><p>as Christ is the chief/leader of the church, and the church is <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> his body.</p></li><li><p>just as Christ has authority over the church.

Just as in our human body the head is the part that is on top and that rules the rest of our body, so also Christ rules over the church, that is, his people.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">If the people in your area would not understand this comparison, you can translate it as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ is the leader of the church, which belongs to Him.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This metaphor (Christ is the head, the church is His body) is also found in 1:22–23, 4:12, 4:15–16 and 5:30. You will want to translate it in a similar way in all these places.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>the church:</strong> The <em>church</em> is the group of all believers in Christ throughout the world. In the New Testament, the word church does not refer to a building. See how you translated <em>church</em> in 1:22b, 3:10a, 3:21b. Also see church in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>His body:</strong> The phrase <em>His body</em> refers to the church. See how you translated this metaphor in 1:23a and 4:4a, 4:12b, and 4:16a.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this metaphor:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his people are like a body</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his people who are united to him like his body is united to his head</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>those who belong to him</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>his people/disciples/followers</p></blockquote><h4>5:23c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:23c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>of which He is the Savior.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>And it is he who saves it.</p></li><li><p>And Christ is the one who has rescued <span data-bnType=\"implied\">us, his people</span> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from our sins</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>of which He is the Savior:</strong> The Greek text that the BSB translates as <em>of which He is the Savior</em> is literally “and he-himself <span data-bnType=\"implied\">is</span> the savior of the body.” This refers to Christ only, and not to husbands. You may want to make this clear in your translation. One way to do this is to make this clause a separate sentence in your translation:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is the Savior</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christ is the one who saves his people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This same Christ rescues his people <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from their sins</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See save, Word 3 in the Glossary for more information.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:23a–b</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other ways to translate this verse:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>The husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church.

There are two possible ways to interpret the meaning of the Greek verb here.</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>It means <u>to make holy/pure</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>to make her holy (NLT) <em>(BSB, NIV, NRSV, NJB, GW, NLT, CEV, JBP)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means “<u>to set apart</u>, <u>to make God’s special people</u>.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He did this to dedicate the church to God (GNT) <em>(GNT, REB, NCV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). In the NT, <em>sanctify</em> usually means “set apart for the service of God,” but here the meaning is “made pure” because of the word “cleansing” which follows. You can translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this</span> to make them pure</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See holy, Meaning 4 in the Glossary for more information.</p><h4>5:26b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:26b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>He cleaned the church <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span> with God’s word and by washing it with water.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">When we heard</span> God’s word <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and believed</span>, he cleaned/washed us <span data-bnType=\"implied\">from sin</span> with the water <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of baptism</span>.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>cleansing her by the washing with water:</strong> The clause <em>cleansing her by the washing with water</em> is a metaphor. Paul meant that Christ “washed away” or removed our sins (cf. 1 John 1:7, 9). It is another way to say Christ made us holy (5:26a). Paul was not referring to Christ literally washing the church or Christians to get the dirt off their bodies.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>by the washing with water:</strong> Paul said that Christ removed our sins <em>by the washing with water</em>. This probably refers to baptism. Paul may have been comparing baptism to the ceremonial bath taken by a Jewish bride before marriage. Just as a Jewish bride was given a bath before her marriage, so Christ washed away our sins through baptism when we became his bride.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In order to avoid implying that Christ physically washed the church, you may need to include your word for “baptism” in your translation. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>…to make her holy and clean, washed by baptism and God’s Word (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">(In the above quote from the NLT96, the word “her” refers to the church.)</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>through the word:</strong> There are two interpretation issues that you need to consider when you translate this phrase:</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 1</u>: The meaning of the phrase <em>the word</em>. Here <em>the word</em> means the words that God or Christ spoke. It refers to God’s Word, the Christian message. When we heard and believed God’s Word, trusted in Christ and were baptized, Christ made us pure and cleansed us from sin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><u>Issue 2</u>: To which part of the verse is <em>word</em> connected. Two of the main interpretations are:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><em>word</em> goes with “cleansed.” According to this interpretation, Christ cleansed the church both with water and with the word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>washed by baptism and God’s word (NLT) <em>(NLT96, GW, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><em>word</em> goes with sanctify/make holy in 5:26a. According to this interpretation, Christ cleansed the church with water, and then he sanctified it by the word. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>dedicate the church to God by his word, after making it clean by washing it in water (GNT)</p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) as this seems to have the most support among commentaries.</p>",

For the next three sections, Paul taught about how Christians should behave in their relationships in their families and at work. In this first section, he dealt with the duties of wives and husbands. He described the marriage relationship as a picture of the relationship between Christ and the church.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s advise to wives and husbands (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>How a wife and a husband should live together</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050005025\" data-endVerseId=\"1050005033\"><h3>Paragraph 5:25–33</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In the previous paragraph Paul talked about the duties that a wife has toward her husband.

He gave himself for the church <u>in order to</u> <em>present her to Himself</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The picture of marriage continues. The church is compared to a beautiful bride. In a Jewish wedding, the groom’s friend brings the bride to meet the groom at the wedding party. Christ is like the husband or groom, and the church is like his bride. Christ is also like the groom’s friend, because he himself will come and take us and bring us to be with himself.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Usually we give something to another person, not to ourselves. But Paul says that Christ died for the church <em>to present her</em> (the church) <u>to himself</u>. Most commentators think that Paul is talking about what will happen when Christ comes back to earth. He will give us (the church) new bodies and set us free from sin and all that is bad. Then he will take us to be with him, and we will be “radiant…holy and blameless.”</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as a glorious church:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>glorious</em> means “beautiful, splendid, radiant.” God will give his people wonderful new life.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate <em>glorious</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>radiant (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in all her beauty (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>church:</strong> The <em>church</em> refers to the group of all believers in Christ throughout the world. See how you translated <em>church</em> in 5:25b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>group of all Christ-believers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Christ’s people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>people who follow Christ</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>community of Christ-followers</p></blockquote><h4>5:27b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:27b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>who will not have any dirt or wrinkles or spots.</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did not want</span> dirt, or wrinkles, or any other defects to be in it,</p></li><li><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">He did this</span> in order that his people/church will have no faults or sins or any other bad things;</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish:</strong> The words <em>stain</em>, <em>wrinkle</em>, and <em>blemish</em> are figures of speech that represent different kinds of faults and sins. Christ does not want any bad thing to be in his church. He compares his church to a beautiful woman wearing beautiful clean clothes who has no dirt or wrinkles on her clothes and no blemishes (ugly spots) on her skin. That is a comparison of how the church will be: beautiful, perfect, with no sins or faults.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stain:</strong> The Greek word that the BSB translates as <em>stain</em> can also be translated as “spot.” It refers to a small dirty area on a cloth, a rug, etc.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this word:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>dirty spot</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>soiled clothes</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>wrinkle:</strong> The word <em>wrinkle</em> refers to a small crease, as in some cloth or one’s skin.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blemish:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>blemish</em> is literally “any such things.” It refers back to “stain” and “wrinkle.” This refers to any defects or imperfections. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>any other imperfection (GNT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">If it would not be natural or clear in your translation to translate the terms “stain,” “wrinkle,” and <em>blemish</em>, you may want to translate the meaning directly. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>have absolutely no fault/lack</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with no evil or sin or any other wrong thing in it (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>nothing evil would be found against them</p></blockquote><h4>5:27c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:27c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>but holy and blameless.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Rather, it will be pure and without fault.</p></li><li><p>but <span data-bnType=\"implied\">he wanted</span> it to be holy and perfect.</p></li><li><p>instead they/we will be pure, and there will be no bad thing in them/us for which he <span data-bnType=\"implied\">or people</span> could condemn them/us.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>but:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>but</em> here marks a contrast between 5:27b and 5:27c. Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this conjunction:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>but rather</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>instead</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>holy and blameless:</strong> These are the same words Paul used to describe believers in 1:4b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>holy:</strong> The word <em>holy</em> here means “pure” or “without sin.” We will be holy/pure, because he made us holy/pure. (In Greek the word “sanctify” in 5:26a is related to the word <em>holy</em> here.)</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate <em>holy</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>pure (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without sin</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See holy, Meaning 2 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>blameless:</strong> The word <em>blameless</em> means that there is nothing bad in a person’s behavior that God (or other people) could accuse the person of doing. Some other ways to translate <em>blameless</em> are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>without fault (NLT, GW, CEV, NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>innocent</p></blockquote><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 5:27a–c</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">In some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of 5:27b–c.

The husbands are to love their wives in the same way as Christ loved the church. If this is not clear in the translation you may want to include the implied information. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p><u>In the same way</u> <span data-bnType=\"implied\">that Christ loved the church</span> so a husband should love his wife.”</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>husbands ought to love their wives:</strong> This means that each husband should love his own wife. In areas where there is polygamy, it may be better to use a singular subject instead of a plural. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>…each man should love his own wife as he loves his own body.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This fits well with the singular verb (loves himself) that follows in 5:28b.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as their own bodies:</strong> These words mean that a husband should love his wife just like he loves his own body. When Paul says that a husband loves his own body, he means that he does things to protect himself from harm. He wants to survive, and so he does what helps him survive and live well. (as mentioned in 5:29a). If it is not natural in your language to talk about loving your body, you can translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>as he loves himself (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>5:28b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:28b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>He who loves his wife loves himself.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>The man who loves his wife loves himself.</p></li><li><p>If a man loves his wife, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">it is like</span> he loves himself.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who loves his wife loves himself:</strong> There is implied information here. Paul is making a comparison by referring back to the metaphor of 5:23: The husband is the head of his wife just as Christ is the head of the church. Using that metaphor, Paul reminds the Ephesians that a husband is united to his wife in the same way that Christ is united to the church. So, figuratively, the wife is the “body” of her husband just as the church is the “body” of Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In translating this sentence, it may be helpful to show that Paul is making a comparison. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>When a man loves his wife, it is like he loves himself too.</p></blockquote>",

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>So a man should leave his father and mother…</p></blockquote></li><li><p>As a general statement about what usually happens:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>This is why a man <span data-bnType=\"implied\">normally</span> leaves his father and mother…</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>leave his father and mother:</strong> You can translate the phrase <em>his father and mother</em> as “his mother and <span data-bnType=\"implied\">his</span> father” or “his parents”—whatever is natural in your language.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>leave his father and mother</em> can be translated “leave his parents’ house.” These words mean that a man’s primary relationship and duty is no longer with his parents, but with his wife. Your translation should not imply that a man should abandon or neglect his parents.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>be united to his wife:</strong> He will form a close and permanent relationship with his wife. He will live with her and they will become a new family, a new household.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and will be joined to his wife (NET)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and he will live with his wife</p></blockquote><h4>5:31b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"5:31b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and the two will become one flesh.”</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and the two of them will become <span data-bnType=\"implied\">like</span> one body.”</p></li><li><p>and the two of them will become as one person.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>the two will become one flesh:</strong> The phrase <em>the two will become one flesh</em> means that the husband and wife will become like one person, or like one body. (Jesus uses this same figure in Matthew 19:4–6.) In God’s sight, it is like a husband and wife are no longer two separate people. It is like they are just one person.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Paul was making a very logical comparison: A husband should love his wife like Christ loves the church (5:25). That is, he should love her like he loves his own body (5:28). The church is part of Christ’s body (5:30), and since a husband and wife are <em>one</em>, (5:31), a wife is like part of the husband’s body.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>one flesh:</strong> Here <em>one flesh</em> means “one person.” In the Greek, it is the same word the BSB translates as “body” in 5:29a.

In this section, Paul talked about another relationship: that of children and parents. Children should obey their parents, and parents should train their children with love and Christian discipline.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s advice to children and parents (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Children should obey their parents</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:4a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath;</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Fathers, do not make your children angry.</p></li><li><p>You fathers, do not treat your children in a harsh way which makes them resentful.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Fathers:</strong> Some versions, for example the GNT and the NJB, translate this as “parents”, referring to both father and mother. But the Greek word here (<em>pater</em>) is different from the word meaning “parents” in 6:1. Therefore, it is better to translate this Greek word as “fathers” in this verse.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>do not provoke your children to wrath:</strong> The Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>provoke…to wrath</em> means “to make angry.” Fathers should not treat their children in a harsh or unjust way that would make them angry or resentful. The tense of the verb in Greek shows that Paul has in mind a continual harsh and critical attitude of a father towards his children, not a sudden outburst of anger.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them (NLT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>don&apos;t make your children bitter about life (GW)</p></blockquote><h4>6:4b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:4b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>instead, bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Instead, raise your children by training and teaching them according to the word of the Lord.</p></li><li><p>Rather, as you raise them, train them and teach them in the way the Lord wants.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>instead:</strong> The Greek conjunction that the BSB translates as <em>instead</em> is literally “but.” It marks a negative-positive contrast between 6:4a and 6:4b (do not do…but instead do…). Translate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Another way to indicate this negative-positive contrast in English is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>but rather</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord:</strong> The phrase <em>bring them up</em> means “raise children” or “rear children.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>in the discipline:</strong> The word <em>discipline</em> refers to the whole process of raising and educating children. Discipline and instruction are part of the training including rules of how to behave.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>instruction:</strong> The word <em>instruction</em> is similar in meaning to “discipline” but focuses more on the ideas of teaching and warning.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>of the Lord:</strong> Fathers must teach their children “as the Lord wants,” “in a way which the Lord approves” or “according to the word of the Lord.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction approved by the Lord. (NLT96)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This phrase probably does not mean that fathers should teach their children “<u>about</u> the Lord” in this context.</p>",

The slave must remember that when he serves his master, he is serving Christ, and he will receive his reward from Christ. The master must remember that the slave’s master in heaven is his own master too.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Paul’s advice to slaves and masters (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Slaves/Servants should obey their masters</p></blockquote></div><h4>6:5a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:5a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Slaves, obey your earthly masters</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>¶ Slaves/servants, obey your masters in this world.</p></li><li><p>¶ <span data-bnType=\"implied\">Now to you who are</span> servants <span data-bnType=\"implied\">I say</span>: do what those who own you<sup>(plur)</sup> tell you to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Slaves:</strong> Paul switched from talking to fathers to talking to slaves in Ephesus who were Christians. In the town of Ephesus, slaves were people who worked in the houses of their masters.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In your translation you should use a natural way to show that Paul began talking to a different group of people. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>To those who are slaves, I say…</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Now you servants….</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>obey:</strong> The word <em>obey</em> means “do what somebody says to do” or “carry out someone’s orders.” For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Slaves, you should do what your masters tell you to do.</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>earthly masters:</strong> The Greek phrase that the BSB translates as <em>earthly masters</em> is literally “masters according to the flesh.” These are in contrast to the master in heaven (6:9). In Greek, the word for “master” and “Lord” is the same word. Paul told slaves to obey their “masters <u>in the flesh</u>” so they would not mistakenly think he meant “obey the Lord” here. See flesh, Meaning 2 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>masters:</strong> The “master” was the person who had bought and who owned the slave.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the word <em>masters</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>owners</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>bosses</p></blockquote><h4>6:5b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:5b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>with respect and fear and sincerity of heart,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Respect<sup>(plur)</sup> them and obey/honour them with all of your heart,</p></li><li><p>Take care to genuinely respect and honour them. Do not just pretend.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>with respect and fear:</strong> The words <em>respect and fear</em> are a doublet. Both words mean respect/honor. (Here fear does not mean “to be afraid of.”) You can translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>respect them and honor/obey them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>really respect them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Perhaps your language has an idiom that describes the attitude a slave should have, for example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>always bow your head to them</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>sincerity of heart:</strong> The phrase <em>sincerity of heart</em> means “honestly,” “with no hidden motives” or “with one heart.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>with a good heart</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Or if it is clearer, you can translate it in a negative way. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not obey them with half a heart</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do not just pretend to respect them</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>be as loyal to them (CEV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:5c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:5c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>just as you would obey Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>as though you were serving Christ.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And you slave masters must treat your slaves right, just as I have told them to treat you. (NLT98)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another possible way to translate this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>treat them well also</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">This does not mean, of course, that masters must <u>obey</u> their slaves in the same way that Paul told slaves to obey their masters in 6:5.</p><h4>6:9b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Give up your use of threats,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>Do not threaten <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to punish</span> them,</p></li><li><p>Do not say, “I will beat you if you do not do your work.”</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Give up your use of threats:</strong> The clause <em>Give up your use of threats</em> means “do not say that you will hurt or punish them.” Paul is giving a specific example of how masters should not treat their slaves. An example of threatening is to say in an angry voice: “Get up! Do your work now or I will beat you!” Most languages have a word or phrase for this kind of talk.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stop using threats (GNT)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Do not say to them, “I will beat you if you do not obey me!”</p></blockquote><h4>6:9c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>because you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>because you know that they have the same master in heaven as you do,</p></li><li><p>Remember that you and they have the same master who is in heaven,</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>because you know:</strong> The clause <em>because you know</em> is exactly the same as “because you know” in 6:8a. Consider if it would be appropriate to translate it in the same way here.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven:</strong> This refers to the Lord Jesus. In Greek the word for master is <em>kurios</em>, the same word that is translated “Lord.” If your language has different words for “master” and “Lord”, you may want to translate something like this:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>You should always remember that you who are masters and those who are your slaves all have the same <span data-bnType=\"implied\">big</span> master in heaven; that is, the Lord.</p></blockquote><h4>6:9d</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:9d\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and there is no favoritism with Him.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>and he treats everyone alike.</p></li><li><p>and he does not treat some people differently from the way he treats other people.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>there is no favoritism with Him:</strong> The word <em>favoritism</em> means “treat one person better than another.” Paul is saying that the Lord treats slaves and masters in the same way.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate this clause:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Translate this meaning using a negative. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He does not distinguish between people</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He does not treat people differently</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use positive terms. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>He treats all people in the same way</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he treats everyone alike (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>he judges everyone by one standard (similar to GNT)</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Use an idiom. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God does not look at people’s faces</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>God is not soft on some people and hard on other people</p></blockquote></li></ul><p data-indent=\"2\">Choose the translation that is most vivid and accurate in your language.</p>",

A soldier gets all his special clothing and weapons ready so he can fight. His <em>armor</em> protects him. In the same way we must use all the things that God has given us to protect us, so we can fight against the devil.</p><h4>6:11b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:11b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that you can make your stand against the devil’s schemes.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that you<sup>(plur)</sup> will be able to resist/refuse the devil’s tricks.</p></li><li><p>so that when Satan tries to deceive/trick you, you can oppose/resist him.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that you can make your stand:</strong> To <em>make your stand</em> means “to oppose,” “to successfully resist,” or “to fight back and not give in.” When a soldier is fighting well he does not go backwards or retreat.

In 6:11 in the Greek text, Paul used a verb that means, “put on.” Here, he used a different verb that means, “pick up” or “take.” But these verbs mean almost the same thing, and you can translate it here using the same verb that you used in 6:11.</p><h4>6:13b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your ground,</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>so that when evil comes, you<sup>(plur)</sup> will be able to resist it.</p></li><li><p>in order that when <span data-bnType=\"implied\">the devil and his</span> evil <span data-bnType=\"implied\">spirits</span> attack you, you will be able to resist/oppose them.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>so that when the day of evil comes:</strong> The phrase <em>day of evil</em> is a figure of speech. It refers to a time when suffering, trouble and bad things happen. This is any time that the Christian has to fight against evil. It is not the final battle between God and the forces of evil. It does not refer to a literal, single day.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>these evil days (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>in the time of evil (NLT)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>you will be able to stand your ground:</strong> The phrase <em>you will be able</em> here does not suggest potential or the possibility of doubt.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>stand your ground:</strong> The phrase <em>stand your ground</em> is a figure of speech. The verb <em>stand</em> is the same verb as in 6:11b. It means “to oppose,” “to resist,” or “to fight back and not give in.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate <em>stand your ground</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>standing firm (NLT, CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>stand strong (NCV)</p></blockquote><h4>6:13c</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:13c\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>and having done everything, to stand.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>When you<sup>(plur)</sup> have done everything, you<sup>(plur)</sup> will stand firmly.</p></li><li><p>After you have done everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to prepare yourselves for the battle</span>, you will not retreat.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>and having done everything:</strong> There is an interpretation issue here. There are at least two ways to understand the Greek verb that the BSB translates as <em>having done</em>. It can mean:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>after accomplishing or <u>doing everything</u> to prepare for battle and resist an attack. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>and after you have done everything (NIV) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NET, REB, NASB, KJV, NJB)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>after overcoming, that is, after <u>fighting the whole battle</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>And when you have finished the whole fight (NCV) <em>(GNT, NCV, NLT, CEV)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). This is the normal meaning of the verb and has good commentary support.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>everything:</strong> Many English versions do not specify what is included in the word <em>everything</em>. Commentators differ as to the exact details of what <em>everything</em> includes. It probably includes all the things a soldier must do before a battle to prepare himself. Perhaps it also includes the things he would do during the battle. If possible, your translation should not be too specific. If you need to make it specific, you can say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>After you have done everything <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to prepare for battle</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>to stand:</strong> As in 6:11b and 6:13b, <em>to</em> <em>stand</em> means “to oppose,” “to resist,” or “to fight back and not give in.” This phrase is a restatement of the overall goal of putting on the full armor of God. After having done everything necessary to prepare for the battles, at the end of the battles he will be left still standing victorious.</p><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesGeneralComment\"><h5><strong>General Comment on 6:13</strong></h5><p data-indent=\"1\">Here is a way to translate 6:13 using an “if-then” clause:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Therefore, put on/wear all the fight clothes God gives us.

The Christian’s enemies are not human, but supernatural. Christians are fighting against the devil and all the powers of evil, and they must use all the weapons that God gives them. Paul described six pieces of equipment that the Roman soldier of that time used (see the picture below), and he compared each one to something spiritual that will help Christians to overcome Satan. Then Paul also reminded Christians to pray at all times. He told them to pray for their fellow believers and to pray for him so that he would be able to proclaim the gospel without fear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wear the full armour of God (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Put on all the armour that God supplies (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christians should prepare and fight against evil spiritual forces</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050006014\" data-endVerseId=\"1050006020\"><h3>Paragraph 6:14–20</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul used six metaphors to describe the way a Christian should prepare himself to fight against Satan. Paul based these metaphors on the armor a Roman soldier wore. The specific pieces of armor are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>belt (6:14b)</p></li><li><p>breastplate (6:14c)</p></li><li><p>shoes (6:15)</p></li><li><p>shield (6:16b–c)</p></li><li><p>helmet (6:17a)</p></li><li><p>sword (6:17b)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In many places in the world, people do not know what breastplates, helmets, shields and other armor of the Roman soldiers looked like.

It was probably a wide belt, not just some thin strings of leather. See the belt of a soldier in the picture at Section 6:10–20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In Paul’s time, a soldier used a <em>belt</em> to tie his loose clothing round his waist. He did this so that he could move faster and more freely in battle. A belt also helped to protect the soldier’s waist.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">The phrase <em>belt of truth</em> is also a metaphor. Paul compared <em>truth</em> to a <em>belt</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to fully explain this metaphor is like this: The truth that God gives you is like a Roman soldier’s belt. The belt holds up his long clothes so that he is able to run and fight. God’s truth supports you in your fight with Satan.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>belt of truth buckled:</strong> The Greek text is literally “having tied your waist with truth.” Notice that the word <em>belt</em> does not occur in Greek.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Some languages may be like Greek and have a verb like “tie” to indicate this action. Other languages will have to translate this as the BSB and supply the word <em>belt</em>. Another simple way to say this is:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>the rope to tie your waist</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"3\"><strong>truth:</strong> Paul did not specifically say what aspect of truth he was talking about. Scholars interpret this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>“God’s truth” or “the truth about God”</p></li><li><p>“tell the truth” or “be truthful”</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If you can translate without specifying the type of truth, it is better to do so. If you must make a choice, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1).</p><p data-indent=\"2\">In some languages, the word “true” may be more natural than the word <em>truth</em>. If this is the case in your language, you could say something like:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>do what you know to be true</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate 6:14b:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. Some ways to express the metaphor are:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Take truth and tie your waist with it.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Tie the belt round your waist.

It protected him from the enemy’s swords, arrows and spears. It was made of tough leather or metal. See the breastplate of a soldier in the picture at Section 6:10–20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is a metaphor. Paul compared <em>righteousness</em> to a <em>breastplate</em>. One way to fully explain this metaphor is like this: “Just as a breastplate protects a soldier in a battle, so your confidence in the truth of Christ making you righteous will protect you when Satan attacks you.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>righteousness:</strong> Paul did not specifically say what aspect of <em>righteousness</em> he was talking about. Scholars interpret this in two ways:</p><ol type=\"1\" data-indent=\"2\"><li><p><u>God’s righteousness</u> or God considers a believer as righteous because of Christ. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>let God’s justice protect you like armor <em>(CEV, NLT, GW)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p><u>The believer does what is right</u> or the believer has behavior that is righteous/upright. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>the protection of right living on your chest <em>(NCV, REB)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">If you can translate without specifying the type of <em>righteousness</em>, it is better to do so. Many English versions do this (BSB, NIV, RSV, GNT and others). If you must make a choice, it is recommended that you follow interpretation (1). See righteous in the Glossary.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some ways to translate 6:14c:</p><ul data-indent=\"2\"><li><p>Keep the metaphor. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Put on Christ’s right behavior as your breastplate.</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Put on the breastplate.

For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>In addition to all these (GW) <em>(BSB, NIV, RSV, NASB, REB, GW, NLT)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><p>It means <u>At all times</u> or <u>always</u>. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>At all times (GNT) <em>(GNT, NJB, ESV, NLT96)</em></p></blockquote></li></ol><p data-indent=\"2\">It is recommended that you follow interpretation (1) and the greater number of versions.

A soldier held it in one hand out in front of himself to protect himself from his enemies’ weapons.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">A <em>shield</em> was made of wooden boards fastened together, covered with cloth and then leather. Before a battle, a soldier would soak his shield in water so that it would not burn when enemies shot flaming arrows at him. See the shield of a soldier in the picture at Section 6:10–20.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">This is also a metaphor. Paul compared <em>faith</em> to a <em>shield</em>.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">One way to fully explain this metaphor is like this: “Just as a shield protects a soldier in a battle, so if you trust in God, he will protect you when Satan attacks you.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> Here <em>faith</em> means to trust or believe in God. See how you translated <em>faith</em> in 1:15b and 3:12a.

The Christian’s enemies are not human, but supernatural. Christians are fighting against the devil and all the powers of evil, and they must use all the weapons that God gives them. Paul described six pieces of equipment that the Roman soldier of that time used (see the picture below), and he compared each one to something spiritual that will help Christians to overcome Satan. Then Paul also reminded Christians to pray at all times. He told them to pray for their fellow believers and to pray for him so that he would be able to proclaim the gospel without fear.</p><p data-indent=\"1\">Here are some other examples for a heading for this section:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Wear the full armour of God (NCV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Put on all the armour that God supplies (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>Christians should prepare and fight against evil spiritual forces</p></blockquote></div><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesParagraph\" data-startVerseId=\"1050006014\" data-endVerseId=\"1050006020\"><h3>Paragraph 6:14–20</h3><p data-indent=\"1\">In this paragraph, Paul used six metaphors to describe the way a Christian should prepare himself to fight against Satan. Paul based these metaphors on the armor a Roman soldier wore. The specific pieces of armor are:</p><ol type=\"a\" data-indent=\"1\"><li><p>belt (6:14b)</p></li><li><p>breastplate (6:14c)</p></li><li><p>shoes (6:15)</p></li><li><p>shield (6:16b–c)</p></li><li><p>helmet (6:17a)</p></li><li><p>sword (6:17b)</p></li></ol><p data-indent=\"1\">In many places in the world, people do not know what breastplates, helmets, shields and other armor of the Roman soldiers looked like. So you may want to put a picture of a Roman soldier in your Bible translation at this place when it is printed.</p></div><h4>6:20a</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:20a\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>for which I am an ambassador in chains.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>I am a representative <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Christ</span> to explain/tell this good news, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">and that is the reason that people have put me</span> in prison.</p></li><li><p>Is is for this gospel that I am Christ’s representative even while I am in prison.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>for which I am an ambassador:</strong> An <em>ambassador</em> is a representative, a spokesman, an important person sent to another country to represent his king or president. In your translation you should make it clear that it is Jesus Christ whom Paul represents. Paul is saying that he is an ambassador of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is another way to translate this phrase:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am a spokesman/representative <span data-bnType=\"implied\">of Jesus Christ</span>, <span data-bnType=\"implied\">whom he commissioned</span> to proclaim the good news <span data-bnType=\"implied\">about him</span></p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>in chains:</strong> The phrase <em>in chains</em> is a figure of speech. When Paul was in prison, his hands and feet were sometimes bound with chains. So <em>in chains</em> means “in prison.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">You can translate <em>in chains</em> as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>even though I am in prison</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>and that is why I am in prison</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">Here is the connection between Paul being Christ’s ambassador and Paul’s being in prison: Jesus chose Paul to be his ambassador to preach the gospel. But people who hated Jesus wanted to stop Paul from preaching the gospel, so they had Paul arrested. That is why Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter to the Ephesians.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate 6:20a:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I was sent to do this work, and that’s the reason I am in jail (CEV)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I am in chains now, still preaching this message as God’s ambassador. (NLT)</p></blockquote><h4>6:20b</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:20b\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly, as I should.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>So pray <span data-bnType=\"implied\">to God for me</span> that he will give me courage to preach the good news as I should.</p></li><li><p>So pray that I will continue to boldly preach <span data-bnType=\"implied\">God’s message</span> as I ought to do.</p></li></ul></div><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly:</strong> This clause is a summary of Paul’s appeal in 6:19. It is repeated to emphasize what he said in 6:19. Translate it in a way that keeps this emphasis.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>it:</strong> The word <em>it</em> refers to “the mystery of the gospel” in 6:19b.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>fearlessly:</strong> The word that the BSB translates as <em>fearlessly</em> is similar to the word that the BSB translated as “boldly” in 6:19b. See how you translated that word there.</p><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>as I should:</strong> In referring to himself as Christ’s ambassador, Paul felt it was his duty to boldly represent Christ. That is, boldly tell others the “good news.”</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate the phrase <em>as I should</em>:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as I have to (GW)</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>as I ought to speak (RSV)</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"></p>",

Paul ended some of his letters with a short blessing, such as “Grace be with you all” (Titus 3:15, see also Colossians 4:18, 1 Thessalonians 5:28, 2 Thessalonians 3:18, 1 Timothy 6:21 and 2 Timothy 4:22). In other letters he has a longer blessing at the end (see Romans 16:25–27, 2 Corinthians 13:14).</p><h4>6:23</h4><div data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptions\" data-verse=\"6:23\"><p data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsDefaultOption\"><strong>Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</strong></p><ul data-bnType=\"OpenTranslatorsNotesTranslationOptionsAdditionalTranslationOptions\"><li><p>May God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ give peace to you, the believers.

It can also refer to having a good relationship with God. See how you translated <em>Peace</em> in 1:2 and 6:15.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>brothers:</strong> The word <em>brothers</em> should be translated so as to include the women believers too, but avoid a long construction. You could say:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>all the believers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">It is unusual that Paul uses the third person instead of the second person here. That is, he says “Peace to <u>the brothers</u>” instead of “Peace to <u>you</u>.” Some translators prefer to translate this as:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>Peace be to <span data-bnType=\"implied\">you</span> Christian brothers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">You may use the second person if the third person is unnatural or would be misleading.</p><p data-indent=\"2\">Here are some other ways to translate “Peace to the brothers”:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p><span data-bnType=\"implied\">May God give</span> peace to the brothers</p></blockquote><blockquote data-indent=\"3\"><p>I pray to God and ask him to give peace to the brothers</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"1\"><strong>love with faith:</strong> In 1:15 Paul told the Ephesian Christians that he had heard about their “faith in the Lord Jesus” and their “love for all the saints.” Now here at the end of his letter, he prays that they will continue to have <em>love</em> and <em>faith</em>. It may be more natural for you to translate these nouns by verbs. For example:</p><blockquote data-indent=\"2\"><p>love each other and continue believing in Christ</p></blockquote><p data-indent=\"2\">See love, meaning 2 in the Glossary for more information.</p><p data-indent=\"2\"><strong>faith:</strong> Here, the word <em>faith</em> refers to the action of trusting and believing in Jesus Christ.
